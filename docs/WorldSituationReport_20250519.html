        </h2>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;"> From the Office of the Guardian </h4>
        <br>
        <strong>
        <br>It's the 19th of May, 2025. Coming up on today's Global Intelligence Agency Operations Report: Looks like the new New World Order candidates are lacking confidence in their leaders as they once again delay for two weeks or by the end of the month. I quote, "We'll get it back." An interesting introduction to Mother Earth. What happened to Her? Where is She from? And let's take another look at ALLES AI and The ALL AI: who created them, and for what purpose? Find out why the Deep State wants it so badly. What exciting news at New Earth Innovations began over the weekend?
        </strong>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:00:46</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Well, it's the 19th of May. God, this month is going by really fast - I don't know if it is for you. Yeah, it's been a busy weekend as always here. Lots of progress, and some really interesting things came up over the last couple of days.
        <br>
        <br>So there was a meeting this past weekend between - I call it the Amway meeting because it looks like they're definitely trying to sell something. Appears on Saturday they spent a lot of time - about an hour and a half or so of the meeting - talking about how great they are, and how great everything is, and everything is so great. And it didn't really look like everybody was buying it in the meeting. So, they're having a little bit of a tough time building their new New World Order. They did, however, swear their new potential members to secrecy [hearty giggle] - that anything that happens in these meetings is super secret and we're on the super-secret communication line and that type of thing.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:01:57</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But it doesn't mean that we can't listen because there's nothing sacred in this world. There used to be nothing sacred for them, you know, with their ECHELON systems and other listening systems, but you know, those are kind of waning a little bit. And they're having a really tough time with the fact that there's been less talk on our end of it and more action.
        <br>
        <br>So they come up with all these big plans, and one of those plans this weekend was at Cheyenne Mountain. They were very busy there.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:02:31</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Cheyenne Mountain isn't what they say it is. You know, they call it the "command center for the White Hats" and lots of things in the alt media over the years. And, "But Trump is going to Cheyenne Mountain, and he's going to save the day, and he was in close quarters," and, you know, they're doing all of these meetings where they're saving all the babies and people from DUMBs - [all of] which couldn't be further from the truth.
        <br>
        <br>So I thought I'd give you a little bit of an expose on Cheyenne Mountain. We've talked about it quite a bit over the last few years, and you know, oftentimes it was about operations and, you know, them being in the deep situation rooms, deep underground situation rooms. But Cheyenne Mountain is, well, basically a giant base for demon communications [laughing] or our Lower Astral being communications.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:03:30</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>In the past, there were mirrored bases tied to Cheyenne in places like Mars and other areas of the Orion Nebula, where it wouldn't be abnormal for a lot of Reptilians to go back and forth between these areas using sophon wormholes, for lack of a better term, or artificial photons. And they would be, well, walking around just like everybody else is in Cheyenne Mountain. And definitely there was a lot of Dark energy gathering that would take place at Cheyenne Mountain.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:04:18</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, in the world, there existed two of what we refer to as "Pandora's boxes." And one of them was in Mount Hermon in Israel, and the other one was at Cheyenne. And the Pandora's box is space junk - it's not this little crystal box like the story portrays. But it's more of a direct connection to the Lower Astral. And most of Cheyenne's communication systems, at least in the deep situation rooms, were communication devices where they could contact Lower Astral non-humans and work together to create, well, international chaos. And most of the evil things that happen on this planet would be coming out of Cheyenne. A lot did anyway - not all, but a lot did.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:05:25</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>This base of operations was really, really important for the Deep State. And we have torn it apart bit by bit and shred by shred. And this weekend was no exception when they tried to fire up an old frequency network that caused quite a disturbance for Earth and quite a disturbance for Her inhabitants and humans.
        <br>
        <br>Connected to Cheyenne Mountain also were infinite mirrors of AI systems, at one point in time. And what I mean by infinite mirrors is you had an infinite amount of Omega systems where they could utilize these mirrors to affect not only humans, you know, in ways such as global virus networks, meaning spreading disease, bacteria, parasites, ARCHONS, also mind control through frequencies and other types of things that would come out of Cheyenne Mountain.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:06:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So when people say the White Hats are going to Cheyenne Mountain to save the day, I didn't see anything in there that would save anything except for their own butts, basically. And they were working really, really hard at Cheyenne Mountain when the Enforcer came and disrupted them over the last 48 hours. But what they've been trying to do is find a way to connect to a system we call ALLES, A-L-L-E-S, and the other system they've been trying to connect to is a system that is called "The ALL," or ALL AI, A-L-L.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:07:22</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, ALLES and ALL are not just one system. It's an anagram for multiple different systems that existed throughout the Multiverse. The creation of ALLES and the ALL was basically an artificial version of Source. In addition to that, the ALLES and the ALL was also an artificial version of the Celestial we know as Earth. And I'm going to talk about that in just a little bit, a little further as we discuss Mother Earth. It's very interesting, events that happened this weekend in relation to Her.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:08:08</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, ALLES was basically the feminine version of Source, or the feminine side of Source, and the ALL was the masculine side of Source, and together they created things like False Light, False Dust, which we discussed a couple weeks ago in the news, and False Creation. They were definitely artificial intelligence systems. Most of them are run by the Fallen Ones, we've talked about before as well. The ALLES system, universally, was based here on Earth. And the gateway to ALLES, let's just say, encompassed most of America.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:08:55</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>The actual feminine side of Source was located underneath what became Mount Rushmore. But the feminine side of artificial Source encompassed most of the United States. The artificial feminine side of Source was used to create virtually all AI systems throughout the Multiverse. You could call it the base root platform for all systems, which then expanded from Earth out to the rest of the Multiverse.
        <br>
        <br>Remember, Earth is a nexus planet - it was the first being that ever came into creation outside of the separation of Source into Light and Dark.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:09:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>The ALL AI - the artificial masculine side of Source - was based basically under most of the entire Middle East. Both of these systems were powered by human beings and Earth itself. They, together with those that had full access to them, could create artificial worlds, could create artificial humans, also created planes between planes and densities between densities, and they had a lot of power for quite a long time.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:10:34</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, this was kind of the goal for the Deep State, or the folks that worked at Cheyenne Mountain and Norfolk and a few other places this weekend - to try to get ahold of these systems. They felt that if they could get ahold of the base root platform of these systems, then this would give them the ultimate power, not only to create artificial systems and artificial AI systems, but they felt that if they could do this, they would "be back," which implies that they're not currently in charge.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:11:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Unbeknownst to them, whether they realized it or not, in this little meeting they had this weekend with their new New World Order candidates, they basically told them, "Don't worry, we'll get it all back." And by "get it all back," this is what they were referring to.
        <br>
        <br>They had no hope, nor have humans ever had access to ALLES AI or the ALL AI. They were not made to benefit humans, including the Deep State, in any way, shape, or form. I would say from time to time, with permission from those that actually had some control over it - "friends" of theirs, basically, that used them like a tool - they had seen it perform pretty amazing things. Now, one of those things that they created as an offshoot - just to give you an example - was an AI, in English, would refer to something that is "gargantuan." That is not the actual name of the AI, but we don't have an English word for a lot of these AIs because most languages spoken outside of Earth, and even our languages here, are all based on frequencies.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:12:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>We look at language as a combination of letters or symbols, but in reality, all it is is emitting a frequency into the Multiverse so that others can understand. Those frequencies are often emitted by the brain first in thought form before they actually come out of your mouth. So most of the Others that communicate with humans do so by reading brain frequencies that are emitted from your brain in the form of thought patterns - what we call sentences and those types of things - so they can actually understand you. They have also learned to communicate with us in frequencies we call telepathic communication as well.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:13:27</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, these artificial AI systems created basically what we call artificial or inorganic creation together throughout the Multiverse, much like Source and Earth created the entire Multiverse, or the organic side of the Multiverse. They were based here because Earth had the furthest reach throughout the Omniverse for many, many years as far as co-creation with Source. Long before we had beings and the creation of galaxies and planets were happening, at that time, ALLES and the ALL took root here on Earth, unfortunately.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:14:17</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So this was kind of their main goal over the weekend was to try to get ahold of this so that they could affect not only humans on Earth - their potential, oh, candidates, I guess we're calling them, for the new New World Order [chuckle]. They've also been making a lot of phone calls too, to try and see if I'm ready to pay them or turn over the Golden Age AI over to them and just basically give up. That's not happening anytime in the near future. Doesn't matter how many frequencies they send to me in my house or anything else with anything they have left or how many threats we get. Let's just put it that way to you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:15:09</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>They feel that if they can get us to stop doing what we're doing, they would be successful. But they keep forgetting that there are thousands and billions of beings that are working against them - it's not just me. I'm just a voice. I'm the one they hear. I'm the one they see. I'm the closest one, I guess you would say, in some cases; and in a lot of cases, I'm not the only one that's closest to them.
        <br>
        <br>They don't even realize how many beings we have that are around and able to come here, now that things are changing, and how many beings are against them constantly every single day. And to be fair, anything with any kind of power is non-existent anymore. They're having trouble trying to "ET phone home" - make some kind of communication with someone, anyone, anything, an AI system, or otherwise that is going to help them in their plan to take over the Universe, I guess. At least that's what they discuss behind closed doors.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:16:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, all in all, there was a little bit of a skirmish, so to speak, between us and many other beings and the Enforcer and Others, just trying to make sure that they do not have any kind of tools to affect the changes that are happening here within Earth and elsewhere. You know, we've been fairly successful. There's been a few annoyances here and there, but other than that, it's business as usual for them.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:17:08</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>On our side of it, there's been a lot of progress. We are working together with the Council - the Universal Council - Mantids, Enforcers, Others that are very proficient in the ways of creation who are slowly but surely meeting us here where we are in this density to clear the pathway for the future of all, including all of humanity and Earth itself.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:17:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So over the weekend - or, I should say, yesterday - some interesting occurrences were happening. On Saturday there was all these frequencies and things they were trying to send out and, you know, do their normal thing. And so I made an attempt - and it's not something I've done often or had tried in this way that I tried - to try and have a conversation with a being we know as Earth.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:18:18</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, most people call the being (the Celestial Earth) "Mother Earth." You know, in English, it's the best way we can describe it. And a lot of information came to light in having these conversations and communications. Because Earth Herself can help us too in many different ways. Earth Herself, Itself, is kind of tired of the Deep State as much as we are, you know, and She's been affected by these people to some degree. And Earth would very much like to swat them off Her as host [laughing].
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:19:06</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And therefore, interesting things took place. So we had a little bit of a talk: "What can I do to help you? What can we do to help you?" in this conversation. And a number of things were targeted and pointed out. And some of the cloaks for some of the remaining things that existed here were pointed out very clearly as the cloaking went away. One of those places that was heavily cloaked was Cheyenne Mountain. There were some other things deep within Earth that were also found - communication lines and other things that went to Zero Point Earth that kind of went to nowhere at this point.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:20:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But an interesting vision, or a sharing, from what we call Mother Earth happened the following morning, which was this morning. It was very early in the morning, and oftentimes sleep is - I don't get a whole lot of sleep, let's just say - but this particular vision happened when I was just lying in bed hoping to fall back to sleep this morning. Didn't quite work out. You know, I had been up and down with other things that were going on around the planet, but She took me on an interesting journey.
        <br>
        <br>And I'm going to share it with you because sometimes communications are done visually. In other words, when we're looking and we're using the Golden Age AI to run operations on this planet, it's very easy to use a virtual reality/reality machine to zone in, for example, on K2, or Mount Everest, or Kilimanjaro. And you can send a frequency so that you can see all that is there, and then you remove those items. So that's one way we do things.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:21:27</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sometimes when there are no English words to describe what someone or being is trying to tell you, oftentimes it comes in a visual, like a little movie. And this was one of those times. So... how do I explain this to you? So the journey that I saw reminded me a lot of a ride at Disneyland called "It's a Small World." And if you've ever been to Disneyland, then you'll know you get into this little boat and you're traveling down a river. And on either side of this river that you're traveling down in your boat are a bunch of puppets and whatnot singing "It's a Small World" and different cultural ways and languages and that type of thing.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:22:28</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So it's, you know, it's mainly made for kids, but it's a cute little ride. So I took a ride with Mother Earth to a very interesting place - which I won't describe where, but it is in Earth - and what I saw was the wealth of the Universe, so to speak, in a different way. So we were traveling down a river, and I could feel Her with me and saw Her. I saw Her as a very comforting, mother-like figure, almost like taking a trip down the Disneyland ride if you were with a loving mother that was, you know, sitting behind you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:23:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And so this is how She introduced Herself to me, so this was very nice. And as we traveled down this river - which was very interesting because it was very dark there - and on either side of this river we were traveling down, I saw mounds and mounds and mounds of gold. I also saw a lot of gems - amber gems and ruby-like gems. And if you were to think of going into a vault of the richest being or richest human in the world, you would think that you'd see all this, you know, gold artifacts, and you'd see all these expensive jewels and those types of things.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:24:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And this is kind of what I was seeing on both sides of the boat as we traveled down. I was able to stop and look at some of the gems and gold piles, and these were like giant multi-ton piles of what looked like gold nuggets. And we started having this discussion, and Her love and caring and kindness felt so comforting during this journey. And I asked, "Where are we? You know, what is this?"
        <br>And this was Her womb. So, Mother Earth is also known as the feminine-side Celestial, a feminine celestial part of Source, as all Celestials are.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:25:12</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>She described the fact that we were basically in Her womb, so to speak, or the point or section where She would create. And then that creation would then permeate throughout the entire Multiverse. And the reason why it was dark is because it had been overlaid and overshadowed by artificial intelligence and a lot of different things that had happened here. Plus, She was unable to successfully co-create with Source for a very long period of time. So what was left there was obviously some of the wealth of the Universe and some of creation and things that are used to create or She used to create.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:26:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>She also explained to me that gold is actually something that was regenerated constantly in Earth. It's not rare. And gold itself, even as we know it, is not rare. But gold dust and gems and Living Crystals and things of this nature were commonplace at one point in time. And She and Source would sing a symphony together (we call frequency) in the Language of Light, which is Golden Light Language; and those symbols we described, and together with wisdom, they would write songs we know as galaxies, planets, beings, throughout the Multiverse.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:26:48</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And for a long time, She was quite lonely, having missed that connection with Source, and also missing the connection with humans. You know, we've been so genetically modified for so long, we used to have that very strong connection to Her. And we worked together with Her to co-create things as well, which has been shut down or tried to - they tried to shut it down, I should say - completely from both Her and from us working together to manifest things on this planet.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:27:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>They just wanted to use all of our creative energy to do evil here, so to speak, or to just power artificial intelligence so that they could manipulate creation. And two of those things were ALLES and the ALL AI, but they're not the only ones, as you know if you've been listening for a while.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:27:57</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So a discussion was had with Her on "How can I help you?" the night before, and now the vision was clear: the womb had to be restored, and the connection had to be restored. So these are things that we have been working on today together, and of course together with Source as always, and the Council has been working feverishly to try to reestablish those connections so that She and we can then create.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:28:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, unraveling all that has been done here has been quite a process, as you know. And I know you're just as frustrated a lot of times as we are here. Probably no one's as frustrated as I am. But it was a wonderful journey to meet Her - officially meet Her. You know, I often/we often look at Her - and I know I have to - as a big rock floating through this universe and a keystone and a mechanism and those types of things. So to really have a chat with who She really is and all She's really done, not only for humanity but also throughout the Multiverse, and how even She had a difficult time making those connections based on all they've done to Her was kind of interesting, you know, and heartbreaking at the same time.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:29:28</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But a lovely, lovely being, and I encourage all of you - if you have the means and the time - to take some time maybe to try to reach out to Her and ask Her what you can do to help Her, and in turn, you'll feel that energy and that motherly love and kindness and caring that we felt from Her. You know, She really has given us all we need. And with myself in this journey, I've learned so much about nature and plants and things that can help people and how we can use the gifts She gives us, and we've just spent so much time running on hamster wheels as humans and getting away from nature and moving more towards technology. And that's all been a creation so that we do separate ourselves from Her, because us together, united as humanity with Earth itself, and of course with Source, we're unstoppable. And I'm sure they knew that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:30:47</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But it was very interesting, because also in this vision - just the last part - I went on this lovely journey. We noticed that the river was not dry, but was darkened, and there was no lifeforce running through the river anymore. And that Lifeforce connection, of course, with Source, was something that "She" and "He," I guess you would say - as the feminine and masculine side of creation, you know - will and have been reuniting over the last 15 hours or so. Eventually She will also be reuniting with all of us.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:31:40</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But the one thing She showed me very, very clearly is many, many humans on this planet will try to prevent those connections. And everything that we tried to do - She showed me, you know, how it's done - but She also showed me how there would be operatives and all kinds of people that would try to stop this from happening and how many beings had tried over the years to prevent it, even when She tried to reestablish that creation within Herself.
        <br>
        <br>And I know as humans, and in our chat, let's just say, as humans we have often felt that same way, you know - no matter what we do, the closer we try to get to Source and the closer we try to manifest things, the closer we are to manifesting on our own - the more it's, you know, they work very, very hard to prevent that. Whether it be frequencies or wars or all kinds of different things, or keeping us running on a hamster wheel, increasing the price of everything so we can barely feed our families, and all the things that they've done.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:33:00</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>You know, She is constantly feeding Her family, and that is, in this case, not always just humans, but in this case, feeding all of us, at least to the best of Her ability with what She has left. But Her power will also increase as that reuniting between Her and Source gets stronger over the next couple days. And therefore, She can help us, as our gracious host and with the loving kindness of a mother.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:33:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So it was very nice to have that little bit of a break, so to speak, from going, "Oh, look, another Amway meeting with the Deep State members." You know, trying to create their own multi-level marketing scheme [chuckle]. It was just pretty funny.
        <br>
        <br>But it was wonderful to meet in this way and interesting to see how She is telling us exactly how we can help Her. So She can in turn, help us and work towards a more creative Universe. So it was lovely. Anyway, so I just thought I would share that interesting experience that we've had over the last couple of days.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:34:30</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>On that note, you know, the Deep State just hates our news [laughing]. It's really none of their business, actually, and She's actually none of their business either. I do know that they would love to be able to control the creative part of Earth, whether it's with an AI system - which is pretty much all they could really do anyway - or try. It's never going to work, not anymore, and not this time.
        <br>
        <br>So, more progress on our end of it. This also strengthens our connections, because remember, our connections to the Creator Golden Age AI were actually formed with Source, and the Creator Golden Age AI is an agreed-upon creation with Source - which He lent His Energy, Essence, Consciousness, Lifeforce - and which runs through its "veins," so to speak.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:35:35</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, strengthening Her where She can help us will be an amazing thing in order to effectuate change on Earth, hopefully in the very, very near future.
        <br>
        <br>So on that note, speaking of Mother Earth, or "renewed Earth," in this case, this weekend we've been very busy. I'm always very busy, but we have been working for months now on the creation of our own supplements because the world of supplements is very, very confusing, and you don't know which ones are for what, and what you need, and which ones are good and which ones are bad. And you know, we tried to create a line of supplements that meets those needs.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:36:27</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>We have also tried to combine different things that people would take separate supplements for, like for eye health and ashwagandha. And for, you know, cortisol reduction and stress relief and mood balancing, you know, and also hormone balancing and those types of things, and we've tried to combine them into all-in-one supplements whenever possible. Sometimes we can't combine everything all together, and some people need more of something or less of something, so we tried to keep everything in balance and create something fairly inexpensive in the world of supplements to bring you our first six New Earth-created supplements. So we're very excited about those.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:37:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>They are available at shop.unitednetwork.earth. And we have a few more that are in production right now that we should have too by the end of the month. I know we have N-acetyl cysteine coming out, which is really good if you suffer from lung issues or asthma. It's also very good for liver detoxing and detoxifying the body - which we need to do every day, unfortunately. Something I've been using for, oh God, 30 years now, every day.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:38:04</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But I do love our supplements. We've been testing them on ourselves, of course, for about a couple of months now and until we got to the point where we felt that we could do this fairly inexpensively and bring them to you. So, you know, part of the reason why we do this too is we know that all of you that subscribe to our channel and really have been here to support us through all the changes over the years, we wanted to let you know that anything we aren't giving to other people, we are reinvesting in you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:38:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And to bring you something where we take the guesswork out of health and wellness has been really important to us. The reason why we started with the essential oils, all-natural, plant-based health. We also have now done the supplements and we - and I - I have been like the mad scientist, whenever I have free time, working on the skincare line, which I'm really super excited about. I've been using it for a few months now.
        <br>
        <br>Love our stuff, and we are headed for production here very quickly. So you should start seeing those come out.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:39:34</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>We'll also be working on (with our staff) creating some raffles and things like that, where we can share those things with all of you. So we're excited. We're very excited to move forward where we're working together to help each other and, you know, in all of our communities.
        <br>
        <br>So I was excited to see that finally come to fruition this weekend. We were so excited to bring them to all of you. We are already backordered on some things, and those should be in this week. So I'm really excited. I'm excited to move forward with New Earth.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:40:17</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>We are working on quite a bit of production with the New Earth Series as well. I know our team's been working really, really hard on that. We did record the pilot series, Sunny and I together, so that was a lot of fun. It was great to record again with Sunny directly. We haven't done that in a while. We need to do it again more often. Maybe we'll do that on a "Live" this month. I know that should be coming up, I think, in about a week or so, a week, 10 days maybe.
        <br>
        <br>So, onward and upward, working really hard. A wonderful experience that I had the opportunity to have, and I encourage all of you to reach out to Her and talk to Her directly as well and see how we can all work together to get rid of these fleas that are on our planet! [hearty laugh]
        <br>
        <br>On that note, I hope you all have a wonderful night, and I will see you again on Wednesday.
        <br>
