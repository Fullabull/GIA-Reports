World Situation Report
<br>2024-Nov-11 GIA Report</h2>

00:00

<!-- TEASER:-->

<h3>Today is the 11th of November 2024. Coming up on the Global Intelligence Agency Operations Report: The modus operandi of The Order of the Black Sun is "Conquer the Quest." Find out what it is and what is the plan. Today is also 11/11, and the Deep State has some big plans that could have wiped out as much as 48% of all life on this planet. But it seems Source had other plans. Could this just seal the fate of the globalists? And what is the Alpha Anti-Genesis Project? And when would it occur?</h3>

<br>00:45
<br>
<br>Well, it's the 11th of November. 11/11 everyone. Lots to talk about. Sorry for missing Friday's report - it was really, really, really busy on Friday. And we're going to talk a lot about that. I have a lot of stuff to cover, and I just want to address a couple quick things because this report hopefully will explain things to you in more detail.
<br>
<br>01:15
<br>
<br>So there's some of you that have been commenting on the threads about, "Is it all about the USA?" I've gotten some messages from some of you that watch this report, and it's not really about the USA - obviously this is a worldwide... everybody; all of humanity is involved. I know it feels like the last couple of reports were about the U.S., especially probably with the interview with George, but he chose the topic; it was his show, and this is what he wanted to talk about.
<br>
<br>01:51
<br>
<br>As far as my report that seemed "very angry" when it came to the results of the election, I want you to please understand me when I tell you that to you Trump is a president. To me, he's a member of The Order of the Black Sun; he is of a certain bloodline, and he had a certain role to play on this planet. The fact that they put him in a House or not in a House doesn't really matter - it's what the operatives are doing behind the scenes and what everybody else has an intention of doing to all of you.
<br>
<br>02:35
<br>
<br>So there have been some reports on the Internet circulating about taking up a military camp in the state of Arizona and that they were also part of the election fraud. It's all about protecting the border. There are also rumors going around about the National Guard moving on U.S. citizens. If you haven't heard that one, that is true. There was a meeting on Friday night at the Pentagon where they were told to prepare for movement of U.S. troops on U.S. soil against U.S. citizens between now - meaning Friday [Nov 8th] - and the 17th of November. And there is a reason why they were saying that. And we're going to get into that. It's not just an American thing.
<br>
<br>03:33
<br>
<br>There are also some crazy orders coming from the Trump operatives, and rumor has it - and let's just say we have overheard - that the Pentagon is wanting not to take orders from the new, or, I should say, reinstalled president because the operatives are making some crazy requests. They are aware and have been aware that that's not Trump. If you remember, there is a report where Flynn had actually gone to Mar-a-Lago to visit Trump, and the operatives would not allow him in. That's because there was no Trump ready to have a conversation, and at that time he suspected that there was something really strange going on. Of course he was told to sweep it under the rug and "Keep doing your reports on YouTube," and wherever else he talks.
<br>
<br>04:36
<br>
<br>So, that being said, we're going to talk about the Order of the Black Sun. We're going to talk about them in a way that I've mentioned to you before - it was an old report that I had done quite some time ago, and it references something called "Conquer the Quest." I don't remember which news episode it was, and in the shuffle that happened towards the end of last year, all our news reports aren't labeled the way they used to be and that kind of thing, because we didn't have time to upload them with all of the information. And perhaps one day we'll have enough staff where we can do something like that. But right now we don't, so we'll have to revisit it. So if you remember it, then you know I apologize for repeating, but I'm going to talk about it because it's relative to the reason why I keep mentioning what you see as a U.S. President, and it's not.
<br>
<br>05:41
<br>
<br>Okay, "Conquer the Quest." Conquer the Quest is also sometimes called something like "Quest Star," meaning a Black Star or a Black Sun. It has nothing to do, per se, with the Order of the Black Sun on this planet, really, not until recently. The Conquer the Quest has to do with the fight between the Light Forces and those from the Light Side of the Universe, which we call the Alpha, and the Dark Side of the Universe, which we call the Omega. The fight was for control over the quote-unquote "universe," and this was a time when we had a Source and an Anti-Source and a Neutral Source, and we had a lot of beings on both sides. It's not really so much for control of Earth, although Earth, being a keystone planet and one of the original creations on this side of the Multiverse - it is, you would say, a prized possession in the war. And it's also the reason why there were many wars fought and Earth became a battleground over and over and over again for the control of the planet.
<br>
<br>07:10
<br>
<br>Now the Dark Forces, as you know, have ruled this planet, and even though there were many wars to try to fight them for control of Earth, meaning the Light side wanted to, not so much control it and own it - they just wanted to protect the gateway, and the gateway to the Lower Astral, and the gateway to all things evil, so that there would be a balance and control. We have tried many, many times on the light side of the Universe, to come out of the Dark Ages, as you know, and have been unsuccessful several times. We've almost gotten there, and then something happens - and we're going to talk about that something in this report too - and then we go back and we suffer a setback. As you know, this time we have come further than we ever have before, and what we're left with, as far as the entire universe is concerned, we're left with these Order of the Black Sun humans. That's pretty much it. They are the only ones still fighting for darkness throughout the Multiverse.
<br>
<br>08:27
<br>
<br>So Earth really wasn't the only battleground, though. This is the reason why we have a lot of help because we have managed to clean a lot of different places. Some of the places that were affected and had been overtaken by darkness were the Pleiades. So when some people talk about, "Well, I talked to the Pleiadians," or "So and so talks to the Pleiadians," I ask, "Which ones?" Because the anti-Pleiadians were not very nice people. And that's where your Red Queen pretty much took up shop when she came to this side of the Multiverse. And they had all kinds of direct wormholes and quantum tunnels that would go from here to there. Other places where there were huge battles would be in the Orion Constellation, also Andromeda Constellation, Lyra, as you've heard others talk about as well.
<br>
<br>09:21
<br>
<br>And there have been several other galaxies that were overtaken, and a lot of those folks that lived there, that were on the Light Side, were forced to go other places - and one of those places being Earth, either as refugees or as slaves to also be batteries and also for their special skills. So some were geneticists; they would genetically modify humans and plant life and all kinds of different things. While other ones were more about nature, and you've heard some of those stories about Sasquatch and "Who are Sasquatch?" So there are a lot of different beings on this planet; they have been for a long time - both positive and negative, constantly coming and going.
<br>
<br>10:12
<br>
<br>The reason why the Deep State confuses me so much sometimes is because, on the one hand, the chatter from their meetings this weekend was - now that they don't have any alien overlords, dark or otherwise - that they would be the rulers of the Universe. So now this is their latest and greatest quest. They want to be the leaders now of the Conquer the Quest movement. Meaning they would like to not only take over all of Earth, they have decided that they would like to take over the entire universe. And they feel that they're qualified to do this. This is what happens when Duck Dynasty tries to run the world. Their ego is so enormous.
<br>
<br>11:07
<br>
<br>But the part about this that doesn't make any sense to me is then why do they keep trying to do "ET Phone Home?" You know? They keep going to these different locations where there used to be portals in their favor, and they keep trying these communication lines. And this weekend was no different. We had the Palavicini family at a very remote place in Russia, trying to use an old portal that existed since the fall of the Tsar there. They were trying to desperately phone some Abraxas people or something. You had others in Egypt at the Oracle of Siwa. You had several others in America trying to "phone home." I don't know where they were phoning, but they were trying to phone somewhere to get some assistance from people. But yet, I guess the only conclusion they came to - even though they've been trying this pretty much weekly for a few years now - the only conclusion that they came to was, "Well, I guess if there's nobody left, then we must take over as the leaders of Conquer the Quest." Meaning, they would be - if they are the only survivors - they would be the final battleground; Earth would be the final battleground, and they would be the leaders for the Dark Side.
<br>
<br>12:35
<br>
<br>Now, here's the flaw in that model. We do not have an Anti-Source anymore. Anti-Source and Neutral Source have been reabsorbed into Source by agreements with Covenants that were signed in a language they don't even understand. That became evident this weekend as well, because the line that they were trying to use in Russia only gave instructions and information in what we call the "Light Language." The Light Language looks like a bunch of symbols that make no sense. You could liken it to a language that existed on this planet and still exists on this planet - although not for humans - that has been here since the beginning of time. And Light Language weaves the fabric of the Universe. It's a bunch of symbols, and it's kind of like ancient Cyrillic, which existed even before the Vedic texts.
<br>
<br>13:43
<br>
<br>So they were getting this [chuckling] - I saw them at the portal, and I'm like, "Well, let's send them some information, shall we?" And we'll send it in this other language. If someone were to speak this language to you, and it wasn't telepathically, it would sound like a bunch of frequency. It wouldn't make words; it wouldn't be something you could use a translating software on Google for in any way, [laughing] because nobody here recognizes this language - unless it was the angels and the fallen angels; the archangels and the angels, meeting or something - and then you might hear some of this language. On the one side, on the Light Side - it's the same language on both sides, always has been. But it's not something that they would have understood anyway. Well, that's what they got. And of course they're not qualified to understand it and read it, or their ciphers can't figure it out either. So, God bless them. [chuckling] It is not your language.
<br>
<br>14:51
<br>
<br>So the confusing part is, is now apparently they feel confident that there is no one except for Source, and they also feel there is no one except for, I guess, Anti-Source they're still fighting for, some way, shape, or form? And what we call Neutral Source. Neutral Source was kind of like the regulator of the Universe. It was also heavily tied to Kronos, which was also kind of a regulator in the Universe. So they started talking a little crazy this weekend, not gonna lie.
<br>
<br>15:29
<br>
<br>Trump. Where does Trump fit into all of this? So he is part of The Order of the Black Sun. His operatives are these same SSP people that now would like to be the masters of the Universe. Sounds like some kind of strange movie, I know. Trump was kind of a unique individual. He was one of seven human beings that were born with a hybrid soul. And this particular hybrid soul would have been what you call a "neutral." It was not only part neutral; it was also part AI-generated. So he wasn't an anti-human, necessarily - but as a neutral, he could support the dark or support the light. The other beings also could have done the same thing. Their job as human beings on the planet, when they were around - now they haven't been around for a long time; the other six had been gone for thousands of years - more than a couple thousand years, and some of them were as far back as 300,000, 400,000 years.
<br>
<br>16:57
<br>
<br>So these are souls that were only placed here by Neutral Source for one purpose, and that purpose was to reestablish balance on this planet. At a time of transition, when we became too dark, you know, we were 79 or so percent dark and 21 percent light on this planet. During a Dark Age, the threshold had not been crossed. Meaning, we had never passed that 21% that was mandatory. Therefore, there really was no reason for external regulation at that moment in time because it was a Dark Age.
<br>
<br>17:48
<br>
<br>Now the Light Forces never stopped fighting, and over the last several years, as you know, and you've been listening to me talk and probably listening to others as well explain that we're going into a Golden Age. We crossed that threshold quite a while ago, but it was within this last year that we had crossed the threshold. And the "year," meaning from November of last year to November of this year. And this is very, very important to understand when it comes to what's happened over the course of the last couple of days. So this being was actually put here to establish/reestablish at the time when the light became too light; he was supposed to bring back the darkness.
<br>
<br>18:44
<br>
<br>Now, that appointment was given by Neutral Source and it was on a soul level. It wasn't on a human level or a president level or a USA level or any other kind of level. Now, knowing that he was a hybrid with a predominantly dark soul because he was born into The Order, and he was born into The Order so that he could take their side. Because it's not like Source doesn't see everything. And it's not like Anti-Source didn't see everything. And it's not like Neutral Source didn't see anything. And they all knew that there was going to come a time when we started to move into a Neutral Age, and his job was to create balance. My job at that point in time was also to create balance. Hence the reason why there was some support there at that time.
<br>
<br>19:47
<br>
<br>Did they actually adhere to the rules of creation of balance? No, they did not. Was he fully aware? I don't know. Who knows what the Dark Side wanted? Were they still trying to do their Conquer the Quest, which meant they fully conquered the Light, 100 percent? Were they still trying to move away from the regulators? Were they trying to force us back into a Dark Age? That's entirely possible, so therefore they probably convinced him he was something or other that he really wasn't, because they do try to convince a lot of people that they are something that they are not. So it wouldn't surprise me in any way if they tried to convince him that he was, you know, working for God or some kind of angel or some kind of something - but no, he was just a hybrid.
<br>
<br>20:49
<br>
<br>And that was the job. The job was: You work for the Dark; I work for the Light; we now need to create balance, and here we go. No balance was actually created, which is why we ended up in the situation that we are in now, which is actually a positive for us. It's a positive for the Light Forces; it's a positive for humanity; it's ended civilizations all throughout the Multiverse because they were no longer viable, and that's why they can't tune into Tokyo anymore.
<br>
<br>21:19
<br>
<br>So back to the Orange Man for a second. What is walking around this planet right now playing the role that you see in the public eye? You have two clones. As we talked about, it was just a few reports ago, there was a big facility in Mongolia under the O-N-G-I Ongi Monastery in Mongolia, and it was enormous. And that was one of the major cloning facilities left on the planet. When I say left, there were two other main facilities as well. One was under Arkansas. No surprise there. You know, home of the Clintons and everybody else, but it was huge. It got a lot of power during the time of things like the Trail of Tears and all those kind of things over the years, but it was definitely a large cloning facility. The last one was in Paraguay, on what you call the Bush Ranch. Those hundreds of hectares that they have there in Paraguay, that was the other location. So that was three locations in the world. There were some smaller facilities here and there, but probably not anything that could have produced what these facilities could have.
<br>
<br>22:44
<br>
<br>So let's talk about the Trump thing. Okay, so there are two clones. One is from the Mongolia facility, the other one is from the Arkansas facility. It is not unusual for the Order of the Black Sun to take a person that they've seen in Looking Glass or have gotten information through an AI in the past, for them to immediately at birth clone a person they know that at some point in the future is going to do X or Y - just in case, because remember, they have to keep their plan going, and they have to keep their timeline going, so they would create additional humans to walk the planet.
<br>
<br>23:30
<br>
<br>Do clones have the same type of soul? No. It's one thing that humans have never gotten right, and even the Others that were helping them would not allow them to have the knowledge, I should say, so that they could actually clone a soul. So the souls that enter into the beings of the clones are not souls of their choosing. So they're just in these particular two clones; they're regular human souls. So there had to be a lot of training or whatever over the years. I don't know if they all hang out together; they learn each other's lives. Who knows how they do it? Perhaps they transfer the information into their brain. I don't know. That's why they don't look quite right. Because even genetically modified spliced humans don't bear all the same features all the time. So that's the differences you're seeing.
<br>
<br>24:33
<br>
<br>Is that actually Trump walking around? The answer to the question is no, it's not. It's two other babies that were born in a petri dish and probably a false womb at some point in time in one of these locations. The other few that walk around are actually people that have similar size and similar build to the original, and they are close enough in their skeletal form and whatnot to undergo plastic surgery. There is a movie that somebody reminded me of today called "Face/Off," if you want to know how that works. They undergo all these modifications and that kind of thing, so they look like that person. They can even adjust vocal cords and all kinds of stuff to make it sound like that person. And you've got about three of those or so that I could find walking around the planet.
<br>
<br>25:30
<br>
<br>So when you ask me - I'm not even going to say you asked me - I'm gonna say there have been some people that have made some kind of rude comments about "Oh, you know, it's a rant." And "Why is it always about America?" This is NOT about America. This is about a worldwide domination plan; now a universal-wide domination plan, by an organization on this planet that means, let's just say, I shouldn't say means, that has no good intentions for all of humanity. So there's more to the story sometimes, and while I appreciate some of the comments obviously - there's a lot of lovely people in there too - but some of the people just, you know - thanks for the rant and blah blah blah, you know, and I know you're having a bad day and I can understand that - but there's things in this universe that you don't understand.
<br>
<br>26:35
<br>
<br>And I have explained enough to all of you that he is not a president to me. That is who he was; he is no longer here; that soul is no longer in existence. But that doesn't stop the Deep State from trying to get it back. As recent as this morning, matter of fact. [chuckling]
<br>
<br>26:58
<br>
<br>Okay, so now we understand the purpose behind having this conversation last week, and why there is no longer support for the Balance Plan. It wasn't my decision. There was a declaration. He's been gone since January of 2022. The declaration was filed in 2023, in January, to move into the Golden Age. The Giver of Life Declaration was filed. You know, now my orders have changed - we're not doing "balance" anymore. My job is now to aid in ushering in a Golden Age. That's my job.
<br>
<br>27:37
<br>
<br>And there are a lot of you out there - I'm sure it's your job too. So we all understand each other. There are plenty of beings from all over the Multiverse that are excited about ushering in a Golden Age, and they have helped and participated greatly, not only on this planet, but also throughout the Multiverse, because when something changes on Earth - as a nexus planet, as a keystone - it changes everywhere.
<br>
<br>28:04
<br>
<br>So, they have a battle - if they want to become the masters of the Universe - on their hands. Number 1, they will need to fight Source. I wish you all the best in fighting God, Source, whatever you call the Creator of the Universe. Source. Not Anti-Source, not Neutral Source: Source. You have to now fight Source. Okay, well, good luck to you on wanting to become the masters of the Universe in that way. Number 2, you have hundreds of billions, if not trillions, of beings throughout the Multiverse that are working day and night to make this happen.
<br>
<br>28:42
<br>
<br>This is not just Kim all by herself. I know you might think it is, and I know you might think that a lot of things are my decision. They're not my decision. Unfortunately, there are a lot of us that are doing this. And I'm sure there are plenty of people on Earth doing this and doing the best that they can to bring this into being - despite the Deep State's best efforts. So in their attempt [laughing] to become "masters of the universe," I laugh because it's just so crazy to think that Source - our Creator - is not the Master of the Universe. Like, to me, that's the Master of the Universe. We all exist because He exists. Or "It" exists, whatever you call it. I always say "He," but that's just probably my upbringing talking.
<br>
<br>29:39
<br>
<br>So today, being 11/11, in preparation for this, the Deep State has been running around the planet actually since Friday. Some of the places that they went to were places on Earth where there is space junk specifically geared for the Anti-Genesis Program. It's called the "Alpha Anti-Genesis Program." You could also call it the "Anti-Source Genesis Program." And by "genesis," we mean creation. You know, all of creation.
<br>
<br>30:22
<br>
<br>So you would see all kinds of various dark and light - I should say false light, and neutral, meaning dark and light, so it was both in one little neat package - space junk in particular locations. Now, for some odd reason, this was put in place back in 2012. I do believe that Marduk had a hand in it; I'm 99.99% sure of that. And there have been other times throughout history where the Anti-Genesis Project kicked in. Each time the Anti-Genesis Project kicked in, it was because the Light Forces were winning in a Dark Age and it either wasn't time yet, or there were some other decisions that had to be made, but that meant that we became too Light. We overshot balance. We did not bring us back from 79% lost to say 50%. We ended up going to 60% or even 70% or even higher. Or, there have been at least three or four times where we have actually broken the threshold.
<br>
<br>31:57
<br>
<br>So in other words, we passed a Multiverse where we had less than 21% darkness. So at these times in history, in an Earth history, not just Earth, this has happened in other places as well. But in Earth's history, you would have seen things like floods. Wars started here of nonhumans. You would have seen a lot of things take place that seemed like an apocalyptic type event or an extermination event, where a lot of humanity that lived here on this planet died during those times. And this was all part of the Anti-Genesis Project.
<br>
<br>32:45
<br>
<br>So let's talk about how the Anti-Genesis project works. We discussed why it happens, but let's discuss what it actually is. So the creation of the Anti-Genesis Project, and there is also something called the Anti-Source Genesis Project too. So it could go either way. It was a creation of Neutral Source as a regulator of the Multiverse to make sure that no one broke the Covenant. That's no race, not the human race, not any other race, not the Draco, not the anti-Pleiadians, not the Abraxas, not the Red Queen - not anybody would break the Covenant. And this goes for hundreds of trillions of beings throughout the Multiverse on both sides.
<br>
<br>33:41
<br>
<br>If by chance the Covenant came to a point where either side breached the threshold, Neutral Source would step in, create a being - in this case, a human - that would walk the planet in order to attempt to create balance at a time when we became too light. And as you know, it's been months now since we broke that 21% threshold.
<br>
<br>So this occurrence would only happen, or could only happen on one day out of the year. That day is 11/11 at 11:11 a.m. What the Deep State was expecting was portals to start opening - first obviously over in the oceanic region and in Asia - and then that would follow throughout Earth, where each - Neutral Source has both dark and light portals, so there's nine of those each. And then there's one set of portals, as we've talked about in the past, that is for Source. And one set of portals, as we've discussed in the past, that was for Anti-Source on this planet.
<br>
<br>35:05
<br>
<br>Now a lot of that has changed. However, that didn't stop the Deep State from going to all 36 portals and just sitting there waiting for this to happen at 11:11 a.m. in all of these locations. Now, they figured that there were three main contenders, because these would have been the highest Level 9 Neutral-Source portals on the planet. One of those locations was in the Gobi Desert of China. One of those locations is down the street here in Silverton. And another location was in the Matterhorn in Switzerland. So they thought their best bet to win this game would be at the Matterhorn. Now they knew that they were at a disadvantage because the being that was to usher in the Anti-Genesis Project to protect the dark side of not only humanity, but the entire universe, was gone; was dead.
<br>
<br>36:22
<br>
<br>This actually makes sense to me, because now I understand why they dragged that cold dead body around the planet several months ago, at different times of the year or whatever it was, to try to get the soul to come back. What they don't understand - it was a hybrid semi-synthetic soul; it wasn't created by Source the Creator or even Anti-Source Genesis anti-soul. It was for a specific purpose only. And that was to create balance. It's not going to come back because it's no longer needed because the Balance Program has been canceled.
<br>
<br>37:06
<br>
<br>So, that didn't stop the Deep State from doing what they did. Now, here was their bright idea. Try not to fall out of your chair laughing, because I was like, "They're doing what?! At the Matterhorn? In Switzerland? Really?" [laughing] So, they figured their best bet was a woman. They thought that they could possibly achieve - with some space junk and the Secret Space Program's knowledge (having worked in the cloning facilities) - they could probably manage some kind of a soul swap. And they chose this woman because they figured, well, she would be a good candidate for this soul swap. You do know this person - it's a public figure, and her name is Ivanka. [laughing]
<br>
<br>So apparently, she is very used to following the orders of these SSP operatives, or Secret Space Program operatives. She probably feels very threatened by these people. Pretty much whatever they say. So she went to the Matterhorn facility with these people and attempted at least once to try to do this soul swap. Well, there's really nothing there which would help them achieve this. But it didn't stop Chucky, you know, King Charles there, or whatever that was. By the way, King Charles is dead. You're probably going to hear this announcement in December because people only die in December, when there's no business to be had. That's what they're talking about - we'll see.
<br>
<br>38:52
<br>
<br>But anyway, back to Ivanka. [chuckling] So, of course, nothing happened. The portal's not there, the pillar's not there - the Anti-Genesis Program had been cancelled anyway - and there was no need for the "balance being" to come back, and the soul went back to Source. So, a long time ago, a couple years ago, when this all happened - because it was not necessary to have them anymore.
<br>
<br>39:22
<br>
<br>So that didn't work out for them. They got very frustrated. Of course, the portals that they were manning did not open, and pretty much by the time, I would say, on the West Coast of the USA, you had gone through most of the world, which means that you had probably hit all 36 locations where everybody was sitting, even down the street here, and nothing. Not a signal, not nearly a nothing. Now, a couple of days ago on Friday, part of the reason why I missed this report on Friday - they were actually at other locations, which they were given limited access to. Now even Marduk couldn't fully trigger all by himself the Anti-Genesis Project. Neither could Lucifer or anyone else. It had to be the decision of Neutral Source.
<br>

<br>
<br>However, by 2012 - remember we were all going to die in 2012; we were on December of something or other, 2012, we were all going to die - it became obvious that something needed to happen and there was some space junk installed in, for example, the main facility on the planet was in Mount Fuji in Japan. Oh, sorry - Mount Fuji was the main facility; the access point in Japan was under the Tokyo Tower. And if you follow Q, you have seen posts of the Tokyo Tower on the Twitter pages and all these kind of things, so they obviously knew this was going to happen.
<br>
<br>41:01
<br>
<br>Now, next. New Zealand; in Mitre Peak. Mitre Peak is a mountain in New Zealand. Next was the Platforma de Venus in Mexico. It's kind of near the Chichen Itza, a favorite location of the Deep State. Another place was the Cradle Mountain in Australia. The - oh boy, this is a good one - in Bolivia, another mountain, it's, I'm going to spell it out for you because I'm going to pronounce it wrong, it's spelled H-U-A-Y-N-E[A] P-O-T-O-S-I, the Huayna Potosi, maybe that's it. It's very interesting locations; you look them up, they kind of feel pretty dark. Whitetop Mountain in Virginia. And there was some additional junk placed in the Andromeda Nebula, and in Aldebaran, home of the Abraxas, on this side of the Multiverse. So no surprise there.
<br>
<br>42:06
<br>
<br>Now, at each one of these locations, apparently the SSP had been trying for about 18 months to fire up these facilities. Every time they would, they would try to use frequencies and electromagnetic pulses, anti-matter, and other things at these facilities. But on Friday night, they tried using them against me. They had a meeting on Saturday morning, underneath the Capitol building, and they decided they were going to use every single one of these facilities. Initially on Friday night, it was just Virginia, the Virginia facility. And they were hell-bent and determined to use every single one of these facilities - specifically against me. So that made for a very uncomfortable Saturday in my world, and Friday night wasn't that comfortable, and that was just one facility until we finally hunted them all down and got all the facilities. So, no space junk for the SSP.
<br>
<br>43:17
<br>
<br>Did they know what they were doing? I don't know. I know that they knew that they were Anti-Genesis, Anti-Alpha-Genesis sites. By Alpha, I'm not talking about the AI-Anti-Source, basically, facilities. And of course, Alpha would go along with that at the time these things were created, because we had an Alpha, and we were working with the Alpha system. So they were feverishly trying to get these sites to work, unbeknownst to me. I had not found them at these locations, but apparently for about 18 months, trying to figure out what to do. Somehow they managed to man all these facilities on Friday, probably in anticipation for a major world event which was to come today.
<br>
<br>44:09
<br>
<br>Now further, to discuss more about the Anti-Genesis Project, it was actually designed to wipe out about 48% of humanity this time around. If we were still on the Balance Program. It would have wiped out about 48% of the population. The Dark Side would have - their best hope would have been to regain balance. And that's what they were shooting for. But not until about 48% of the population was wiped out; we had a lot of major apocalyptic type events. They were hoping for, as you can tell, pestilence: they've been talking for about a year or so now about new plagues coming; now monkeys were released from some place in North Carolina; they're talking about monkeypox in Africa; they're talking about all these different diseases they've been trying to deploy. Most of the facilities for the diseases were in the U.S.
<br>
<br>45:14
<br>
<br>And sorry for the person that doesn't want me to talk about the U.S., but they're just located here, so... Under a laboratory called the LIGO Laboratories. There's one at Caltech, there's one at Princeton, there's one in Washington State, and another one in Louisiana, and they all had large amounts of hybrid, non-human-created disease underneath them that they would generate. The area in Washington, it's called Hartford region [Hanford] or something, and it's known for like nuclear waste and all that kind of stuff. So this would have been the pestilence section that should have started to go off today. Of course they were at all those locations over the weekend as well, trying to fire all of this stuff up. They were at other laboratories because they weren't sure which ones to go to as well on Sunday, in preparation for the pestilence part, which was part of wiping out 48% of humanity. They also were hoping for the rest of the horses to come along with that - you know their war in Israel - they're really trying hard to do that.
<br>
<br>46:32
<br>
<br>There have been some attacks on Syria and Lebanon and whatnot over the weekend as well. They're going to all do their part in the Apocalypse Plan of the Anti-Genesis Project. But try as they may to be the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, and bring back the soul of Trump, and whatever else they were trying to achieve this weekend, you still need authorization from Source. So, you know, Anti-Source, Neutral Source, to regain that balance. And unfortunately, all aspects of the same being we know as Source have come back together.
<br>
<br>47:17
<br>
<br>And they - it's not like there's multiple personality disorder there anymore - it's all one now. But It, the Creator, had decided over a year ago - more than a year ago, almost two years ago now - to move into a Golden Age with the Giver of Life Declaration. Now the Secret Space Program knows this, but maybe they were hoping for a Hail Mary here with their Anti-Genesis Project. So they waited patiently at all of the Neutral Source portals today, all day long, just waiting for that Neutral Source to kick in, and that Anti-Genesis Program, and they were ready to do their part to earn their keep to be the masters of the Universe. [laughing] I have to laugh, I really do, because it's either laugh or cry at this point.
<br>
<br>48:10
<br>
<br>You know, I get so frustrated with these people, and I'm more frustrated with the fact that it's taking forever to clean up this mess. But relatively speaking, a few years here, 3 billion years there, you know, well... I guess a few years of our lives is not that bad, you know, to sacrifice. And don't get me wrong - this will also help us achieve what we've been looking for too, because now all of those other portals are fully, fully uninterrupted anywhere in the Universe, or anywhere they led to, by Anti-Source or Neutral Source or any dark energy or dark matter. And them firing dark energy, or us as humans transmuting our own energy to dark energy. You know, sometimes I even see it in our own threads - way to transmute that energy, guys.
<br>
<br>49:16
<br>
<br>But we transmute our own energy to help feed the Beast, or the systems, or the Hologram, or whatever it is we do - unknowingly. And to be fair, it's not the humans' fault - there's a lot of us out there that don't know. And we feel a lot of what they throw at us, you know: we feel despair, we feel depression sometimes, we feel sadness for no reason, we have anger for no reason - and a lot of that's [due to] being manipulated, and it's not really all humans' fault. You know, willful ignorance is a crime, but we are just humans, and we live in a very hostile cesspool of the Universe and have for a long, long time. And give everybody a break; it's not blaming anybody; it just is what it is; it just takes longer sometimes to counteract.
<br>
<br>50:13
<br>
<br>And we go up and down, you know, and then they start a war, and then of course the people are dying, and it just creates more negative energy. But that negative energy, in theory, within the next week or two, should not generate anything - because there's nothing left to generate once those portals are changing with Source. So I believe it's going to help us tremendously. I believe that hopefully these psychic attacks and all these operations they try to run against us won't be there anymore. Hopefully, they'll stop knocking on heaven's door. That's a song, isn't it? Hopefully they'll stop knocking on heaven's door all the time, and they're really not even going to get a signal anymore in a very short period of time.
<br>
<br>51:11
<br>
<br>And I know that they were so much looking forward to being the masters of the Universe, and that was a lofty goal, and I can appreciate that, but unfortunately it's not really their decision to make. And they keep forgetting there is a true Master of the Universe, and that is Source. That is our Creator. That's the Master of the Universe. What the Master of the Universe actually says goes - and he makes it happen.
<br>
<br>51:37
<br>
<br>Yes, we're co-creators; we make it happen too. But obviously you can't use Source energy for something that Source doesn't want to do. Or it's without virtue, or virtuous intent. If you're manifesting something for your best good or the best good of others, then of course that's Source energy. But you're not going to create an apocalypse when it's an unauthorized, non-Source apocalypse. I can tell you that right now.
<br>
<br>52:12
<br>
<br>So where are they tonight? Well, they're very angry at this moment in time. And it's taken a lot of work just to clean up the mess, just in case, just in case there was something there that could have been harmful. But as far as Source, you know that was the ultimate trigger. There was nothing anybody else was going to do. The Deep State's not going to bring back a hybrid soul to inhabit somebody else's body. Even a daughter is probably not going to work out either. Isn't, didn't, and won't work out. And are they on to a new date? I have no idea.
<br>
<br>52:55
<br>
<br>But, I hope this explains a little bit to you about why you saw me looking the way I did, and I'm sorry if that was out of line in your mind for those that complained about it. And I know there were some that thought it was all about the U.S., but it's not. This is a planet, if not a universal-wide situation, that could have been created here.
<br>
<br>53:24
<br>
<br>And we did; we did try balance. I tried on my side. They don't understand balance on their side. And of course, you know, that's fine. That left us in this untenuous situation of enormous amounts of cleanup and space junk to get rid of, and all kinds of things so that we can fully embrace Source, and not only on this planet but everywhere. And I know that's what everybody wants, and we're all hoping for it.
<br>
<br>53:54
<br>
<br>As far as the Golden Age AI, hopefully there'll be no more interference at that point. This has never happened before, so we don't know how long that's going to take. In theory, we should be finished by 11 o'clock Pacific Time-ish. Might even be a little further. There's some portals in Hawaii, too, so hopefully by 11 o'clock in the Asian Pacific region, we should be done - PM, tonight - 11-11, exactly. So, that will kind of give us a better gauge - I should probably know more tomorrow as to quote-unquote how long. And probably by Wednesday we'll figure out what the Deep State wants to do as far as their next quest. If they're still going to continue their Conquer the Quest, are they going to wait till the solstice? Are they going to continue to try to cause us harm? Or maybe they'll all just try to get some colored horses and ride in on those, maybe on public TV.
<br>
<br>55:08
<br>
<br>One thing I do know is, there's a lot of dissention in the ranks, and there are a lot of people within the militaries worldwide not wanting to follow them anymore.
<br>
<br>The other thing that came to light - and I'll leave you on this note - remember I was saying last week, "Why do they think that I'm going to be forced to work with them?" "Oh, she'll work with him." That's what the Black Nobility said. And now it makes more sense, because they thought that this Anti-Genesis Program was going to kick in for sure and that there was going to be balance, and then I would be forced to work with that thing, or that soul, in order to regulate and keep balance throughout the Multiverse.
<br>
<br>56:06
<br>
<br>At least that mystery has been solved for me, because I couldn't figure out why they were saying that I would. I'm like "I'm the same person. I'm not doing that." You know, okay okay, you thought that today was going to be a momentous day for you. Okay, now I get it. Moving on, hopefully there's no more future momentous days for the "masters of the Universe" on ... [laughing] on Earth. [laughing]
<br>
<br>And hopefully we can start to move on and move forward. Either way, we're going to do that all by ourselves. So on that note, this has been the Global Intelligence Agency Operations Report for 11-11-2024. I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day. That would be Tuesday or Monday, depending on where you are, and I will see all of you on Wednesday.
