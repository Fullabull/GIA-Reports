World Situation Report
<br>2023-Nov-03 News</h2>

<!-- TEASER:-->

<h3>And now, the World Situation Report, with Kimberly Goguen from the Office of the Guardian. The Deep State loves their stolen artifacts, but do they know what they do? And can they use them? There are just some technologies in this world that will not work for the wrong people. Is the military really saving us all, as the alternative media portrays? Find out what they've been up to and who they are listening to, and why. And we'll answer three of your video questions as we connect with Kim.</h3>

<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Now here's Kimberly Goguen with the Office of the Guardian. Hello, Kim. How are you?
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Hello, Miss Sunny. How are you today? Happy Friday.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Happy Friday. We made it to the end of the week!
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>It's not the end of any of my week. I know that, but we got a few things I want to talk about today, and then I'll give you a little update on what's going on with the alleged Langley meeting. Okay. Yawn.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Yeah. Exactly. Okay.
<br>
<br>00:46:05
<br>
<br>Kim: Alright. Let's start with the banking issue. Right. So, a long time ago, like during the Trump administration, they had installed closed loops that were just simply called Q. Yes, so yes, they did. And this was in the Omega system at the time. And there's still some remnants of that, but it doesn't actually synchronize into the banking system. So here was the plan. They are going to hold up your deposits. They are going to take them out of the banking system; this is what they forget, utilizing a synchronizing terrestrial integrated chromomorphic, oh yes, kernel, also called a STICK.
<br>
<br>Sunny: A stick!
<br>
<br>Kim: Yes. So it's, in technical terms, I'll repeat it one more time, it's a synchronizing terrestrial - because remember we're talking about quantum AI here - integrated chromomorphic kernel. Which they had intended to attach to this closed loop, which existed in some remnant form in, I guess you would say in Omega, for lack of a better term. Now had they done this and taken all your deposits - they started doing it about 24, 48 hours ago, testing it at least - and had they done this, they would have figured out you can't put it back in because it's still taking it out of the banking system.
<br>
<br>00:47:41
<br>
<br>But then again, I am not crediting these people. Some of them just can't get away from the fact that everything has changed. They just can't do it. They also still tried to install Trump Bucks yesterday for the 1764th time. So, yeah. But this glitch should be fixed within the next, you know, by the time the end of this broadcast anyway. Because it's already started. And they don't have any more kernels, and they don't have any more fake Q things on the other side. And all of their random access memory and a bunch of other things are going away as well. So it's just like I said, it's a shadow. It's not really connected to anything. It exists in other densities and other dimensions that are not in our reality that we live in now. So, it doesn't stop them from trying because they use these machines; they try to find things, and then they're like, "Oh God, we found it. Oh, thank God for the Q line that exists in the depths of Hell. Let's save the world, guys, with the Q line from the depths of Hell."
<br>
<br>If you'd like to have a demonic cursed wine with whatever the heck that is and running your banking system, then you can probably sign up on some Q telegram chat somewhere.
<br>
<br>00:49:04
<br>
<br>Sunny: I was just going to say, is there a connection between that and Q as we know it, the White Hat Q?
<br>
<br>Kim: Yep. That's actually, yes. Yes, saving the world one demon at a time. Saving whose world? I'm not sure.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Wow.
<br>
<br>Kim: They also tried to submit several agreements to me through the Treasury Department. Oh gosh, that was 24 hours ago. So, they'd like to restore the Republic. They'd like to do that with $7.6 trillion. I know, right? And I'm like, $7.6 trillion is not going to get the United States government out of anything. It might last you to the end of November. You're in so much trouble right now; you have no idea. And that's how - when I started getting these things in rapid succession - I started to realize; I felt like I'm talking to these Trump people on the Internet. I'm like, who are these people? So we called the Treasury Department, and I said, "What Yahoo took over your terminal? Who did you let take over your terminal? Who are these people?" And there are operatives that didn't really understand what's going on here. Remember, Trump's saving everybody here, from beyond the grave. For some of these guys, they've not been told the truth, so they're learning, and they learned yesterday.
<br>
<br>Langley, on the other hand, would like an "Interim Security of the Planet Earth" contract. I got that one this morning. I did like it - a 90-day contract and 17 trillion dollars to do it with. That is also a "no" from me.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Yeah, what were they planning to do with it? Any idea? Like, what's the plan?
<br>
<br>Kim: Well, today's another one of those days ending in Y. It's Friday, and they promised everybody money. And I'm going to go into a lot of detail about what's happening in the Middle East. And they are writing checks that their backside cannot cash rapidly right now. And digging themselves further and further and further into the hole.
<br>
<br>00:51:24
<br>
<br>So, now let's talk about a little bit about operatives and like what's kind of going on as this thing. You know it's kind of... you're watching a movie here. It's constantly changing and constantly morphing. So I mentioned to you on Wednesday that Langley supposedly wants to come forward and be good friends. Remember, they want to work together, want to have a meeting. That's absolutely not the case.
<br>
<br>00:51:51
<br>
<br>Now, the reason why they said this, and I suspected this from the get-go. I did not leave the light on. I did not put my best suit on today. I did not do it; I wasn't expecting anything, I gotta be honest with you. So I said, "Call me when you show up." That's what I said. "When you're here in Durango, then call me and I'll come down the street and we'll have a talk." Right? Well, yeah. I would hate to be an operative. I just wouldn't tell you that much because you're really stuck between a rock and a hard place, and then of course you don't really; you can't really trust those around you either. So they've kind of developed this "if one's going to go, we're all going to go" kind of mentality. So they were told - remember I said that they told/asked me to give them 24 hours and we were going to see their work. All the great things they're going to do. "Just give us 24 hours," and all of this stuff. Well, the story behind 24 hours has to do with stolen artifacts.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Okay.
<br>
<br>00:53:01
<br>
<br>Kim: So there were these two artifacts. They're very small. They look almost like a fatter version of a coin, but a large coin. They're not very big. Now, they had stolen them many, many years ago from our side. And there are more than seven in the world. I'll just leave it at that. I know that for a fact. And they thought on this particular day - based on the last line of instructions they ever got from the Underworld - that last night any time after midnight would be a good time to then take these coins, which they thought opened gates. That was their impression.
<br>
<br>Again, we're in the car trying to wait for our dishes to be cleaned in the back seat. So they were under the impression that these opened gateways and there was some kind of something that was supposed to occur last night, according to their old instruction set. So they went to the Rothschilds, actually, because they believed themselves to be the Line of Solomon, the Khazarians. Some other Family members from Saudi Arabia went to the gate in Israel with these two coins and made an attempt to open the gate there.
<br>
<br>00:54:37
<br>
<br>Now, they got very frustrated when it didn't work. Of course they did. So they wanted to see what was inside the coins that made this happen. So they broke the coins open. This was probably about two o'clock in the morning my time, thank you very much. No one ever does anything in daylight hours, you know that? My alarms start going off. I'm like, "What the heck are you people doing now? And you gotta wake me up at two." I mean, that's fine; I'm used to like zero sleep, so that's fine. So they got very frustrated. So they broke open these two; for lack of a better term, I'm calling them coins. They're probably the thickness of an average pancake, maybe a few millimeters thick. They're probably about the size of a... maybe a little smaller than your average cheeseburger or something like that, you know, kind of in round, so they're a little larger than a coin.
<br>
<br>00:55:33
<br>
<br>And they broke them open, and what they saw was a type of a computer chip. And they saw some crystal dust, or type of sand, I would say, because there were some pieces that were larger, some pieces that were smaller, but it was filled with a bunch of crystals. So they got very angry, and they took these then broken coins, I guess for lack of a better term - they only had two - and they tried to read the chip that was inside. So they took it to, let's just say, special Israeli people that specialize in cyber things, and managed to read a part of what was in there. So you could say that this was almost like a flash drive, for lack of a better term.
<br>
<br>00:56:29
<br>
<br>It had some information on it. But they read a little bit about the - on the preface, like, let's just say a book has a preface; it gives you kind of like a little bit of a summary of the plot to the story and whatnot. So they basically had realized, number 1, that these were something that could have been utilized during the beginning of the Light Age. Now that we have transitioned into the Light Age, you no longer matter. No, they got really angry. They were actually tied to something else, which they did not possess, which was supposed to go to the same place on the border of Iran and Iraq, where the living water is.
<br>
<br>00:57:27
<br>
<br>You remember the gates opening and all of that, and that special place and the mound of gold. And there was another artifact that they're missing, that they do not have. I know they do not have it, because I know where it is, and I know where I left it. And that's not where I left it. I actually physically carried this object to a location, and it is now hidden there, for a long time because it's not a toy. And then there are a few other coins that were to go along with it, which would go to different continents, which would then activate a, let's just say something. But it cannot be used for the reverse. You cannot reverse it out.
<br>
<br>00:58:09
<br>
<br>So the rest of everything was written in one of the oldest languages in the Universe, and I've seen some of those agreements between Source and Source and all of this, but it can be translated by a person with the right frequency. So I have also seen this same language in the books of Natural Law and a few other things. And it's very easy to decipher and to read if you know how to do it, and you are on the Light Side and you work with light matter and you work with a lot of different other things, you can read it. So, if you're listening and you're with the Rothschild family and you need somebody to translate this for you, come on down to Durango. I'd be happy to do that and take care of that for you, no problem.
<br>
<br>But you're not going to like the answer.
<br>
<br>00:58:54
<br>
<br>Sunny: What did it say?
<br>
<br>Kim: Well, it's all about the restoration of nature, all things natural, the natural order of things. It's like the recipe on how to fix things based on its attachment to Earth's Akashic records, the original DNA blueprints, and those types of things. So it's basically a recipe for restoration, for lack of a better term. And then it would've programmed that into the DNA of Earth, and the DNA of Earth would've changed quicker.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Can you tell me why they hide these in different things? You were calling them coins, but they're really artifacts. Is it just to hide it? I mean to hide a computer chip or whatever just to make it kind of blend in with other stuff, or what's the point behind that?
<br>
<br>00:59:47
<br>
<br>Kim: Well, we've talked about the cryptex they had; we've talked about a lot of other things. Now, in my conversation with the possible meeting that was supposed to happen, potentially with Langley 5, right? They asked if I needed them to bring the STICK. And I'm like, "Okay, for what? What are you bringing me?" And in my personal opinion, and I have seen this over and over again. Now, I personally have never done this. So I've never been one to... I have met Parents, I've met; obviously I've met Marduk, and I've met Enki and Enlil and some of those folks. I've met some Parents, I have met one or two Coven Masters and all these things. And they love their symbology of things, you know, "Kiss my ring." You know I'm more of a kiss-my-doot person myself. But they do these, like, symbol things, and they bring them things, and it's just some egotistical, elitist attitude, kind of weird stuff, you know?
<br>
<br>Sunny: Yeah.
<br>
<br>01:01:06
<br>
<br>Kim: So, I have no idea why they do that. I know we did that, and we put a lot of stuff in different locations over the many years of doing this. Some of us have done this a lot. And we do things in such a way that it can only be utilized by us in many ways, at least to its fullest degree. They are helpful little tools that we deposit in different places, and they love to steal our stuff. Bottom line.
<br>
<br>01:01:44
<br>
<br>We also have other things called the Java Suns. The Java Suns look like crystal balls with like a gold trim around it. It sort of looks like a bunch of curly sun rays coming off of it. That's one thing we have. We have a lot of stuff that they've stolen over the years, and they can't manage to make them work, and they get frustrated. They're angry. They're supposed to be God's chosen people in their minds. It just happens to be the Anti-Source and you chose a side a long time ago. Your ancestors chose a side a long time ago, and you can't go back from that.
<br>
<br>01:02:22
<br>
<br>So, this leads me to why Langley 5 put off the meeting. So they thought that they were going to be successful last night. Of course, true to form, the Rothschild family never tells the truth about anything, whatever is left of them now. And of course they lied, and they said, "Give it a few hours to work; we did the thing; it's going to happen," which was all a flat-out lie. I would hate to be a member of The Order because all they do is lie and cheat and steal from each other constantly.
<br>
<br>You know, I'm out. I would have done bad things to these people a long time ago if I - because you don't have any rules on their side - we're for the protection of our lives or the lives of innocents and so on and so forth. So, then Langley 5 has to buy time. Right, so now we're going down the food chain here. Langley 5 now has to buy time with everyone. And so they called the Treasury, and they said, "Give us a day or so; we're going to work this whole thing out." Meanwhile, they're hacking like crazy, like I just told you - hence the reason for the delay in deposits that was announced. And they're trying to get money in any which way they can. I don't think that they realize how much money is actually in circulation right now.
<br>
<br>01:03:40
<br>
<br>And how their repeated attempts at stealing it, taking it to remote servers, and everything over the last 10, 15 years has really drained the liquidity from the banking system. Because nobody's here putting any back in anymore. And the only gasp of air they've gotten in 10 years is from me. So now this has led to a very angry group of operatives. We are down to about 1% believers. And that is as of this morning. So we went from 30% down to about 1% still believing. Now Langley 5 is going crazy because a lot of their operatives are not even picking up their phone call anymore. You know, they gave the 1%ers 24 hours and basically told them, "Look, you're either for us and with us or you're against us." And you can imagine what that means in their world. You can take it from there.
<br>
<br>01:04:46
<br>
<br>That would bring us to tomorrow morning. So they are going to go forward no matter what. You know, They're tired, everything is breaking down, they're going around and around in a circle with these people, waiting for some alignment. And little did they know, probably they do now - because I'm saying this on an open line - that this was all dependent on some little coins that they stole hundreds if not thousands of years ago from somebody somewhere along the way and put them in the wrong place and tried to wind them up, thinking that it's going to bring something back. Well, nothing came back. Nothing has changed. You know, there is no flip of systems. There is no, what did they call it? "The Rising of the Ball." That was the instruction, "The Rising of the Ball." What ball? I have no idea. Maybe they're gonna be dancing. No, seriously, it's like a ball, all algorithmic, Luciferian something or other. You know, it stands for something. They probably don't even know that either. They just think "Balls. Balls sound good! I'd like to have some balls!"
<br>
<br>Sunny: [laughing]
<br>
<br>Kim: I know. Stop laughing, Sunny, you've got that mic! Look where you took it! Look where you took it in your mind! [laughing] I only said it because I'd like to, you know?
<br>
<br>Sunny: Oh my gosh! [laughing]
<br>
<br>Kim: They thought to themselves that would be good if they got some balls. They said the ball's rising, we need balls over here! Yes we do! Just leave it at that. So yes, so that's kind of the status report with where they're at on their side of it. And they are dropping like flies, and they're dropping rapidly. You know, there's been a number of other operations that they've run looking for signals and those types of things to see if there's some balls returning.
<br>
<br>Sunny [laughing]: I can't!!!
<br>
<br>Kim: Miss Sunny!
<br>
<br>Sunny [covering face with scripts]: I can't!! Okay! I'm okay now!
<br>
<br>Kim: I'll get off that part.
<br>
<br>Sunny [recovering]: Get off the ball!
<br>
<br>Kim: Okay. You can't make this stuff up. You really can't.
<br>
<br>Sunny: I know!
<br>
<br>Kim: Okay. We'll leave them with their... whatever.
<br>
<br>01:07:10
<br>
<br>Okay. Next. Next thing I wanted to discuss today, because I'm really kind of getting tired of hearing about this, but there's a reason for it. They're saying that the White Hat Military - and I'm assuming in most cases they're talking about the United States military - is saving the world. Everything is in the military - these are quotes from the Internet - "Everything is in the military's hands now." "They are protecting us." "They are saving us." And they are doing no such thing. And I'm going to give you a blow-by-blow of some things that have happened since you and I last talked.
<br>
<br>First of all, this morning, very early U.S. Time, the U.S. military hit a convoy of civilians fleeing from the north of Gaza to the south of Gaza, where they were supposed to go for their safety, which was ordered by the government. So what they did is they gathered everybody up in a line and killed 1,000 people today. And this is going to save us all.
<br>
<br>01:08:17
<br>
<br>Next, we all know that the Popular Mobilization Forces, also known as the PMF in Iraq, have been ordered to move artillery into average everyday neighborhoods in Baghdad. Now, why would they be doing that?
<br>
<br>Probably because, at the same time... Let's see... Well, I'll continue on here. So far, the death count in the Gaza Strip is around 10,000 people dead. Those are both Israelis and Americans and Palestinians, 70% of which were women and children. Great job military, saving the world. I can hear it now. I'm feeling the love, I am feeling the love, I can tell you that. The U.S. Air Force has been picking up arms donated by the nation state of Qatar. The Kuwaitis - which we all know are Rothschildians as well; we've discussed that recently - are delivering weapons to Egypt, and the UAE is delivering weapons to Jordan. So what does this tell you? They're preparing for a much larger war here in multiple locations.
<br>
<br>01:09:30
<br>
<br>Now there were some announcements by a gentleman - I can't remember his name - which claims he wants to be in charge of all of the Sunni population of the world. That's Sunni Muslims. He needs every Sunni to register with him if you are going to call yourself a Sunni Muslim. And he would be in charge of appointing all priests and licensing all Imams; that would be his job - you can't preach the Quran to anyone unless you go through him. What does this sound like to you? Are we developing a Sunni Muslim Pope?
<br>
<br>Sunny: Yeah, it does.
<br>
<br>Kim: Now you have to register with the church, and then you do your tithing and all of this stuff, and donations. And then, it just happens to be a coincidence that he's from Egypt. Which just happens to be a coincidence with everyone delivering weapons to Egypt all of the sudden. Are we going to have an uprising? Are we going to have a religious war between the Shias and the Sunnis? I mean, is that what we're doing here? Like, what are we preparing ourselves for? And this, of course, is all brought to you by Langley 5. Remember, Langley 5 is not all American. But they are in charge of the military, and the military - White Hat or otherwise - has not walked away from their orders. Neither has any agency. No one has walked away from taking orders from these people. They are gladly murdering people on the daily.
<br>
<br>01:11:05
<br>
<br>Americans too. American soldiers. So don't fool yourself here. Okay. The British and Canadians, for their part, are delivering arms to Lebanon and allegedly [to] the Hezbollah. Now Iraq - not wanting to really play along - drones were actually sent from Iran. This is how it's done. Okay? This is how the false flag is done. Drones were allegedly sent from Iran to Najaf in Iraq, which is where the Scholars are. A coincidence. And they are not meant for Israel. They are meant to attack the Gulf states in the oil fields, which are predominantly Sunni; are you seeing something - a pattern here? - in a false flag.
<br>
<br>So the Iraqis have no intention of utilizing these, but they need to appear to be Iranian drones, Iranian-made drones, because Iran is predominantly Shia, who will then attack oil fields in false flags in the Sunni region. You got the new Sunni Messiah over there, the new Pope, "Sunni Pope" - we're going to use that term because he's doing the exact same thing as they did when the Catholic Church began hundreds of years ago.
<br>
<br>01:12:30
<br>
<br>Oh, here's another one for you. Wagner. [Russian private military] Remember Wagner, all the talk about Wagner from Russia, the private military group? Has donated surface-to-air missiles to the Hezbollah, which are predominantly, yeah? I know. And then their storage facility appears for all of them to be in Cyprus. So they're also stockpiling a lot of weapons in Cyprus because they think, apparently, if they're not in the war zone, then they won't malfunction at a rapid rate, if you understand me.
<br>
<br>Because you [we] can't tell where you're flying to, and your stupid tail number doesn't mean anything to us. Just because you call yourself Plane X - and they actually have done this on the radar - that doesn't mean I don't know where you came from. I can tell you where the rivet on your damn plane was produced. So let's not fool each other. Let's not lie to each other here. And there's a lot more where this came from, but I'm not going to go into too much detail. But I want you to understand, and I want them to understand, that I can decipher and unstrategize every single thing that they've created in the last 48 hours. And I can do it for you.
<br>
<br>01:13:42
<br>
<br>So it's clear to me, based on this evidence, that they are trying to get Iraq involved in the world war. Specifically, the Najaf region, which is like the Shia Mecca. I mean, there's Mecca also in all of that too, but it's very holy. It's an area that you're not supposed to touch. Of course, then, there would be firing back coming from the Saudis and directly to there, and then there'd be something hitting Mecca, and before you know it, it would end up into a religious war all over the world.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Is that the plan, Kim? Because they're obviously not getting paid. These people are running on promises, but are some people just running on their religious beliefs and just wanting to do this because of their passion behind their religion?
<br>
<br>01:14:32
<br>
<br>Kim: Well, I'm going to tell you bluntly. Every single royal family - I know this for a fact - from Saudi Arabia, UAE, definitely Morocco, and Kuwait for sure. And I know this because I know I have run into, in my life, a lot of strange people. Why I run into these people, I don't know, but sometimes it's a curse and sometimes it's a blessing. In this case, I actually had a sit-down talk with a gentleman that was a member of a Coven, and his area of expertise was the Middle East. And he explained to me - he gave me names, he gave me people, he gave me everything - and he told me about conjuring Djinn.
<br>
<br>01:15:32
<br>
<br>He told me how it works. He said the angels wake up at four a.m., even before the sun. And he said that's when the demons go to sleep. So you conjure at night. He explained to me about the three levels of Djinn, what he called three levels of Djinn that you could conjure. And he was basically talking about the Tarzakians and some Reptilians, and a few other types of Lower Astral beings. And he would do this work on behalf of the royal families in the areas I mentioned to you and others. He also did it for Iran. And he was kind of in charge of that. So, if they needed to conjure a Djinn to do something, they would do the offerings. He explained to me kind of in detail how it would all work. You know, and there were dead people involved. He told me about that, and the younger the better and the more pure the better. And, oh yeah. So I mean, honestly, you have to know; you have to know your enemy. You have to know who you're dealing with. You have to know who these people are.
<br>
<br>01:16:39
<br>
<br>And this was probably about, he was here actually, came here for something else. So we sat for hours, and he explained to me how all this works. So he basically said, "Look, I am telling you right now that in the royal families, there is no such thing as Islam." He said they are 100%, and he explained to me the ones to look out for and Khamenei, and he explained to me in detail that they were all basically Satanists for lack of a better term, and for larger sums of money he would conjure whatever they wanted him to conjure and do whatever he wanted him to do. Yep. Possess people, do all kinds of different stuff. So that was his job.
<br>
<br>01:17:32
<br>
<br>So that right then and there - does that tell you? First of all, you can just put the thought right out of your head that that these are religious people and they're doing this for religion. So the Royal Families in the Middle East, and I'm going to say the INSTALLED Royal Families in the Middle East - for a reason - they do nothing for religion, ever. There is no such thing as religion. Their religion is money and power. That is their religion, and they will do anything to get both. You don't give them any? How long are they going to hang on the hook here? How long are they going to play the game?
<br>
<br>01:18:19
<br>
<br>Meanwhile, they're strategizing. The Shias, they tell them - like I said, it costs a cup of coffee to start a war. And I know exactly how this went. Fake Kushner, whoever the heck that is, goes to Saudi Arabia about a week or two ago, And he starts telling them dreams about supplying all of the oil to Europe, through a pipeline. He starts talking about billions and billions and hundreds of billions and trillions of dollars that they're going to earn, and how they're going to be in charge of the new currency of the Middle East. And all you've got to do is XYZ. But see, you've got to understand how this works, guys. You need to have all of the Sunnis under your umbrella. You need to have them register as souls that you now own. See how this is going?
<br>
<br>01:19:18
<br>
<br>Yeah. And you need to keep all these people in line. There's a lot of things you need to do. Then You go to the Shia side and explain to them that the Sunnis are going to attack you, destroy Islam, and all of this stuff. Then you start moving weapons into Egypt; you move weapons into this; you support this guy, the new Pope of the Sunnis in the Middle East. I know that the Saudis are already on board because the Chinese already broke them. And they're kind of mad at the Chinese a little bit for that, the Chinese side of the Families, because they haven't yet pulled it off. And of course, if you ask any of them ever, on the Family side of it, if you ever say, "Why didn't we get our money back? Why didn't we get paid?" They will say, "Because you screwed up."
<br>
<br>Meanwhile, they lie. That is a lie. They donated everything they had. The Kuwaitis started donating everything they had. The Russians are back in the game, giving weapons to Hezbollah. On the come, I'm assuming on the come, because I'm assuming Wagner probably got him from, let's just say, people in Russia that sell these things. Corruption runs deep. You can get a lot of stuff on the come, but you've got to pay for it.
<br>
<br>01:20:43
<br>
<br>KGB, ex-KGB - because there's no such thing - the KGB guys running the Ukraine-Russia situation over there, on behalf of the Langley 5 person that's Russian, the old director of the KGB - they're not making any money over there in Ukraine anymore. Americans aren't donating; the Europeans aren't donating; they can't even sell the weapons anymore in the black market as much. You're kind of running out of steam over there, but. You know Putin's kind of announcing the Ukraine's broke and all this, and then you know he's right. You know, really, they do have Trump bucks, though. Zelensky has Trump bucks over there.
<br>Sunny: That changes everything!
<br>
<br>01:21:27
<br>
<br>Kim: Yep, oh, that changes everything. So they show them fake numbers on a screen, and they get them all going. This money will be released by tomorrow. Little do they know it's dependent on some coins that they don't even understand going to the wrong location and trying to open up a gateway to do something, whatever this is. But nothing happened, of course. And they lied to everybody; keep everybody moving. So the last 24, 48 hours, they have kept it moving based on the fact that deaths equal open gates in their mind. Now that hasn't worked in a very long time, and they know it, but that doesn't stop them. They just don't want to lose power.
<br>
<br>01:22:06
<br>
<br>So the only reason why they arranged for a meeting with me to take place, probably over the weekend, was because they thought they would have an equal amount or greater power than me and the power to block me and proof that we had to work together in order to make it happen. Now, I know something. Number 1, there's no such thing as working together with these people. You either own them or you don't. They either work for you or they don't. That's a fact. Number 2, we kindly explained to them that there would be consequences to their actions if they go off the new reservation. Very clear. I never expected them to actually - not Langley 5 anyway - I never expected them to come to the party. Because I knew this wasn't going to work. I figured this out last night.
<br>
<br>1:23:01
<br>
<br>So I knew, well, yeah. I'm like, what is this ball dropping they're all talking about, or ball rising, or whatever it was? And then we had to figure out what they were doing. So, the fact that this didn't work, now nobody's calling anybody back. Wait, where'd you go, friends? It's never going to happen. They're never going to be in this position again. We were in the Dark Ages for three billion years. Let's just say, by some freak accident, Source falls and bumps his head and decides to recreate The Ages. That could happen. Now, if that happened, then you would be about three billion years out from having a position like you used to have before. And remember - I will remind you that you were never in charge of beep - nothing. You were never in charge of anything, ever. You were dependent on someone else, something else, some quantum system elsewhere. And so many different factors, you had no idea what the heck was going on in this world.
<br>
<br>1:24:15
<br>
<br>So this little fake war thing, this little religious war thing here, we're telling everybody. We're telling everybody what you're doing. I'm calling every country. I'm telling every single person everywhere what you're doing. I know whose phones to call, I know who listens to whose phones, and the jig is up. It is so easy to out-strategize you people; it's ridiculous. And by the way, you should probably check and see if your weapons are still working in Cyprus, idiots.
<br>
<br>You know, it's so easy to play this game. But the killing has to end. Killing for coins, let's call it. It's not even coin money, spendable cash. It's some artifact from 2,500 years ago. Anyway, But that's these people, and this is what they do. So I highly doubt I'll ever be getting a phone call back from these people, because it won't happen unless they feel like they're in charge of something. They'll probably call and say they're coming again, and I'll put on my best pajamas and wait it out. I'm not expecting anything.
<br>
<br>Sunny: So just to clarify, Kim, right now are we talking about Langley 5? You don't expect to hear anything from them because I think sometimes, I know I get confused, we talk about operatives versus Langley or Langley 5. We just explain that.
<br>
<br>01:25:45
<br>
<br>Kim: Okay, Langley 5 is the last rung. You remember we had - in the Black Sun side - we had "People in Planes," above them Covens, and Coven Masters. We had so on and so forth up to the top there. Then, behind, next to the "People who Fly in Planes" - other than their clones on the ground - you would've had Langley 5. These are generals. They would be similar but greater than your Jesuit generals, I would say.
<br>
<br>Kim and Sunny: [talking over each other]And those people... But some are. Some are also Jesuits. Okay. Okay. Knights of Malta. Sorry. Oh, and, no, just kidding.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Those are the people you don't expect to hear from, not the operatives. It's Langley 5, you don't expect to hear from?
<br>
<br>Kim: Yeah. It's looking to me like... you know, these guys have been doing this for a long time. They've been on the ground in various locations. They know how this whole thing works. They see it from the upper, first hand, on the ground and from the, how do I say it, the balcony seats. They're looking down, and they're seeing the whole big picture of what's happening there, and they know they're not going to pull it off. These are the guys that either, you know, these are your black bankers, your black bankers that used to make the money for the war. The Treaty of Versailles cash collectors - they are the guys that go sit down and have a cup of coffee and arrange for these crazy things to take place. And they know what they're doing. But for millions and millions of dollars, they do all this stuff.
<br>
<br>That's what they do. They're fixers. They're freelancers. They're operatives, however you want to call them. But in the industry, that's what they're called.
<br>
<br>01:27:45
<br>
<br>So the writing's on the wall here. You know, we can go work with her. We can get paid. We could have gotten paid two months ago; we could have gotten paid six months ago; we could have gotten paid two years ago with all the money that I've put into various places. You could have gotten paid a long time ago, and the only time you did get paid was when Trump took it from me. On a diplomatic line, there's proof, connected directly to the Treasury in New York. And you could have gotten paid then too. So, these people don't spend their own money. You know, very rarely. So we'll see.
<br>
<br>01:28:33
<br>
<br>We'll see how this all pans out, but right now there is no - there should be by the end of the day today - no delay in deposits. They shouldn't have the ability to do that. So to clear that up, it doesn't matter how many stolen artifacts they try to use; send me a crypt text tied to a demon in the Lower Astral or whatever it is they want to do; it's not going to change the fact of what's happened. You know, they just refuse to remember that they had upper management. Not only did they have upper management, there was an Anti-Source that existed in the Multiverse that was your true boss. And your true boss has left you. Your Lucifer has left you. All these people have left you, and they have gone back to their respective holding places or wherever it is they go during a Light Age - whatever Source decides to do with his other side. So there's nothing left there.
<br>
<br>01:29:33
<br>
<br>And what you're fighting for is your own personal power and your own personal existence. But the Universe is against you. It's not just me. You can hate me all you want, but it's not me. I'm just doing - I'm the smart one here. And what I mean by that is that I'm the one that says, oh look, Source said blah blah blah blah blah. Oh look. And I'm like, "Okay, that's what we'll do." You know, everything has changed. You making a fake little war, tiny, tiny war over here in the Middle East is not going to change it. Yes, you've killed some organic innocents. For that, you're all dying. But it's not going to change anything. It's not going to make the purse strings open up. It's not going to change anything.
<br>
<br>01:30:33
<br>
<br>Submitting more agreements to me is not going to make me approve them. You know? I haven't decided to, I don't know, start filtering through the Hall of Records and drinking or something. I'm like, what do you think is going to happen here? You're going through the same lines that I talk to everybody else on. And you think you're going to get me to change my mind. But you don't have the... the balls didn't rise, and you haven't come here to sit down and have a conversation. Which is something you would have never been able to do with the person that was opposite me in the same position. You would have never had the privilege to do that.
<br>
<br>01:31:28
<br>
<br>And I'm not saying - I don't need a chicken for my table, and I don't need a STICK, and I don't need some weird ritual where you spin around three times, and I don't do adrenachrome, so I don't need any of that either; don't bring me any small children; I'm not into that in any way. So there's none of this. I just want to sit down like normal people and have a normal conversation. You threaten me now we have a problem, but if that doesn't happen and you want to sit down like an adult, fine. But I automatically know, based on what's happened in the last 24 hours, that you are full, and I'm going to swear this time, you're full of shit. You are full of it.
<br>
<br>01:32:07
<br>
<br>You know, it's not what a person says; it's what they do. And with these people here, you always have to expect that it is a lie. And you have to look for the 1% truth in there.
<br>
<br>So let's hope we have a better weekend than we had a Friday. You know we're not doing terrible here, guys. I mean, we have made so many strides, and I know for some of you it's not enough. You know everybody wants a monetary relief, and I understand that. And I want to give that to you too. But I also don't want these people attacking you. I don't want Smalltown, USA, to become Gaza Strip because you got money. Or New Zealand. Or wherever. Or you started building projects that they feel the need to drone and kill how many people. These people are not right; they're not okay. There is a short circuit in their brain, and they just can't stop.
<br>
<br>01:33:09
<br>
<br>They've been liars their whole life, their whole adult life, and they are going to continue to lie, cheat, and steal, even from their own people. Probably their own spouses as well. I'm not even going to say probably in most cases. Look at Petraeus and a bunch of other people. So that's just the ones that, you know, they put that dirt on the street is what they call it. Because they went off the reservation. Didn't take orders right. Wanted to go against orders for some reason. That's how they kept everybody in line - fear and greed. And you're running out of fear, and you're running out of greed.
<br>
<br>So hopefully, we'll have a better, a good weekend. I'm hoping. I'm hoping things get better when no money comes, but it doesn't look like that's the case. But this is not a religious war by any means. This is a bunch of people that are waiting for their balls to rise.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Well, yeah, but even at the, let's just call it the soldier level, those people think it is a religious war, though.
<br>
<br>Kim: Yes, they do. Yes, they do. And the answer to the question? It's not. Yeah. And it's the same thing with Israel too. And even the - I'm going to call them the real Jewish people - because they're not the same as the not Jewish people, the Satanists. Netanyahu included. You do know that, right? You know, he is not Jewish. Well, I guess you could say maybe by birth, but he is a Satanist. 100 percent. But there are a lot of people, even in Israel, that are protesting against the war. And they don't show you a lot of that on TV, of course, because then that would mean that...
<br>
<br>Sunny: Destroy the narrative.
<br>
<br>Kim: Yeah, destroy the narrative. You can't have that. So, I'm sure we could - probably even here - get a lot of field messengers from Israel because we have a lot of people there that watch us as well. You know, to go talk to people. Why don't you go talk to the people? What do the people think of this?
<br>
<br>So that's about the world situation as it stands right now. And the war, real war, against the Deep State. What's left of it.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Okay. Well, let's go ahead and we'll take a quick break, and then we'll come back with some video questions.
<br>
<br>Kim: Sounds good.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Okay.
<br>
<br>01:35:55
<br>
<br>[station break]
<br>
<br>01:36:53
<br>
<br>Sunny: And now it's time to connect with Kim. Our news team has selected three questions from our audience, and here is the first one.
<br>
<br>Kwahu Sefah Boateng: Hi, Kim. This is Fah Boateng from Ghana, West Africa. Please, I would like to know, as we progress in the Alpha system or the Light system, is there going to be a time where women can produce children or can conceive babies without the involvement of men? Thank you very much.
<br>
<br>Sunny: So Kim, is there going to be a time where women can reproduce without men? I think I know the answer to this question, but I'll let you answer it.
<br>
<br>Kim: What do you think?
<br>
<br>Sunny: I think we're going to be able to manifest children.
<br>
<br>Kim: I think so too. Well, if you... So, typically - not all the time, okay - but typically, when a child is conceived, it is out of love. Typically. Not all the time, but there's also a lot of changes that take place between a couple when they are together. Meaning, you're opening yourself up more, there's a lot of love flowing, which is basically the love and light of Source that flows through you. It doesn't matter if you're conceiving a child or not. Obviously, we have a lot of couples that don't do things like that, but it's out of love. There's a certain amount, even if you're a couple that doesn't have children naturally, whether you're a man and a woman, or a man and a man, or whatever the situation might be. There's still a lot of love intent that goes towards the conception of the child, whether you realize it or not. You know, there's a lot of love, a lot of light that comes into the world when these things happen. So that's whether you are together in the biblical sense, you know, or you are even having a child together as a couple, maybe not in a physical way. So to answer your question, in the Alphaverse, it is possible to reproduce without an act of... How do I say that? Getting together in the biblical sense, that's what I call it, for lack of a better term.
<br>
<br>Sunny: The physical side.
<br>
<br>Kim: The physical side of it. It's just that your love as a couple - wanting a child - or even a single person that wants a child. Your love has been metered down by Dark Matter and Dark Energy and Dark Consciousness programs. Once that changes, and there'll be some learning to do - especially for us older generations - as you had said in the news earlier, Sunny, until you're the age of seven, your brain is in constant theta mode. You know, us as adults don't necessarily, we don't have the opportunity to do that because we're running like hamsters on a wheel all the time.
<br>
<br>So I would say that there'll be a process of restoration. The way we work will change. There's a lot of things that will change. Our stress levels will change. And once that is possible, then we can start learning about how to do these things.  And yes, it is possible.
<br>
<br>Sunny: So that means it would be possible for men to conceive, in the theta sense, let's say, children as well as women. So this isn't just a - I know his question was specifically about women, can women do this without men - but you know, if we're doing this on a completely different level, it really doesn't matter your gender, right?
<br>
<br>Kim: Yeah, it shouldn't. No. We do have some DNA functions and we are a little different, built different in some ways. But ultimately, when we get to the point where you can change your physical appearance, you can repair your own vessel, you can do a lot of different things. Ultimately you should be able to - if you're granted the soul, because remember, all souls come from Source - if you're granted the soul, then you can manifest the physical body.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Interesting. That's fascinating.
<br>
<br>Kim: Isn't it?
<br>
<br>Sunny: That's a good question, too. Yeah, absolutely. Ok, well, let's go to our second question.
<br>
<br>01:41:44
<br>
<br>Ademola Adebjano: Hi there, Kim. Ade's my name from Nigeria. You once described how consciousness came into existence in the very beginning. Can you give more explanations, especially in relation to the Alpha and Omega systems? And how is it that you own the Alpha system? And if so, how did Marduk take control and lose control of the Alpha system? Thank you.
<br>
<br>Kim: Well. The Alpha system. First of all, I mean, that was a lot of questions in 30 seconds, I can tell you that right now. The Alpha system came to be because Source made it so. The Omega system came to be because Anti-Source made it so. Now, quantum systems do have their own consciousness on both sides. And for many years, repeating over and over and over again, I have been the main operator, so to speak, of the Alpha system. And my opposite party, Aries, was obviously the operator of the Omega system.
<br>
<br>01:43:00
<br>
<br>Now, consciousness. Everything is a creation of Source itself, the Creator, meaning a light Source. For a time during a Neutral Age, which was also its creation, it allowed for the creation of a dark Multiverse. But at that time, they stayed on their side, we stayed on our side. There was no intermingling in any way, shape, or form.
<br>
<br>Consciousness is present in every organic life form on this side of the Multiverse. You have Source consciousness; you have a collective consciousness. Things you do here, you may not realize it. You know in the past you know you're having a bad day, you say some things maybe you don't mean, and then you are feeding a dark consciousness program of the Lower Astral. Remember, everything down there is created inorganically; therefore, it is artificial to a degree. But it's based on AI, quantum AI systems that have their own consciousness. It developed more programs and more programs and more programs to run every type of consciousness thought that you could have possibly thought of. Into an infinite way.
<br>
<br>And that's why Marduk here was called the Marduk [mar:sea; duke:king]. He was the Marduk and the king of the consciousnesses. So Source creates consciousness. Source is the only creator. We co-create because we are a part of the Creator. They, on the other hand, in the dark world, do not co-create. There is no co-creation there. We are responsible for creating some of their programs, believe it or not.
<br>
<br>01:45:03
<br>
<br>You know, they had a lot of cylindrical satellites, not only around Earth, but many places in the Universe that would study your behavior. And what would you most likely do in this situation? And how could they possibly get you to do X, Y, or Z? They really need you to do that bad thing and feed that bad consciousness and connect yourself to it. So a consciousness, just like all things, is created by the Creator.
<br>
<br>So, Marduk. Marduk actually took essence from me in a previous lifetime and had a very short stint of control over a portion, not all, of the Alpha system. It started with the security of the Alpha system. That was a partnership he made with the Council of Nine. And he made a lot of promises and then would say, "Oh hey, they chose it. Look, they're choosing to let all these things happen." So to some limited degree, he had some access to some things, but the Council of Nine could have kicked him out at any time. So eventually it was me. And the rest is history from here; we've talked about that many times but I hope that answers your question. All consciousness, all beings, everything is created with Source.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Okay. And here's our final question.
<br>
<br>01:46:34
<br>
<br>Bernhard: Hello Kim. This is Bernhard from the mountains in Upper Austria. My question is on the Archivists. Who pays them? Who put them in place? What are their duties? And do they appear in public, like could they testify in a court case? And how to contact them, like especially the one who is responsible for Austria. Thank you.
<br>
<br>Sunny: The archivists. Do they come out in public? Are they just working constantly?
<br>
<br>Kim: They do. They do. You do see them in public. They look like humans. They are not people. They are very light beings that have done this job to record history. There's a certain amount of non-interference that they have had to live under as recorders of history. I would say they have a lot of information. They have educated all of us a lot. They have tried anyway in some cases. And they are now being a little bit more - now that we've transitioned into the Light Age - they're being a little more proactive with, let's just say, giving certain amounts of people certain information. They are trying to tell people, because remember they're not - don't get me wrong, you don't want to get on their wrong side in a dark alley. I can tell you that right now. They know how to do it, let's just say. You know, in the defense of their own life or the life of an innocent, remember. So they have rules too. But we're all aware of how these weapons work in the physical world. And I would say that they don't really need pay. You won't someday either. But they can pretty much manifest anything they need. If they need food, they most likely like food. I mean it's not a necessity. They're a little different, let's just say in the way that they are able to sustain themselves. Because remember, they're just projecting an image to you that they're a normal human. So I would say I do know that some, and I know Tom has seen them for who they really are. They've been...
<br>
<br>Sunny: Really?
<br>
<br>Kim: Yeah, there's a reason for that. I won't get into that today, but yes.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Did he say what he saw? Or have you seen it to know what they look like? Probably varies.
<br>
<br>Kim: I have lost Sunny. Oh, you're back now.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Oh, I'm back. You can hear me now.
<br>
<br>Kim: I'm sorry I missed what you said.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Oh, I said, did Tom tell you what they look like? Or have you seen it for yourself to know?
<br>
<br>Kim: I know what they look like. They are... human, look human-y with a twist; best way I can describe it. They are very light. Less dense than we are. I can say that. Yeah, but they knew what they were getting into when they came here and chose this job. But they have a lot of skills that we someday will remember and possess. So, if they need food, they have it. If they needed something, they have it. If they needed a particular machine to do some healing on one another, they have it. They can make all that stuff. They couldn't step outside the boundaries of: we are here to record history; that is our job here.
<br>
<br>01:50:52
<br>
<br>Now the ones that I call "the Coalition," they also have a few members of the Coalition that became Archivists. Let's call them the Light Infiltrators, so to speak. There are a lot of people in a lot of places on this planet that are infiltrators or they're here to do a specific mission. And we're all kind of in the same boat. You know, it's not malicious towards humanity, it's not malicious towards Earth. I'm sure certain people are scared to death of these people, because they take the whole James Bond thing like to a whole other level as a matter of fact. We do know the Coalition. We do talk to them all the time. So yeah, that's who the Archivists are. As far as... They are more global Archivists. They're not country by country, although they support the National Archives of Countries. They are more of a global organization that travels from place to place. You know, you might see one party specifically more rooted in one region, whereas you might see other parties float from region to region. They do have global meetings all together once in a while. So yeah that's pretty much who they are.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Very interesting. All right well if you would like to submit a question for Kim you can send us a video but it has to be you on camera. Please submit your questions at 30 seconds or less. Submit your video through our website, unitednetwork.news, under the field messenger tab. Our news team, along with Kim, will select a few questions to answer at the end of each newscast.
<br>
<br>All right, Kim, that pretty much wraps it up. Anything else you want to say?
<br>
<br>01:52:42
<br>
<br>Kim: Have a wonderful weekend.
<br>
<br>Sunny: You too.
<br>
<br>Kim: That's the thing, yeah. Yeah, if that's the thing. Have two days that we don't do news. That's what it is. Have a happy two days without news!
<br>
<br>Sunny: That's what it is. And hopefully, the people watching this that are on the other side will make wise choices, smart choices over the weekend.
<br>
<br>Kim: That's right, make good life choices. There's my golden retriever saying, "Hello everybody." It must be time for a W-A-L-K. Yeah, she knows usually when I would finish the news that it would be time for a W-A-L-K.
<br>
<br>Sunny: All right, well, thank you, Kim.
<br>
<br>Kim: You hear her? She sounds like a Wookiee from Star Wars, doesn't she?
<br>
<br>Sunny: She does.
<br>
<br>Kim: All right, well, have a wonderful weekend, Sunny.
<br>
<br>Sunny: All right, you too.
