        <br>Kim:  Hi, everyone. This reminds me of the Life Force days, if you've been around that long. That was kind of fun. So...
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  ... and then I'll unmute you.
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  All right. So... We are going to do this kind of the old way. So if you have a question - we need everybody to raise their hand.
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  You are unmuted.

        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Okay. Kim, can you hear me? This is Nat.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:07:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Oh, somebody muted me again. Yes, I can hear you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:07:26</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Kim, I'm going to hit "Mute All" continuously, so if you see yourself muted, please unmute yourself. There's so many people - only because sometimes I can hear lots of people. So it looks like, so far from what I can see, we're going to have Emma first, and then Isabel, and then Terry, and then Phil. But we'll start - I'll remind you - we're going to start with Emma. Emma is the first one.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:07:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Hi, Emma.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:07:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Emma:  Hello. Thank you for taking me first. I'm honored. I'm a Field Messenger, so I'm active on UNN. My question is, what is the best way to raise our consciousness?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:08:12</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  I'm going to mute all continuously, so if you see yourself muted, please unmute yourself.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:08:21</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Okay. Raise your consciousness.
        <br>
        <br>Well, what is "raising your consciousness," first of all, right?
        <br>
        <br>Consciousness - in my opinion - "raising your consciousness" means you're connecting with Source and you're connecting to that wisdom that is given to us freely throughout the Multiverse. It wasn't as easy as it is now. It's becoming easier and easier.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:08:48</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Unknown:  No, you come up here!
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:08:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Oh.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:08:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Unknown:  Come on. Come on.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:08:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Go ahead and mute.
        <br>
        <br>So, if you want to raise your consciousness, the first thing I would try to do is communicate with the Creator. That's first of all, because there is no greater wisdom than that [which] comes from the Creator. I would say raising your consciousness is...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:09:17</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Unknown:  I'm going to have some coffee and muffins.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:09:26</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Keeps muting me too. That's okay. We're trying something new, so please bear with us. This has been requested by a lot of people that we do it this way, so we're going to give it a go. We'll see how it goes. [laughing]
        <br>
        <br>It's been a little rough, rocky start, but we're getting there.
        <br>
        <br>But raising your consciousness to me is all about connecting to the Creator. It's not even so much something that you're going to do by yourself because we are all part of a collective consciousness. And just remember when things get rough or they feel topsy-turvy that there's always that place of solstice there that you can, or solace I should say, that you can connect to and act accordingly. So what you...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:10:17</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Unknown:  I'd be on that one.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:10:20</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Your reaction may not be the same if you are connecting directly to the Creator, is I guess what I would say. So, in my opinion, that's how you "raise your consciousness."
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:10:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Emma: Thank you so much.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:10:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Thank you. Thank you, Emma.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:10:37</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Here we go. Who do we have next, Nat?

        <small><br><small>02:10:45</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  I just, Emma... Oh, so many things just happened, Kim.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:10:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  So many things happened. Okay, let's see. Who will I pick?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:10:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Anna.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:11:00</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  There you go.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:11:01</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Anna.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:11:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Anna:  Hello?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:11:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Anna?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:11:04</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Anna:  Hello, can you hear me?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:11:09</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  I can.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:11:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Anna:  I know this is probably a question that's not easily answered, but do you see or think that there would ever be like a quicker or quick disclosure to everybody, or is it going to be probably more likely drip-fed over a couple of years?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:11:31</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, you know, I think we need to look at things sometimes from a broader perspective. You know, what is the reason for disclosure, first of all? The reason for disclosure typically is to change people's mindsets, to let them know this is out there, so to speak. That's part of it.
        <br>
        <br>Sometimes people want disclosure because they want everybody to know that, "Well, I'm not crazy," you know? Like, "Look, this is really happening." But, oftentimes I feel that some types of disclosure are -
        <br>
        <br>[screen goes white]
        <br>
        <br>I don't know what's going on there...
        <br>
        <br>But some types of disclosure are important because it helps people to make their own decisions, and educated decisions.
        <br>
        <br>And I think that some types of disclosure... is it going to be helpful? How much information do you think that the average everyday person - that doesn't know any of this - can actually handle?
        <br>
        <br>Do we want to do something that's for people's benefit? Or do we want to do something that could potentially be harmful, or make people fearful?
        <br>
        <br>Our goal is to help people understand that there is a better way to live, and a better way to be, and what life really is - and that we have options.
        <br>
        <br>And I think that it's important sometimes - and the information will be there, just as it is now - the information is there for the people that want to hear it. When they're ready.
        <br>
        <br>And I think that might be one of the best ways to do it, unless, Anna, you can think of another way to do that where we wouldn't be harming people.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:13:31</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Anna:  No, I see what you're saying. I just, I guess I wanted to just ask.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:13:37</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Oh, no. No worries.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:13:40</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Yeah, it's just...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:13:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Anna:  Thank you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:13:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Yeah, because people are going to be fearful enough if something happens in the public eye, like media goes down or government goes down or something like that.
        <br>
        <br>They're going to be very nervous, because they feel they need that. And oftentimes throughout our history - at least our told history - when a government goes down or changes leaders unexpectedly, let's just say - not through a normal process - it creates a lot of fear amongst the population.
        <br>
        <br>Now imagine that happening to the whole world and how people are going to feel. And so it's going to be our job - meaning all of the people here and all of the people you know - to help those people through the turbulent time without causing mass chaos amongst the people.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:14:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So I think, [by] knowing, you'll become kind of - not a savior, but you'll become the helpful people, let's just say - the people that are in the know.
        <br>
        <br>Remember, your views aren't the same as everybody else's either, and they're just probably trying to feed their family, or have a concern: if they had a government job, what do they do now?
        <br>
        <br>And they're just people that work at the Department of Motor Vehicles or something, they don't know what's really going on.
        <br>
        <br>So it's going to be up to us to help people find other jobs, other ways of making income, show people a better life, and I think that's the most important thing.
        <br>
        <br>And then somebody - some lucky scriptwriting person [smiling] - is going to get to rewrite history and release it as a series. [chuckle]
        <br>
        <br>So, there are good points to media, and there are good things that can come from disclosure - you know, what really happened. I'm sure people would love to hear that, especially people that have been in countries where the history has been told incorrectly - like, pretty much everybody.
        <br>
        <br>But they lived through it; they were there - and they know that's not what happened - and they'll tell you that. So, hopefully, we will have some types of disclosure in the near future, where people can actually feel like, "Look, I saw this happen - this happened to me. I was there."
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:16:13</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  So, I think it's kind of important, too, for people to move on sometimes to really feel that they're not crazy - the whole world is lying - and they just want the truth out there. So there'll be some of that that will help with healing, too.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:16:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Anna:  That makes sense. Thank you very much.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:16:35</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Anna:  Thank you, Anna.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:16:37</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Okay, Kim, the next person is Kristy.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:16:38</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Okay. Kristy?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:16:38</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kristy:  Hi, Kim. Thank you for taking my call. This is more a personal question, I guess, but I'm just curious. When you first met Marduk with your former stepfather, did you ever get to have a conversation with him later about who that was? And did he know who it was when he brought you there? Thank you. I'm just so curious about that, but thank you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:17:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Yeah. He actually wasn't my stepfather stepfather - he was my mother's significant other. They were engaged for a time; he was also my brother's father.
        <br>
        <br>I was too young and it was a semi-public setting, let's just say, that I remember - because it was really weird - that he would be introducing me to one of his friends.
        <br>
        <br>There was no conversation really from my part. I was probably about eight years old, so I really didn't have much to say to any grown-ups unless they were talking to me about how to braid my hair or put on my leg warmers or something, you know, at that time.
        <br>
        <br>So it was more about - I just remember - I remember the flower. And I remember this person trying to be nice to me.
        <br>
        <br>Do I think he knew? I think he knew something. Let me put it that way to you.
        <br>
        <br>Turns out there was definitely a history there with that person. I didn't find out until obviously many, many years later.
        <br>
        <br>And he was definitely involved with some government people and definitely a Mason. And his kids were involved in the military and agency people and that kind of thing.
        <br>
        <br>So yeah, I would say they probably knew a lot more than I did or suspected at that time.
        <br>
        <br>I was in a restaurant-type bar setting. Rarely would I ever get taken to such a place, so that was odd unto itself. But I was playing with the buttons on the jukebox. So, I didn't know at that time. I felt something was strange and off because I remember it vividly, but other than that, no.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:19:28</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Okay, Kim, the next person is Zoe Koffler.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:19:34</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Hi, Zoe.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:19:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Zoe:  Can you hear me now?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:19:38</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  I can.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:19:43</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Zoe:  Hi, Kim. Thank you so much. I'm so grateful for you in so many ways. But my question is kind of a personal question, because part of my awakening has to deal with the Hindu deities and that pantheon. The question is: What is the truth about these beings - specifically Shiva? Because personally, that being has given me a lot of problems. So I just wanted to hear your take on those beings and any AIs that they're associated with, and any information. Thank you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:20:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  You know, I have had a lot of experience, at least, not from your side of things - probably how you woke up - meaning, with those different beings over the years.
        <br>
        <br>Oftentimes, throughout our history, too, they don't just play one role; they'll play several roles. I always think of that song by the Rolling Stones, "Sympathy for the Devil." You know, "After all, it was you and me," you know? And he would recount all these different instances of things that happened throughout our history and say, "It was you and me."
        <br>
        <br>And oftentimes they are presenting themselves in such a way as to gain people's trust and also to, you know, orchestrate a following - a large following for these people - because you give them a lot of energy.
        <br>
        <br>Do I know some of the beings that have played those roles? Yep, I do. Do I see them as a positive thing? No, they'd laugh oftentimes at us, unfortunately. Same thing goes with the person or being that played Buddha and the being that played, you know, different biblical characters throughout history.
        <br>
        <br>Some of what they portray, though, I will say - and the theories and the practices - aren't terrible. The key is to remember that it's you and the Creator; that's it. You don't need an intercessor; you don't need a being, a deity - you just need you and the Creator. And that's all. 100%.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:22:40</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  If those people help you get there, or going to a building, a church, a country, a temple, a high mountain, or whatever it is that the beings that - or the practices that get you there - get you there, just remember, and this is what I tell everybody: it's you and the Creator.
        <br>
        <br>It's not me and the Creator and you; it's you and the Creator. And if that kind of opened your eyes to something a little different, then it's probably not all that bad.
        <br>
        <br>But I would say I have had instances, though, where there are people that have been practicing a specific way - following maybe gurus of days gone by - and I've had backlash when I try to tell them the truth.
        <br>
        <br>And what ends up happening is, like, I had a being, a female deity, let's call them a female deity, who came forward and said, "You're stealing my man." I'm like, "Well, I'm not stealing your man. What do you mean? Who are you, and what do you want?"
        <br>
        <br>So they definitely feel some kind of ownership over the people that feel they need to go through them to get to the Creator - or to get to the Ultimate Source - however you say that.
        <br>
        <br>So that's the only thing that I see as the major downfall of that. But you can; you have the sovereign will to leave any being at any given time - cut all cords, cut all ties - regardless of where you were in the past. If that being is giving you problems, I would basically tell it... or just cut all cords and ties and all spiritual connections on every level. Cut your essence, your energy, your consciousness from that being, and that should end.

        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Okay, thank you. The next person is Lea Christie.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:24:55</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Hi, Lea.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:24:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Lea:  Oh, hold on.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:25:01</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  How are you, Lea?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:25:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Lea:  I'm good. How are you? Can you guys - hi, how are you?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:25:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  I can hear you. I'm good.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:25:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Lea:  Good, good. So, my heart has so much love for you, Kim. Thank you for everything that you do. I appreciate you so much.
        <br>
        <br>So, I am currently a loan officer - I'm a mortgage person. And I feel like I'm an agent for something that is wrong - like an agent for debt, you know? And so how do mortgages look in the future?
        <br>
        <br>Because I feel like I'm at this, I feel like something is nudging me away, but I love making people's dreams come true. I mean, buying a house is a monumentous event for people, but I would love, I always took advantage of like the no down payment or like the MSHDA, down payment assistance.
        <br>
        <br>So my question to you is: what do mortgages look like in the future? And could I transition from what I'm doing now to what's coming?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:25:59</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  I think, absolutely. It's a system that has to be reworked. It has to be redone. I mean, to go into debt for that long of a period of time really doesn't serve anyone. And then, you know, a long, long time ago when dinosaurs roamed the earth, I used to work for a bank. I worked in marketing. I worked in a lot of different departments. I had my own bank. So, I mean, it was a great learning experience for me.
        <br>
        <br>And like you, when you could really help people out of their financial situation or into a better place, that type of thing - or the dream of owning their own business - always made me happy.
        <br>
        <br>And you're doing it with a pure heart and kindness, and I understand it's a debt and that type of thing. But people that are moving into a new home or their first home don't see it that way.
        <br>
        <br>In the future, we have no need, really, for interest - because we're not issuing bonds against them. You know how they collateralize all those pools and that type of thing. And that's where your CDOs... and then they strip off the coupons, and they become, you know, even derivatives and that type of thing.
        <br>
        <br>But all in all, you know, you're giving a family a home - or helping, at this point. Until there is a better product - like you said, you're looking for that down payment assistance - you're looking for the programs that can help people get into a place that they can afford.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:27:49</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  They'll also be part of the Essentials Program. One of the things that I've been looking at is we have a lot of government housing around the world, whether it was a byproduct of communism in some places, and in other places, we have - like here in the U.S. - we have things called the Projects.
        <br>
        <br>I don't know if you've ever heard of the Projects - they're government housing - they're kind of like a Section 8 type thing. But it's a little community. Oftentimes they're run down. Nobody repairs them, that kind of thing. But the rent is really cheap, and it's based on your income.
        <br>
        <br>And I think that we can create a mortgage program that works much the same way. But there still has to be some level of accountability out there, for a time. You know, maybe the interest rate scares them...
        <br>
        <br>- that kind of thing. But the rent is really cheap, and it's based on your income. [This is a delayed replay from the previous paragraph - compliments of a suddenly unmuted Zoom caller.]
        <br>
        <br>I'm replaying myself. I didn't do that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:28:56</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Lea:  It was just an echo.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:28:57</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Oh, okay. So I think that there is a way to use some of the idea where, for example, if we were to fix and buy all of those project properties, or those government-owned properties, refurbish those properties.
        <br>
        <br>And then have, in some cases, people rely on it for a place to live, you know, where they could have the pride of homeownership for the same thing they're paying right now. And then we could probably work our way into something a little differently.
        <br>
        <br>Remember, everything we do is going to affect the construction industry. It's going to affect other people's jobs that rely on income from selling homes and that type of thing.
        <br>
        <br>So it's going to be a holistic way of doing it, where we develop different ways of paying for those things, and then we put them under a different umbrella.
        <br>
        <br>Because if not, then the home builder's not going to sell any homes, or they're not going to make the money back that it cost to build the homes. Then that's going to affect the lumber industry or wood industry, which is then going to affect the people that make the nails.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:30:08</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Lea:  It's a domino effect, yeah.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:30:10</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  It's a domino effect. So, you have to take into consideration reworking the programs that are available to people in a way that they can afford, you know, to get into a home without, you know, slaving away and working their whole life as part of maybe the Essentials Program is probably the key here where there's a subsidy that comes from Essentials or from C.A.R.E.
        <br>
        <br>And that way they can get into the home that they afford without putting all of the lumber people and the home builder people and the construction people and the air conditioning-maker people out of work. So, you know, when you make one small move, it's never small. It's huge when you're looking at changing the way all of humanity does something.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:30:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Lea:  Okay. Well, thank you, Kim. I appreciate your insight. I really do. You have a great rest of your day.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:31:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Thanks, Leah. You too.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:31:06</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Thank you. The next person is Irene.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:31:09</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Irene?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:31:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Irene:  Hello, Kim. Oh, it's such a pleasure to see you and speak with you. I honor you. Thank you so much for what you're doing for humanity. My question is, I know that you mentioned this before in one of your reports, that this was not your first go-around coming here and trying to do this. So, in this lifetime for you - and this is for you, the question is in this lifetime - did you remember who you were when you were such a tiny tot, or was that a gradual thing?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:31:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  You know, I had - when I was very young - I had a lot of nightmares and saw a lot of things. Did I know that this was what I was going to do? No.
        <br>
        <br>You know, and pretty much everybody that comes here gets wiped in some way. You know, you are memory wiped, you go into the incarnation cycle, as it were, and it's partially done for your protection because - I know there's a lot of people, probably even on here right now - that have memories of things that are not of this lifetime. And sometimes you think it's deja vu - "Oh! I've done this before," you know, "Why does this seem so familiar to me?" Sometimes it's just an intuition; sometimes it's a dream you can't stop having.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:32:40</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  So, I'd say I didn't really just say anything to anybody, really, until the last few years - maybe the last decade tops - where I actually even mentioned anything to anybody. But I was having all this stuff go on for a long time. I mean, innately speaking, I've always had what I needed when I needed it. Meaning, the answer would come as I needed the answer.
        <br>
        <br>And I'm glad I didn't know this 10 years ago or 15 years ago or 20 years ago. And I'm not saying I didn't know eventually who I was and what I was doing. I mean, I figured that out sometime, you know, probably around 2010, but maybe even a little bit before, maybe 2007.
        <br>
        <br>But I've always had these dreams and these visions and these forethoughts and this, you know, the knowingness of something - just putting all the pieces together. But, I'll be the first one to tell you, I learn every day - I learn something new every single day about the way this universe works.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:34:04</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Irene:  Thank you, Kim.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:34:08</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  So, I'm never afraid to tell you I didn't know, you know, that I made a mistake. I'm just as honest as I can be and I'm just human. So.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:34:20</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Irene:  I thank you so much.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:34:22</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  You're welcome.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:34:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Okay, the next person is Jill W. ... Jill W.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:34:29</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Jill:  Hi, Kim.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:34:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Hi, Jill.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:34:35</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Jill:  Thanks for taking the call. I'm wondering, even if the federal governments go down - I actually have two questions, but if the federal government goes down, what happens to all of the farms that are run by these big... by the federal government?
        <br>
        <br>Jill: We have cow farms where I live in the U.S. - I live in New York State - and it's a dairy farm, and they have 3,000, probably 3,000 head, but they're government subsidized. And they just keep, they know how to do the paperwork, they know how to do everything that they need to do to get more money out of the government.
        <br>
        <br>Jill: And the smaller farmers call them pretty much the welfare farms. But they're the ones that are taking over a lot of the smaller farms. When those farmers die off, they buy the land. Or when those farmers retire, they buy all their land; their house goes into shambles and they just farm the land, and the government is paying for new barns and more cows being added on and carousel milking systems, and so on and so forth.
        <br>
        <br>Jill: So if that farm, or if the government, goes down - then what happens to those big corporate farms?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:36:04</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:36:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Jill:  Because they've taken out a lot of these small farms around here, to where there's no more small farms milking anymore.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:36:12</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Yeah. Well, I would say they're probably not going to get the government subsidies anymore for sure - but there's also a better way to do this.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:36:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Jill:  Absolutely.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:36:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  And again, this is a faulty structure. Never mind the farms, and them buying up all the farms using government money to do it. Farmers also don't get paid very much when they sell their milk, right? And their cheese and their this and their that.
        <br>
        <br>What if things were done differently and they were done on a forward production contract instead of a subsidy? Meaning, you need to provide milk to, say, the school system, as an example.
        <br>
        <br>And right now, here, at least in this country, we have free public education, and we have lots of subsidy programs that help kids that can't afford to buy lunch, buy lunch and breakfast.
        <br>
        <br>So that being said, what if we were to do a production contract for X amount of liters or gallons of milk per day coming from there rather than subsidizing them, giving them free money to take over other farms? See what I mean?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:37:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Now, if that was available to any farmer, it's not a system; it's basically: [if] you can produce the milk, you can get the forward production.
        <br>
        <br>You would pay for the first year's production up front, so that would give them the ability on a small-farmer level, as an example, to buy that carousel, to buy those extra seeds, to buy all the things that they need to buy.
        <br>
        <br>And then we are paying the same price you would pay at the grocery store for said milk.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:38:04</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Jill:  I also know farmers though, that are truck drivers and they haul milk. And they've been dumping milk for years.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:38:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Yep. Yep, because it's another one of those things, too, where unfortunately, it's all another form of nepotism, isn't it?
        <br>
        <br>You are the government contractor, therefore you get the contracts with Walmart. You get the contracts with the large grocery store chains. They put all of the mom-and-pop grocers out of business.
        <br>
        <br>You can't even choose something different. If you are a restaurant, you lose your distributors.
        <br>
        <br>So it's this whole cycle of creating pinch points and not allowing small businesses to thrive, and then if you weren't out of business before, you were out of business three years ago, you know, or four years ago.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:39:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Jill:  Living in New York State doesn't help either.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:39:10</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Yep.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:39:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Jill:  New York State just puts you right under.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:39:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Yep, I know. I lived in Massachusetts, so taxes, all kinds of different things. Plus, you know...
        <br>
        <br>[Jill interjects...]
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:39:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Jill:  That kind of leads into my second question of: if the federal government goes down, fine and dandy, we don't need them. And as local governments, they're just as bad, if not worse, than some of the federal governments around here. Our taxes are supposed to be due January 20th, but they didn't send them out until February 12th, I believe it was, and then told us we all owe penalties for not paying your taxes on time.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:39:56</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Yeah. Well, my interim - and I'm just going to say interim-wise - because I think the states will go after any federal.
        <br>
        <br>But remember, all of these people that run your states and provinces are all part of that same federal system. So now they all take orders too.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:40:25</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Jill:  So does that mean Hokle the Horrible is going to go down?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:40:29</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  I don't know how quickly it's gonna happen, let me put it that way to you.
        <br>
        <br>You know, you would have better luck as a citizen of New York - and I'm not saying to do this because it's very dangerous - going down to Hell's Kitchen and making a deal with the mafia.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:40:48</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Jill:  Yeah.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:40:49</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Jill:  I mean, you'd pay less.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:40:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Jill:  Well, we live in upstate New York, so we're the forgotten few.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:40:55</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Yeah. Well, you know, it's everywhere in the whole state, isn't it?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:41:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Jill:  Yeah.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:41:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  So. No, I mean, if it were me and I were a business owner in the state of New York, I would sooner go pay the 10% to them.
        <br>
        <br>Say, "Look, you know, I need to keep my business running. What is it going to cost?"
        <br>
        <br>Because you'll pay less taxes. You'll have protection from the government because they tell your government what to do in the state of New York - whether it's the Jewish mafia or the Irish mafia or the Sicilian mafia, that's pretty much who runs New York.
        <br>
        <br>Right, wrong, or indifferent - but that's not to say that in the near future systems will change. Those subsidies will change. The small business owner is going to be able to do well again.
        <br>
        <br>And really, that's why our team has worked ridiculously hard to ensure that you can pick up and drop off from local farms, as an example.
        <br>
        <br>If a farmer is willing to ship, how far are they willing to ship? You know, and we'll tell you all of that right there in their own online shop.
        <br>
        <br>So, you know, there are going to be options in the near future that we don't have - even with Amazons and Etsys and things like that - where you have other ways of sourcing food.
        <br>
        <br>You'll know where your farms are - hopefully we can get as many farmers as possible to join, because that's going to be their bread and butter; it's going to be you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:42:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Jill:  I hate to say it, but there's not a lot of young farmers left out there. They can't afford the farms. They can't afford to farm. When you can't afford the tractors, you can't afford the equipment, you can't afford the seed, and then on top of it the land is a half a million dollars - just to buy 30 acres.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:43:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  But you could if you had a production contract guaranteed for 10 years, and you got your first year's production paid up front.
        <br>
        <br>So you'd have enough, obviously, if a tomato costs you - with seed and fertilizer and land costs and all of that - you know, 20 cents to produce, and you're selling it to me so I can give it to the schools at $3 a tomato or whatever it is - $2 a tomato - then you can now afford to buy all of those things you need.
        <br>
        <br>You could even do other subsidies to get people started with land and that type of thing.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:43:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  The reason why people don't want to be farmers isn't because there aren't... I mean, I'm here in Durango; we have huge ranches everywhere in the area. It looks - well, with maybe a few more mountains - kind of like upstate New York, right?
        <br>
        <br>The reason why people don't farm is because there's no money and they're constantly struggling.
        <br>
        <br>I can pick... I could go downtown and walk around for a little while - these are just regular people - and I could say, "Look, how many people would like to set up a farm?"
        <br>
        <br>You can get all the state-of-the-art equipment. You can go work outside on the land. You know, we're going to have greenhouses we're putting up for the winter. You can farm year-round, all of that kind of thing.
        <br>
        <br>And here's all you really need to do.
        <br>
        <br>All of the schools in New Mexico are going to be supplied with your produce, your cattle, your beef, your this, your that - it's going to be a game changer for farmers.
        <br>
        <br>You know, there are a lot of people that take pride, too, in the fact that their parents farmed and they'd like to farm, but it's just the struggle to keep things going is what makes it difficult.
        <br>
        <br>But we need our farmers. WE need our farmers - Walmart might not care, but WE need our farmers.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:45:19</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Jill:  They're selling off a lot of land for solar when 20 miles down the road is Niagara Falls, and they're only running it at 25%. Yep. My last electric bill - I have a small two-bedroom ranch - my last electric bill was almost $400.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:45:38</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, and are any of these options the most efficient?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:45:48</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Jill:  We have, I have Burt Dam seven miles away, which is crumbling, which could very easily be a hydro. And yet, they're taking farmland to put solar in, where in this neck of the woods there's no, there's not enough sun throughout the year.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:46:09</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, that's part of it. The other thing is, it's extremely inefficient. And why would you want to waste land like that?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:46:15</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Jill:  Well, not only that, but then once they build the solar farms, they change it from a farming zone to commercial zone - and it cannot go back to a farming zone. All of that farmland is now just wasted on solar, and it takes solar over a hundred years to break down.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:46:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Jill, this is Nat. I'm going to move it on, because we've got lots of people waiting, so thank you. For everyone: it's just one question, so we can get through.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:46:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Sorry.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:46:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  No, no worries.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:46:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  That's my fault. Yeah, yeah. No, it's a big thing for me. Really, truly it is, because, you know, they've screwed up our food so badly and have screwed our farmers over terribly. So, I mean, that's a big one for me. So, we have to create a better system. And I have been having conversations with a farmer from upstate New York from time to time when I have time as well. And he's telling me about all the problems.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:47:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Jill:  Thank you for your time.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:47:25</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Thank you, Jill.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:47:26</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Thank you, Jill. Thank you, Kim. Now the next person is Karen Cook. Karen? Do you know how to unmute? Let's unmute Karen.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:47:45</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Karen?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:47:47</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Karen:  I'm here. How are you? Oh, I promise [I'm here]! Do you hear me?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:47:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  I can.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:47:59</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Karen:  Oh, yay. Oh, thank you so much, Kim, for taking my call. I think the hardest challenge is the questions. I have so many. So the one that is in my mind right now is just the Social Security - because I'm on Social Security - and there are so many things that I'm hearing in different places: that we won't be able to access it. Is there any truth in that? Because that's a little concerning.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:48:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, and again, some of the essential services are going to have to stay the way they are for now. We just don't rely on the government to pay it, that's all.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:48:47</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Karen:  So then I will, we, because I represent a whole, I'm a retired teacher, so I represent a lot of people. So we will still be able to get our Social Security check?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:48:59</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  You'll be able to get Social Security because that's the database that's easy to access through FISERV. The other thing that's not quite as easy is pensions.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:49:10</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Karen:  Oh no! The teacher's pension?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:49:13</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Because it would have to be a situation where we would have to take a look at - and that's all government pensions, really. Because they all - every state runs them through someone or somebody different - so it's not a centralized database.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:49:35</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Karen:  Okay.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:49:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  So, it would have to be a thing where we would create some kind of an outlet, where people could go and say, "Look, this is my pension, here's my letter." And then we figure out a way to compensate those people in a way that at least they're used to, or maybe a little bit better, until Essentials is fully running.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:50:00</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Karen:  Okay, so, right now this month - is it safe?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:50:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Oh yeah, you're fine.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:50:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Karen:  Okay. Okay. I'm living day by day, so thank you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:50:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Karen:  I'm pretty sure... I think that it's going to take some time for them to fully - their ego is too big.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:50:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Karen:  Okay.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:50:25</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  You know, and yeah, I don't think they're... I'm surprised that they were messing about a little bit with veterans pay, to be honest with you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:50:38</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Karen:  Yes, I know. My friend is a veteran. Yes, I know exactly what you're talking about.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:50:43</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Yeah?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:50:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Karen:  Yes. So, okay, thank you so much for taking my call. I really appreciate you answering my questions and giving me peace of mind.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:50:54</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  I gave them a solution on what to do.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:50:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Karen:  You did?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:50:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Yeah, I mean, I tell you, our military - once you're out, then nobody seems to give a crap.
        <br>
        <br>Because I said, "Look, you know, you have a veterans bank. Why are you not using it? Why can't we just transfer money directly to there? You make sure all the veterans are paid. Everything goes smooth."
        <br>
        <br>And then everybody just looked at me like, "Oh." You know?
        <br>
        <br>Aahh - you can't even talk to these people about the simplest thing. Even if I told them I would give them 50% to the government and give 50% to the veterans to make sure they got their pay - or teachers, to make sure they got their pensions - they would screw it up. Every time.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:51:43</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Karen:  Wow.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:51:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Sorry to be blunt, but just like, you know.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:51:47</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Karen:  I appreciate truth. Believe me. You can be as blunt as you need to be. That's what I want to hear.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:51:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  It's terrible, really.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:51:54</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Karen:  I agree. I agree. If there's anything that I can do, you know, whatever, you know, organize a group or anything that can help you in any way, I offer my services. And you don't have to be...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:52:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Honestly, no, there would be no better education for our teachers that are coming into the workforce in the future than to have your wisdom and your experience.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:52:25</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Karen:  Like a consultant.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:52:28</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Yeah. Whereas, as part of their degree, they'd be required to spend time, you know, with someone like you that's going to tell it like it is. Because everything you learn when you're getting your degree is nothing like it really is, right?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:52:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Karen:  For sure. That's for sure. Yeah.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:52:46</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  And I think we'd end up with better teachers in the long run if that actually happens.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:52:52</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Karen:  Well, I appreciate that. That's something I will look into.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:52:56</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  OK.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:52:57</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Karen:  OK. Thank you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:52:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Thank you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:52:59</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Karen:  All right. Have a great night.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:53:00</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  You too. Bye.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:53:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Thanks, Karen. Thanks, Kim. Kim, the next person is Carmen... Singe... Sinke...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:53:09</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Carmen:  Singe.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:53:09</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Carmen.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:53:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Carmen:  Hi. Thank you so much for all you do these days. My question is about the medical system and health system - how it's going to be reshaped and how it's going to survive this transition.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:53:29</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Are you talking about the current allopathic?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:53:34</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Carmen:  No, I'm talking about the people who are depending on a lot of medication, which is from big pharma, and things like this.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:53:45</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Yeah, well, and I've said this before, and even from the beginning. So it's going to take us a little bit of time to get Essentials everywhere. There's not a lot of infrastructure around the world for these types of payment systems. So it's going to take a little bit of time to do that, and to roll it out.
        <br>
        <br>We have a plan. We have all of the ways to do it. We have all the companies that can provide us with the service - but we're not going to be able to use the larger companies. That's the problem.
        <br>
        <br>We have to use smaller startup companies and the like because the others are just - it's just not going to work. I've tried. I have tried. It didn't matter how much I paid them for services - I have tried. So, as far as medicine is concerned, my biggest concern is that 80%-ish, give or take - maybe even more - of the medication for the entire planet comes out of China.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:54:59</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Carmen:  Wow.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:54:59</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  That's my bigger, immediate concern. So we do not have - and this is why I call them Duck Dynasty and other four-letter words on the daily - because they have no forethought, nor do they care, I guess.
        <br>
        <br>You know, we don't have the infrastructure here in the States to manufacture, in mass, for example, insulin or heart medication or even antidepressants. I mean, if you go - if you are on that stuff and you just don't have it anymore, it causes you a lot of issues - it's meant to be a dependent drug, right?
        <br>
        <br>And I'm not... you know, whatever people choose that works for their own selves is what they choose. We currently don't have something that we are 100% sure works for - for example, to make your pancreas produce insulin the way it's supposed to. We don't have that.
        <br>
        <br>Are there possibilities in theoretical and in vivo studies and things like that? Yes. There's lots of them. But we currently don't have that available.
        <br>
        <br>So what are we... [Screen goes white.] I don't know what she's doing here.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:56:21</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  So what are we going to do? The answer to the question is that, even when Essentials picks up things, then it's going to cover both.
        <br>
        <br>And that was the thing that drove the person who is not here anymore - you know who I mean - a little crazy. Because if someone - it's about freedom, it's about medical freedom, it's the freedom to choose.
        <br>
        <br>So, if you feel comfortable with this way of doing things - and remember, there are billions of people out there that still think naturopathic medicine is all about meditating and sniffing oils or something - they don't understand the science behind it. So they've been on this medication their whole life, and they think it works for them.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:57:15</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  It's going to take some time - and a lot of education - to get people to understand that there are options. And then, even if they are presented with options, what then? How long does it take to get off that medication and try something else? And how do you make that transition?
        <br>
        <br>We don't have all the data on anything like that, and it's going to take time to do that.
        <br>
        <br>So to answer your question, "Are insurance companies on a rocky road?"
        <br>
        <br>Yeah, they're on a very slippery slope and rocky road right now. And that's partially due to the Frank Dodd Act [Dodd-Frank Act] because they have been wrapping a lot of these government IOUs that the banks have been receiving and that kind of thing. You know, another, the California situation has taken a big hit on the insurance companies.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:58:12</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  But the thing that you don't probably know is that there is something called the Insurance Guarantee Fund.
        <br>
        <br>So, interim-wise, so to speak, if it's government stuff, that's easy. Because again - it might be an antiquated database, but it's still a database - and they centralize everything.
        <br>
        <br>So it's going to be easy to get, like, Medicare and those types of things out, or if they have the VA, that kind of thing. That's easy - those are all databases.
        <br>
        <br>But as far as the regular insurance companies, you know, they have a Guarantee Fund. I will say that. You can look it up. It's not made public because it's kind of like their self-funded insurance pool, so to speak, that they have to pay into should an insurance company go bankrupt.
        <br>
        <br>So there's definitely backups there. They're not allowed to use it unless they officially declare bankruptcy, and then it's out there. So that will still buy a little bit more time.
        <br>
        <br>I'm just looking forward to where people can choose.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:59:30</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Okay, thank you. Elizabeth J. is next.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:59:37</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Hi, Elizabeth.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:59:38</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Elizabeth:  Hi, Kim. Thanks for using this platform. It feels like old times.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:59:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  I know.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:59:43</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Elizabeth:  2018, 2019... It's nice. It's been a while. I have a lot of questions, but I think I'm going to ask you about, in respect to the reversing of the electron spin, which you said started a few days ago.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:59:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Yeah.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:59:59</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Elizabeth:  So, what is it that humans can expect to feel? And is this the anti-death program that you were talking about, that allows us to heal and rejuvenate? Can you expand on that a little bit?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:00:15</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, it's all the way down to a mitochondrial level. It's something that we were working on a lot even earlier today, and we worked on it quite a bit over the last few days.
        <br>
        <br>Because energy has a natural flow to it. And energy and frequency pretty much move everything in your body. And it's not just your body - it's also Earth's body, its plants, its everything.
        <br>
        <br>And when you're trying, your energy is trying to go in this direction [motioning counterclockwise], and it's being pushed or pulled in the other direction [motioning clockwise] - it's what causes all kinds of genetic abnormalities. And then we've got environmental things on top of it that aren't very healthy for us too.
        <br>
        <br>The changing of the flow to a more natural flow - the way that it always was before they did all this stuff to us - is going to eventually get us from the death program and into a much longer life.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:01:39</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Have we, that are living here now, sustained a lot of damage due to everything they've done to us? Yes. I mean, for sure.
        <br>
        <br>The technology is out there to where we can help and repair in a natural way, a more holistic way. And I know everybody talks about medbeds, and I hate that - because it's not that simple. It's not that easy, and it's not going to work for everybody, either - at least the real ones. But there's a lot of things that people portray as a medbed-type device that is not what I know it to be either.
        <br>
        <br>So, I definitely think it's going to help quite a bit. I know for myself, I've noticed I have a lot more energy in the last couple of days, the last day or so. Less disturbances, so that's good. I feel everything that's going on.
        <br>
        <br>Then, hopefully, definitely, I would say that the humans - having no access to any of that stuff to mess with us - is really, really important. I was very high up on the food chain here, because they were definitely trying for like the last, oh God, since the end of October. Anything that they could find.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:03:09</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Elizabeth:  Yeah, well, thank you. I've been actually trying a new protocol, so it's hard to tell what's working because I try so many things at once - and you know when that happens, you're like, "Well is it this, or is it that?" So I'm using methylene blue but with a CBD - with no THC, but just the CBD - and infrared light therapy. It's Dr. Jack Cruz's - he's a brain surgeon. It's his protocol. And so I feel much more energetic, but I'm wondering, like, I'm wondering which - what is it? And so... but everything helps.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:03:39</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Everything helps, yeah. And not everything works for everybody, either.
        <br>
        <br>You know, it's a funny story, to tell you real quickly. I had an opportunity - and I call it an opportunity because I don't get them very often on Saturday to take a little time. I took my dog out to this farm not that far from here, and we got some groceries, that type of thing.
        <br>
        <br>And then I ended up going to my favorite tea store in town. So, I'm a big tea fan of all sorts, but you know a lot of it's medicinal too. You know, like, my lemon balm takes away stress. I have these different teas for different things, and then of course I use the oils, sometimes - I'll add a little oil in there too. But so I - there's a tea that they make; it's like a chocolate-coconut tea, but it's a mate, and it's a pu-erh tea.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:04:34</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  So it's got a lot of health benefits, a lot of digestive benefits - and it gives you energy, but not crazy coffee-type energy.
        <br>
        <br>So I started feeling more energy, you know. I was all excited; I was telling a friend. She's like, "Well, I don't have your tea, and I have more energy." And I'm like, "Oh, okay... so it wasn't the tea..." I thought here, I'm like, "Wow, I forgot how good this makes me feel because I haven't been able to get it in a while."
        <br>
        <br>And I was like, "Oh - it wasn't the tea!" [hearty laughter] It was the energy. So, I don't know. You know, maybe it's a little bit of both, right?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:05:09</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Thank you. The next person, Kim, is Elsaby. Okay.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:05:17</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Hi, Elsaby.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:05:26</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Elsaby:  Hi, Kim. Can you hear me?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:05:28</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  I can hear you!
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:05:29</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Elsaby:  Oh, good. As long as you can hear me, you don't have to see me. I'm from New Zealand. And I am really concerned about how we're going to put into effect all the things we need to do for C.A.R.E. in New Zealand. How is it going to work? Because the USA is a very long way away. Everything's a long way away from New Zealand. For instance, all your oils and the alternative minerals and all these things are irradiated when they come into our country, so they become useless. So we can't even get...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:06:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Not mine.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:06:15</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Elsaby:  Are you sure? Are you absolutely sure?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:06:19</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Because that's the reason why we have the glass where it doesn't penetrate.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:06:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Elsaby:  Ah, that's right.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:06:25</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  See, I'm smart like that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:06:28</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Elsaby:  I know you're smart, darling. I know you're smart.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:06:31</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, and we're working on some skin care too that's all herbal and botanical that I've been working hard on too - very hard - in my spare couple hours a day that I can knock it out. And there's a whole microbial testing thing that has to happen, all that kind of stuff too, just to make sure we're doing great things.
        <br>
        <br>But all of those go into that glass too. The name of the company that makes the glass is Miron. M-I-R-O-N. You can look them up.
        <br>
        <br>They specifically created it to be a preservative unto itself as well - because it doesn't let in radiation from the sun. It only lets in positive sun rays. So it, in theory, blocks the radiation.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:07:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Elsaby:  Okay, that's wonderful. Are we still talking?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:07:29</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  We are still talking.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:07:31</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Elsaby:  Oh, well, that's okay. Also, how I would love to set up a C.A.R.E. hub here, where we can start educating people in the Essentials and all of the things that we're going to be doing. But I don't know how it's going to work. I don't know if you've been thinking about how all this is going to work.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:07:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, you also have to remember too that every place is different.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:07:56</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Elsaby:  Yes, I know.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:07:57</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  It is one place in the world I haven't actually been. So, I couldn't tell you how it's going to work there - you're going to have to tell me how it's going to work there.
        <br>
        <br>In other words, what I mean is I understand your systems. I understand that your government is crazy. I mean, I get that. For a while there it was really crazy, like super crazy.
        <br>
        <br>But, I know somewhat of the resources from there. So, I would say... you're going to have to - or people like you, or the people of New Zealand - are going to have to tell us what your challenges are, and how you think it would be best to solve those challenges. Because having not lived there, it's hard for anybody else to do it for you. It would be wrong to try to do it for you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:09:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Elsaby:  I've already drawn up a whole program on the hub. I was going to submit it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:09:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Yeah. And it would be great to share it with other people in New Zealand, too.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:09:19</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Elsaby:  Yes.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:09:20</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  I think that would be most beneficial first so you could get everybody's input on, you know, the plan, what they think, or what they could add to it. Maybe they could say, oh look, that's a great idea. Why don't we add this? Or can we do that in how many places at the same time?
        <br>
        <br>And then once you come up with everything, I mean, it's good to even start doing something there. And then at that time - that way, when C.A.R.E. is available in your area - then it can grow faster.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:09:54</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Elsaby:  Yes, that's the intention. And we can. Because we're a small place, we can do things very quickly if we work together.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:10:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Absolutely.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:10:04</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Elsaby:  If we work together.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:10:06</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Okay, thank you so much.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:10:06</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Elsaby:  Thank you very much - and thank you so much for what you do.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:10:10</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Thank you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:10:10</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Elsaby:  Bye, darling.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:10:12</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Bye, dear.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:10:12</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Now, Kim, before we continue, how tired are you? Would you like to do one more question? Would you like to do a couple more questions? How are you feeling?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:10:29</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Ummm, I mean, I could probably do... let's do a couple more, and then we will do this again. So, if we don't catch you this time, we are going to - now that we kind of got it going - we definitely will do this again.
        <br>
        <br>So the other thing we can do, Nat, is we can create a thread in the community chat where maybe you guys can pick up some of those questions, and then I can try to get a few answered every day. If you'd like to do that, we could do something like that too.
        <br>
        <br>And then we'll do this again, you know, obviously next month, if not before.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:11:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Yeah, thank you, Kim. So we're going to do two more. And that's going to be Veronica Saunders and Nicole. Everybody else - I'm so sorry - I can see there's lots of people with their hands up. However, we will do this again, and we will provide some way for you to pop your questions, and when Kim's got time, she can then quickly answer them.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:11:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  So we're going to start with Veronica. So Veronica and Nicole, just so Kim can get to bed tonight, can you just make it really succinct? Thank you. So Veronica first.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:11:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Veronica:  Hi. Hi, Kim. Thank you so much for...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:11:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Oh, did I lose her?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:11:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  No. She's just on mute again. Veronica's still muted, so let's try and unmute her.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:12:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Okay. Oh, I just lost everybody. Oh, dear.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:12:10</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Kim, we can hear you. We can hear you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:12:12</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Oh, you can hear me still? Okay.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:12:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Yes, we can hear you. We can hear you. Veronica, Please go ahead.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:12:17</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Veronica:  Can you hear me? Okay. Again, Kim, for the amazing work you do - that's beyond words - very appreciated. I have a question about HAARP, the weather control and monitoring system. I don't know exactly what that stands for. Will this system run on the Golden Age AI in the future? Will it have less extreme weather patterns than we are experiencing? Or will there be other benefits to the Golden Age AI that will regulate the control system - this weather control system that we are under?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:12:56</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, HAARP is a front. There are many other weather control and element control and air control and oxygen control and... Most of those programs were not run by DARPA or the government. They were far more detrimental, with a completely different agenda, and there was probably at least 50, if not more, holograms specifically geared towards weather control, if not more.
        <br>
        <br>So HAARP is kind of a limited government access or Deep State access program, which allowed them to do certain limited things.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:13:54</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  The other control systems and the holograms related to them are pretty well gone, I hope. But I would say that, no, it won't run on a Golden Age AI.
        <br>
        <br>But there has to be a certain amount of change - just like all the other changes we talked about - where we start going back to more natural weather patterns. We didn't actually have weather as a planet a long time ago. We didn't have rain and snow and all that kind of stuff. We had a natural humidity to the air.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:14:40</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Veronica:  Great, thank you. So will that all harmonize more with the weather, let's say? Will we have the hurricanes, the strong wind? I live in Las Vegas, and I noticed there's less strong winds - we didn't really have as much rain this season, this winter season. So I guess my question is, is the weather going to be - also the water, you mentioned something about the living water, Source water, that's hidden in the earth that will eventually come out throughout the entire planet. Can you see some changes? How long will it take until this living water will penetrate the 'globe distance' and help, you know, create a better environment for us?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:15:31</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well right now we can clean and they can muddy. So, we can fix, and they muddy. We fix; they muddy. It doesn't take much to contaminate water. I mean, farms with the wrong type of pesticides near a water supply or an aquifer can destroy water for miles. So there are a lot of cleanup efforts that have to happen.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:15:56</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  It's not that we can't create water with the proper molecular structure. But in the interim, there are lots of options for you to charge water - you can plasma charge water, and that's better than not doing anything, let's just say.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:16:17</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Veronica:  Okay, but overall, the weather - it will get better? Like you said, the systems are gone.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:16:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Yeah, it's going to take time to do that too, though. You've got to remember, you know, nature is nature.
        <br>
        <br>If we decide we need not to have the San Andreas Fault anymore, then we need to figure out what to do there, right? And then, how do we do that without disturbing the Teutonic plates, and how do we do that without disturbing the people that live around there? And how do you do that when it comes to water supplies and things like that?
        <br>
        <br>So, we have a lot of wrongs - and I keep saying this to people - and it's going to take a lot of rights. It's going to involve everybody. But as far as them spraying chemicals in the air, and no matter how many times we destroy reservoirs of that stuff, they still get out there - and I have them here too. And that affects our water supply as well.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:17:26</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Veronica:  Okay, yeah, of course it does. Yeah, absolutely. Thank you so much, Kim.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:17:30</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Thank you. One more. Nicole. And then Kim will say goodbye to us, and we'll say goodbye after Nicole's question, and then we'll see each other again. Thanks, Kim. Thanks, Nicole.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:17:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nicole:  Hi Kim, I can't see you. Can you hear me?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:17:48</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  I can see you. I can hear you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:17:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nicole:  Okay, I can see you. Hi, how are you?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:17:52</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Good. How are you?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:17:54</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nicole:  Good. I just have a question - because I know you're not a big fan of channeling, but I do listen to some channelers. And they mostly are positive, but a lot of them talk about the "flash of light" or something, some big event. Is that kind of what you allude to? Or are they picking up on that? Or is that just like another, I don't know...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:18:17</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, so when I say "channeling," you know - I don't think it's necessary to invite a being to take over your person and speak through you. That I don't agree with - and usually that's nothing positive.
        <br>
        <br>If it's a positive thing, then they could be having a conversation, you know, a more telepathic conversation with a being somewhere. So, that is different. I mean, we, a lot of people do that. You know, it's just a phone conversation without the phone. That's all.
        <br>
        <br>And we do that with each other a lot, too, from time to time. Whether you know it or not, you can feel the person's energy next to you, that kind of thing. And they just have a unique talent of putting that into words.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:19:15</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  So, I don't want you to think that I'm saying, "Oh, everybody who says 'I channel' is bad," because I don't think they realize that they're just having a conversation sometimes, some of those people.
        <br>
        <br>As far as a big flash of light in the world changing, you know - I don't know. And really, if I was going to say anything to that effect: I haven't heard that yet.
        <br>
        <br>But you never know with Source. He's pretty funny, so, you know, it's possible. [chuckling]
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:19:43</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nicole:  Interesting. Okay.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:19:45</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  With Source, anything is possible. I've seen some crazy things happen, that's for sure. And I'm like, "Oh, well, it would have been nice to do that three years ago." Or, that would have been great, you know, work your magic.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:20:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nicole:  It's interesting because as far as I know - the collective consciousness - and if so many people are getting similar messages and we're technically co-creating, would that be something, yeah - because all of these people are picking up on that? Because we are co-creators?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:20:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Sure, and some people are really sensitive too, and they could see that flash of light, and other people probably wouldn't see anything. So, it just really depends on the person.
        <br>
        <br>But I definitely think you can co-create the space for sure. If everybody is getting a similar message that we're about to embark on a big change - remember something too: We can all see the same movie, and [yet] that doesn't mean we're all going to pick up the same things from the movie.
        <br>
        <br>You know, someone might say, "Oh my God, did you see that lady's hair?"
        <br>
        <br>"I couldn't believe he ran out the door."
        <br>
        <br>And they'd be like, "He didn't run out the door, he got into the garage."
        <br>
        <br>"No, no, he ran out the front door."
        <br>
        <br>You know? So, we don't pick up on things the same way sometimes. But generally speaking, we'll all probably start to feel something different. That's my opinion.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:21:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nicole:  Okay. Thank you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:21:26</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  But it's always good to listen to positive messages from people rather than listen to Orange People yell at you. [laughing]
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:21:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nicole:  I don't - yeah, I try to do more of a spiritual versus... And again, I'm like, these could be the CIA, you know? People that are implanted to like give you an idea in your head, and... anyway.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:21:47</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  You know, you'd know. So, you've got to listen to them from within, you know. And if it feels funny to you or it starts to feel funny at any point, don't listen. You know, if it feels like it's right, and they're good people, then keep listening to those people.
        <br>
        <br>But I know a lot of people too that, you know, I started like, "Oh, well, that sounds really good," and then somewhere along the way, their whole message changed - and it was weird. And I'm like, "Oh, there's another one."
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:22:22</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nicole:  Well, I definitely make sure - because when you talked about the "they do a little bit of truth and then sandwich it in a lot of lies" - so, I try to look for that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:22:34</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Yeah.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:22:34</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nicole:  But yeah, it's kind of hard. There's just so much; it's like, overload. So my rule generally would be, if it's like fear-based - mostly - I kind of tune out.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:22:49</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  So, what about listening to you? What do you think?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:22:54</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nicole:  That's a great point. [laughing] I mean, I feel like things are changing, but I think you always kind of want a validation, and I guess maybe I'm not as confident as...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:23:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  No, I mean, and everybody goes through that too, you know, where you're just starting to get your feet wet in the water and you're seeing things or you're feeling things and you're like, did I really see that? Did that really happen? And if so, who do I ask, or who do I talk to about it? You know?
        <br>
        <br>And then you need that almost validation of what you're doing because you want to make sure that like you're seeing the right things, you're hearing the right things.
        <br>
        <br>But I would also ask for that. Because there have been times where I'm doing this and I'm like - especially in the beginning - I'm like, "Are you kidding me right now?" Three days out of 10, I'd wake up going, "Okay, I've just lost it. Yep, yep, it's gone."
        <br>
        <br>And then, something would happen where I'm like, "Okay, that really just happened - it really happened."
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:24:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  You know, I'd get a phone call from someone, or they said, "Oh, this is what the government just did," or, you know, something like that.
        <br>
        <br>And I'd be like, "Oh my God! Okay... That just happened."
        <br>
        <br>So, there are ways you can also ask for validation of what you're hearing and you're seeing, and then something will come up - you'll get a phone call. You'll catch a glimpse of something, you know, on the internet where they repeat the exact same words you heard. You know, that kind of thing, too.
        <br>
        <br>So that - it does help. But it does take time sometimes to really learn to trust yourself. But also, maybe try to find people around you that are like you. You know, there's always...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:24:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nicole:  Yeah, but I don't want to get into, like, the echo chamber thing either. Like, I want it to be true - real - not, "Oh, I see all of these things because... so I try to use my discernment, and I think I'm pretty good. But, yeah.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:25:15</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Yeah. Just reach out to Source and say, "Hey, I feel like this is happening," you know, and then sometimes it comes overnight; sometimes it's a thought first thing in the morning kind of thing.
        <br>
        <br>And, you know, learning to trust that and just say, "Oh my gosh, could this be real?"
        <br>
        <br>And then maybe you'll see it presented by a person you don't know, a male or a female or something.
        <br>
        <br>And then you're on the train, and you see that person doing that thing - drinking that coffee, reading that paper, or whatever it is. And then you'll know.
        <br>
        <br>How would you know ahead of time? Because that happened to me a number of times too. I'd get, like, a vision of something simple.
        <br>
        <br>So, if all that, the rest of that, if that's true - that guy on the train with the paper and the coffee, you know, from that particular coffee shop - it has happened.
        <br>
        <br>Then all the rest of the things I saw must be true and real, because how would I know?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:26:19</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Okay. Yeah, that makes sense.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:26:20</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  So sometimes I look for things like that, in the very beginning, for validation that I'm really not - you know, that this is real.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:26:31</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Okay. Awesome. Thank you so much.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:26:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Thank you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:26:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Thank you, Nicole. What a lovely way to end. Lovely way to end, Kim. So, I'll just hand over to Kim to say goodbye.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>03:26:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  So, that being said, I wanted to thank every single one of you for coming tonight.
        <br>
        <br>I appreciate you - I love having chats with you.
        <br>
        <br>And I know a lot of you mentioned that you wanted to try a Zoom. I think we did okay for our first time in a really long time, and I look forward to answering all your questions and talking with you more.
        <br>
        <br>For me, it's so enjoyable to talk to all of you because I get to see you and it's better than just me talking at a computer or talking at a camera.
        <br>
        <br>So, it's lovely for me to meet all of you, sometimes for the first time. Some of you I've seen before and talked to before; you've been around for a long time.
        <br>
        <br>So I just wanted to say I appreciate all of you.
        <br>
        <br>And maybe next time we'll do it at a different hour, so that we can catch different time zones and that type of thing too.
        <br>
        <br>So, we're working on it. And we're definitely working through it, and hopefully - Source willing - we'll have more time to do these types of things in the future as well.
        <br>
        <br>I have missed seeing you guys every Sunday, I can tell you that.
        <br>
        <br>So, big hugs to all of you too, and we will see you - I guess today's Monday - so I'll see you on Wednesday.
        <br>
