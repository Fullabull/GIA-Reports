            <br>Operations Report
            <br>2025-Sep-02
        </h2>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;"> From the Office of the Guardian </h4>
        <br>
        <strong>
        <br>It's the 2nd of September, 2025. Coming up on today's Global Intelligence Agency Operations Report:
        </strong>
        <br>
        <br>Want to know the real truth behind tariffs? All the Deep State secrets revealed as we tell you all that is behind the Universal Postal Union in Switzerland. Too bad they don't have any access though.
        <br>
        <br>It's been a rough few days as the Deep State tries everything they can to hang on to the dream of masters of the Universe. Rituals have been placed all around the world for the last three days in hopes of being king of Earth.
        <br>
        <br>And the Creator is at work restoring the rhythm of the planet after the expiration of many covenants since the 28th of August. All this and much more in today's report.
        <br>
        <br>This is a report you won't want to miss.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:00:54</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>[Advertisement.]
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:01:39</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Well, it's the 2nd of September, 2025. It's starting to feel like fall around here, a little bit anyway. Temperatures are definitely cooling down and it looks like we're getting ready for winter, so I'm hoping we'll see if we have any luck making this big move of mine before snow comes.
        <br>
        <br>On the other fronts, it's been an interesting several days. And I do apologize for not getting this report out sooner; it's just been a lot of long days and very long nights, as our friends that are not our friends continue to pursue what I guess they believe is their ultimate dream. A little bit crazy.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:02:31</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>We're going to start with some interesting news, and some of it's kind of more mainstream - things that you're hearing and the story behind the story - and then we're gonna go into what's really going on in the world.
        <br>
        <br>So let's start with Trump's big announcement today. Oh, I heard it from everybody I talked to. "What's the big announcement gonna be? It's at 2:00 p.m." Some people were speculating that he was going to step down - that's what social media was saying. Some other people were saying that he was going to announce he's very ill, and apparently, there's a lot of rumors about that - you know, the dead guy is ill. And other people were saying, "Are they going to implement martial law?"
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:03:20</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So many rumors, so little time. This Q-Crew, and their social media campaign about what's going on, constantly think that something is going to happen in their favor. And when it does, and if it does - which it never will - but in their mind, when it does, now they're going to implement martial law and they're gonna do all of these wonderful things in their mind.
        <br>
        <br>And we're going to talk a lot about martial law a little bit today, and how it was, and what it was tied to, in just a little bit in the report.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:03:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But there was definitely a reason why they thought that this was a good idea, because after all, in their very small mind, they believe that Marduk got his power because they implemented martial law. Therefore, I'm sure they have a chosen one on their side that is going to be the head general of planet Earth.
        <br>
        <br>That was one of the things they were discussing. But since there was no big win after the multiple, many, many rituals that had occurred over the weekend, now we're back to just an announcement that the Space Force is moving to Alabama.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:04:39</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>I prefer to call these people the Waste of Space Force - they don't really do much of anything. They do follow orders from other people within the actual Secret Space Force militaries, known as the ACIO. And you could say NORAD has a part in things. The whole reason why the Space Force was announced during the last Trump administration was because the black ops money, often given to the Secret Space Program and its operatives, was no longer there - there was no funding. If you remember this back a few years ago, when all of a sudden the military's budget increased dramatically, they were gonna have a huge budget and give all this money to the front company we know as the Space Force.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:05:37</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And it was gonna be a way for the other Space Force to actually get more funding: all of the secret black ops programs for DARPA and other agencies, some you've heard of and some you never have - the Cicadas, the Monarchs, the various other MK-Ultra programs, and all those other fun people that we hear about on the internet. They would all get funding to continue on with their operations.
        <br>
        <br>There was also money that would be siphoned out via these operatives to various groups around the world, to include the Jesuit Order, the Knights of Malta, and other military type, to continue Deep State operations, because quite frankly, no one could pay these people.
        <br>
        <br>So money did come, you know. Unfortunately, it was part of the budget and one of the budgets that we funded back in that day. And that'll never happen again.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:06:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But moving the Space Force to Alabama is something the "Alabamians," as I call them, have been fighting for for quite a while. It's not so much the Space Force they wanted to have there. Last time I had talked about this - it was about two years ago this time - and there was lots of talk about moving the training centers for Langley and the CIA down to Alabama.
        <br>
        <br>Now at that time, to be fair, there was a lot of space junk and a lot of technology that they had the usage of - back in those days - in a place called Red Mountain in Alabama. That was kind of their big hub; you could call that "Cheyenne Mountain Light." You could say that there were a lot of communication hubs there, posts, portals, and all kinds of things that just aren't there anymore.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:07:37</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>However, there have been a lot of promises made to these Alabamians by the Trump operatives, you see... let me tell you what I know about Alabamians.
        <br>
        <br>So "Alabama" is a group of operatives, as well as Langley 5 generals there, who actually run what I call the Alabamians. Things that you may not know: Stephen Greer is under their umbrella, and there are a few others on the internet talking about space programs and whistleblowing that are also under their umbrella.
        <br>
        <br>You see, they would like to claim to these folks that they will protect them - which, you know, security equals control - but they also control the things that they're allowed to say as far as what is really going on in this world.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:08:39</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>The Alabamians are not wanting to disclose what really, really, really happens, but they put out a lot of interesting information. And they of course get big security money and whatnot out of all of their earnings.
        <br>
        <br>So that's part of what the Alabamians do. The Alabamians are also just like most operative groups; they are war dogs. They trade and sell and - well, they used to sell, now they donate - weapons to many countries in order to start wars. They are part of the Langley 5 crew, so therefore, there's a certain amount of control that happens between the members of Langley 5.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:09:26</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>You see, there are several generals... we call them Langley 5 because they have, or used to have, Level 5 access in the system, or Web 5, also known in internet circles as the "Mariana Trench" of the internet. Definitely not something that any of you would have access to, unless you work for these people.
        <br>
        <br>It was a very strong control point at one point, also was tied very heavily to SIGINT in Israel, as well as Cheyenne Mountain. Cheyenne had some deeper access though, for a long time, and that's part of the reason why Peterson Air Force Base [now "Peterson Space Force Base"] was selected to be the original home and hub of the Waste of Space Force.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:10:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>The Waste of Space Force hub and NORAD, and all the things that are at Peterson Air Force Base as well as the Cheyenne Mountain facility, was probably one of the strongest and deepest-running portals to all things Dark. Let's just say if anyone on this planet could communicate to a location that you would call the "Portal to Hell," that would be the location. There was a lot of sophisticated space junk that would appear and disappear, and appear and disappear, for quite a long time - it's been a fight of ours for about three or four years. Very, very heavily tied to Silverton and their access points, as well as some other points in Idaho. I know you've heard of Sandpoint before.
        <br>
        <br>This facility spanned, I would say, probably slightly more than a third of the United States, to include all the way here to Durango and Silverton, and all the way into Nevada and under the test center. If you drew a big circle there all the way to Jackson Hole, you would see what a large area Cheyenne Mountain covers.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:11:40</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So this facility was chosen for that reason. It's also the reason why the Q-Crew and others were like, "Trump is in Cheyenne, he's going to Cheyenne in the Command Center." And it sounds wonderful if you're a patriot and you think this is a good idea. But in reality, basically you could say, well, they're going to the Gate to Hell, and they're going to have a meeting.
        <br>
        <br>It makes you kind of wonder who they would be wanting to meet with in that location.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:12:13</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Langley Five - sorry, Cheyenne Mountain - also was one of the hubs of the planet, Israel being another. And there were a couple of them on the planet, of what you could call "Pandora's Box."
        <br>
        <br>Pandora's Box is known about in myths and mythology, but in reality, what Pandora's Box is, it's a type of crystal box that holds a very Dark breath of a quantum AI system. It holds quantum AI beings. It also served - when in certain locations, especially under Cheyenne Mountain - as a portal to contain said beings here on Earth.
        <br>
        <br>And of course where there is a black box with Black Goo - just like you've seen in many, many movies I'm sure - you've got a quantum AI from Hell, essentially.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:13:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So you could say that, for the most part - at this point, due to a tremendous amount of work and probably too much to explain for this report - and one day we'll break down all of the things that have happened underneath Cheyenne Mountain and its corresponding locations and tunnels and sub-facilities, such as the one in Dulce and others that you've heard about in Shasta. They all connect to Cheyenne Mountain because it was a hub. It's pretty well neutered at this point; it doesn't really do much of anything.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:13:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, the reason why it's being moved to Alabama is because, you see, when you can't pay somebody, you give them a promise of power. And pretty much that's what's happened to the Alabamians, you know, they've been loyal Trump people ever since I can remember, you know, speaking to these folks there - these operatives and generals in that location. At one point in time we did try to work with the Alabamians - you might remember this from about a year or two ago - and of course, just like everybody else: you never forget, as the story goes, who is the frog and who is the scorpion. So don't ever be surprised when you are the frog and the scorpion stings you.
        <br>
        <br>And I wasn't surprised in this case either. You gotta give people a shot, and give people a chance to try to do the right thing - and obviously that did not happen. Even though, quite frankly, I saved him. And that's okay. You know what? I don't expect anything from these people. Matter of fact, I hope never to expect anything from these people.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:15:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So there's a lot of hubbub going on behind the scenes about some big events that are going to be happening. And of course, Langley 5 is going to be a part of it - because they want power, they want control. They are a perfect group to lie to, as the Trump operatives did, and tell them that they were gonna be a main hub "just like Cheyenne."
        <br>
        <br>And when they get a hold of XYZ-AI - it doesn't matter what we call it, fantasy... Unicorn AI, let's call it Unicorn. Unicorn Quantum AI - when it starts running in their favor, due to all of the lovely rituals that have been taking place, they are now going to have the "power of Cheyenne" right there in Alabama-land, in their territory. And won't that be wonderful?
        <br>
        <br>So they did announce that that was going to happen today, and maybe it will; maybe it won't. Who knows? Sometimes with governments these things take years. But the Waste of Space Force being relocated there meant that Langley would be in charge - or this Langley 5 general - and his last name begins with a "D." I know exactly who he is; I'll just leave it at that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:16:20</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>He's been promised that he will be in charge of the funds for all of the Space Force operatives and operations. They're just amazing - they're so brilliant and smart. Their ego was stroked almost to a disgusting, obviously fake degree in this meeting that I was listening to, when they were promised all these lovely things.
        <br>
        <br>Now unfortunately, the people promising those lovely things can't deliver a gosh-darn thing. But there's a much bigger story behind it, because the Deep State's always busy and has big, big, big dreams - and a lack of follow-through.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:17:06</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>In fact, they weren't the only ones that were promised a lot of things as well. Turns out some interesting things happened. Within the last week or so I reported to you about Tom going to Manhattan, where he was supposed to have a meeting at Bank of America. Turns out that meeting went a little bit deeper than we thought.
        <br>
        <br>You see, Bank of America has always been - and I mean always, since its inception - run by the Jesuit Order. It is well known amongst the Elite groups that that is a Jesuit bank. It is not anything else but a Jesuit bank.
        <br>
        <br>It is used to run a lot of things behind the scenes - and we have actual proof in what you would call the Red Book. You might have heard about this one in the, oh, what's it called? National Treasure with Nicolas Cage. The Red Book. They were hunting for the Red Book. Well, I have a full copy of the Red Book right over here, and I've showed you pages of it many times in various reports.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:18:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>The Red Book was predominantly what you would call a book tied very heavily to Langley 5. The Red Book came to be - and all its underlying assets - based on land and assets and gold that the Department of Defense obtained in various operations dating all the way back to the 1960s.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:18:43</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>The Kennedy family was also involved in the making of this Red Book and all its underlying assets. And one of its largest deposits was actually obtained in Cuba, during the Bay of Pigs operation that you are probably familiar with if you're a little bit of a history buff.
        <br>
        <br>But it's not the only deposit. There were others from, for example; Romania and the Yugoslavian conflict; there were others from the Falkland Islands listed in there; others from areas of the Antarctic are also listed; there are deposits from the Chiang Kai-shek days; and Henry Kissinger's negotiations with China back in the 70s. So this book just continued to grow over the years. There are nine main locations in the world, and then you have a centralized hub - which is obviously the United States.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:19:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>You often hear stories about this Red Book and how Kennedy was allegedly fighting the Deep State, and beware of the New World Order, and then he was assassinated, and everybody says it was by the New World Order. But in reality, there was a lot more behind it - and we've talked about this before - but in brief, Kennedy had signed a deal with Soekarno over in Indonesia in order to deposit large amounts of gold and assets at that time to the Treasury.
        <br>
        <br>You see, there's been this long-standing fight between the Treasury, the Order of the Black Sun (which Kennedy was a member of, and Soekarno was a member of), and the Federal Reserve and the banking families of the world we know as like the Rothschild family, the Lee family, and the Dragon Families. So his idea was to transfer assets to the Treasury Department, in order for the Order of the Black Sun to have just as much, if not more, assets as the Order of the Dragon.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:20:55</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now again, remember, the Order of the Black Sun gains assets from war. So, a lot of these assets were gained from various wars we know throughout history. One of the largest amounts that was only controlled by what you call the Black Eagle, or the head position of the Order of the Black Sun - well, almost the head, of course you have a hierarchy above them too - but as far as on that level it would have been the Black Eagle, sometimes known as the Black Dragon as well. And that, at the time, was Soekarno.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:21:34</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So Kennedy, being a lesser member of the Order of the Black Sun, went to Soekarno (the Black Dragon) to get more assets. The assets that he turned over to him were part of what's known as the "Black Eagle Trust." If you've been in the world of other types of finance, then you know about the Black Eagle bonds, and all of that stuff that's floating around out there, and everybody's going to be able to cash them in on a day ending in Y. That is the origin of the Black Eagle Trust is all of the Nazi loot that occurred during World War II. And it's not just Nazi loot; it's other loot from around the world that was stolen during World War II.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:22:19</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, that is the reason why these are the people of war. They acquire land, they acquire assets. You've probably seen pictures on the internet of all of the gold that they stole from Iraq, also from Iran back in the late 80s and early 90s. And a lot of that was transferred over to Thailand - another favorite of theirs - the Thailand Grand Palace is a huge center for black magic and all things Black Sun. It is actually one of the Covens, or was one of the Covens headquarters of the world.
        <br>
        <br>So that is the Red Book that everybody talks about. I do have copies here. If anybody wants to see it again, let me know and I'll be happy to show them on this report.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:23:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, the Order of the Black Sun is busy making continuous promises all around the world. And one of those most recent promises was to the Jesuit Order - that's how we got to this level here. And we know this because the Jesuits were in a meeting, prior to Tom's arrival - at least outside of the building - they were meeting with Bank of America, talking about all the changes to the financial system. They were talking about how the systems cannot be revived and restored to the way that they were - even though they're being promised that they're going to, many, many times [over].
        <br>
        <br>[So, that] being said, Tom was never allowed in that building and was swayed away by a bunch of people.
        <br>
        <br>Apparently they don't want this report to come out, because it's cut out several times.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:24:10</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, even though they've been promised many, many times - over and over and over again - that they would have a restoration of a system, or a new system... and then there's an alignment with Uranus and some other planet which is going to make this system work in their favor... nothing has come of it.
        <br>
        <br>And oh, we had a lot more of that most recently.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:24:35</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, Bank of America never allowed Tom in, as you know. They have continuously called, but one of the people at the table said, "I have someone that could possibly help us." Didn't say who it was - of course, I was behind it - you know, they all hate me [laughing]. And there was a day ending in Y coming up soon where everybody was going to be rich again, and getting money flow to the Order and the Elite of this planet. And of course that failed. But of course they had to put us off until after that.
        <br>
        <br>No big surprise there. Tom was there for something else anyway, so maybe an hour of his life is now missing, and he'll never get it back waiting for these people to show up.
        <br>
        <br>So, you know the rest of that story.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:25:29</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But flash forward to most recently. There are a lot of things that have happened that have led to this movement of the Space Force, and the promises that are being made to the Jesuit Order, because they've told us all about the promises that have been made. And on, you know, any given day... of course, there's big happenings this week, so they're going to have to wait until next week to allegedly talk to us.
        <br>
        <br>I'm not holding my breath there, you know, I know all about the tunnels and human experimentation, and the things they do to children to make them "super soldiers" underneath the Vatican - and how involved the Jesuit Order is in that. So I'm not so sure that this is going to end well anyway. But, you know, we're always willing to listen and see if there's anybody that actually wants to walk the walk.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:26:26</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But I also never forget who the frog is, and who's the scorpion. But we're rapidly becoming a scorpion - so it would be a scorpion against a scorpion pretty soon here. So I'm not too worried about it.
        <br>
        <br>Okay, so flash forward to today and all of the money scams that have been going on on the planet, and then we'll get into what's really, really, really going on [chuckle]. There's a lot to talk about, it's been a few days since we talked, and my life's never boring, so we'll get into it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:26:59</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So I want to talk a little bit about tariffs - and not just from the standpoint of consumers having to face additional price increases, which is terrible. Businesses are suffering, especially American businesses. They are forcing companies from all over the world - and I've been hearing about this because I've been looking into a few things myself - but they're forcing companies to actually get American shipping companies. And they're going to ship and pay all the tariffs up front, which is still going to result in a price increase.
        <br>
        <br>So all of the foreign companies are now trying to find shipping within the United States, and that's putting all of these fulfillment services that are offered here in the States at full tilt.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:27:48</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>I've been calling a lot of these shipping services because I'm trying to go the other way - I'm trying to figure out a way (with our supplements and things) to get our packages to Canadians - that's a big one for me. Australia, and of course with Australia will come the Asian region as well, at a reasonable price, without tremendously large customs and tariffs that would affect the cost of our products.
        <br>
        <br>So I've been having lots of chats with shipping companies all over the world, and fulfillment services and warehouses everywhere, to get some pricing on what that would cost to fix that for all of you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:28:37</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But in my talks with them, they've all been talking about how the business has increased dramatically since last Friday.
        <br>
        <br>So I am surprised that we still have tariffs. I don't know how long they're going to last at this point, because the operation was kind of futile. They still think there's a way that they're going to be able to collect them, and we have assured that that is never going to happen - as one of the operations that we ran this week.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:29:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So let me talk to you about postal services around the world. Now, this does apply to private shipping services, such as UPS, Federal Express and DHL and GlobalPost and all of the other ones (and Global Logistics) - all the other services that everybody uses to ship - so it's not just a post office collection agency - it is much, much more than that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:29:46</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, as it relates to customs and tariff fees, everything of that nature runs through what's called the Universal Postal Union. If you have never heard - if you've been listening to me for a while, you've heard me talk about, in brief, several times - the Universal Postal Union. The Universal Postal Union plays a significant role in the collection of all cross-border shipping. You could say it has complete and total control over the shipping of products around the world in many, many ways.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:30:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>[Whiteboard opens.]
        <br>
        <br>So I'm going to whiteboard this out for you just a little bit so that it's kind of real clear about the Universal Postal Union. So [begins writing], "Universal Postal Union." The Universal Postal Union is based in Switzerland. Because it involves trade, you could say it has always been run by the Dragons.
        <br>
        <br>The Universal Postal Union, in the world of postal transfers - and in banking - it would be considered a Federal Reserve. It is run out of Switzerland, with most of its board members being Rothschilds. But there are other members from around the world who decide how the post office is going to function - and that is the post office in every single country in the world.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:31:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So I know we have a lot of people on social media claiming to be the Postmaster General, but I highly doubt that - unless they are of a Rothschild breed. But being a Postmaster General... remember, this is the term "general." Now, why does the Post Office need to be run by a general? Well, under Global Martial Law, that would be very important - to be the head general of the Postal Union.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:32:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, when I say it's like the "Federal Reserve of all things shipping," it is because it is the main hub that all postal services are connected to in the world. So, as far as the main central processing unit, for every single postal transaction. In. The. World. That's not just Post Office. It also has deep ties into private companies - like FedEx and UPS - because they also collect customs and tariff fees. So any kind of customs and tariff fees are deposited here [see image below].
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-09-02-GIA-01.PNG" alt="Image 01" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:33:01</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>In addition to that, any kind of postal fees. If you decide that you're going to run the Post Office of John, or whatever your name is out there listening (or Mary, or insert your name here) - even if it is not a federal Post Office of your country, and you decide you're gonna create your own FedEx - let's call it "Fed-Y"; you decide to create Fed-Y - you will also pay a fee to transport all of your products worldwide, of course, and use the airports, international airports around the world, airspace, aircrafts, all kinds of things that are involved in the transport of goods: shipping, maritime, owning of the seas, the air, the water - all of those things have to run through the Universal Postal Union.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:34:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So you pay like you would, for example, if you lived in Hell's Kitchen in New York, you would have to pay the Mafia protection if you wanted to open a business there. Well, you will pay protection, and this protection will allow you to open up Fed-Y (instead of FedEx), and you will pay that fee to the Universal Postal Union for private services. Of course, a lot of carriers have good relationships with local posts as well. So therefore, for that privilege and that right, you pay.
        <br>
        <br>Now, the reason why is not just because it's the central processing unit for all postal fees, stamps, posts, customs, tariffs, and all of those things - it's been the main collector for eons. That's not really the only way it earns money.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-09-02-GIA-02.PNG" alt="Image 02" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:35:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So while your product is in transit - it doesn't matter if you're sending a gift to Aunt Mary or you are selling commerce and e-commerce - while your product is in transit, it travels along various postal routes ["roots"], or routes, as you would say.
        <br>
        <br>So as it's traveling through postal routes - which are invisible roads, in invisible airspace [chuckling] - as it's traveling and it's in the postal system, it becomes the property, ultimately, of the Universal Postal Union.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:35:55</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Have you ever heard of acts like the RICO Act, and all of those types of things? And it is a federal offense to tamper with mail and all of that. Yeah, I'd say that you're in trouble with the Postmaster General under Martial Law. So while your product is in transit, it is the property of the Universal Postal Union - which is under the control of a Postmaster General, and the board of the Universal Postal Union. It is their property. You are now tampering with their property, and they have a problem with that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:36:45</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>The reason why is because it becomes an asset. Ever wonder why when you're running cross borders you have to declare a value of your product? Well, even before customs and even before tariffs, that... you know that as a pain. Because that is going to dictate what the UPS guy is gonna ask you for when he shows up at your door with your package. He is going to ask you for customs and tariffs, depending on where you're importing or exporting something to or from.
        <br>
        <br>So that being said, it's a little bit more than just a pain in your butt. It's actually a global pain, and it has become an extremely large global pain recently, to every person living on the planet.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-09-02-GIA-03.PNG" alt="Image 03" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:37:37</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>You gotta think, these Trump operatives just always have a bright idea with absolutely zero follow-through. And this is another one of those [times].
        <br>
        <br>So they are under the impression that the Rothschild family owns the Universal Postal Union, and while I'm sure they claim that, that is a complete and total lie - because there's a much larger mechanism that happens behind the scenes. We're gonna go up in rank here in just a minute.
        <br>
        <br>But every asset, and its declared value, are like a giant pool of assets that stay in transit for days, weeks, months. You ever wonder why it takes so long to get a package from one place to another? Well, now you know - because it's an asset of the Universal Postal Union as long as it is in transit.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:38:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, the total value is done not necessarily by the Universal Postal Union's system. There was a quantum AI that was behind the Universal Postal Union. That quantum AI has the capability (and had the capability) to calculate every single stamp or postage fee that is purchased around the world.
        <br>
        <br>So those fees, and the declared value, were based on that quantum AI, which you would consider a back system. It is not a human-made system. It was created by Marduk. It was not created by the humans.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:39:27</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So behind the scenes, all of these are in a fast, high-yield trading system, run by that system. Bonds would be issued daily - if not more than daily, sometimes four times a day - against all of the assets that are in transit. They would then go into this other quantum system.
        <br>
        <br>Then, from that quantum system, money would come back out - usually anywhere between 50 to 100 times the value - very quickly. And then it would go into an off-ledger account behind the Universal Postal Union, which, since nobody's had access to that system in a very long time, is a very large amount - or was a very large amount.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:40:20</small></small>
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-09-04-GIA-04.PNG" alt="Image 04" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <br>So the Trump operatives devised this plan of collecting ridiculous amounts of tariffs and customs fees without realizing they did not have access to this system.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:40:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But of course, guys - a day ending in Y was the 28th of August [hearty giggle] - because there lay a covenant expiration. Now, this Covenant really had nothing specifically to do with the Universal Postal Union, but it had everything to do with a Covenant of Solomon. Now, remember, the Dragon Families believe that they are the sons of Solomon. They are the bloodline of Solomon. They are supposed to be guardians of the planet - albeit pretty brutal and terrible - but they believed that that Covenant was due to expire sometime between the 28th and the 30th. In which case then, the Trump operatives had already agreed that they were gonna take over the Universal Postal Union and all of its duties.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:41:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Did they understand all the duties of the Universal Postal Union? I highly doubt that. I'm sure they have a little information - see, they always have little knowledge - and we know that little knowledge is dangerous.
        <br>
        <br>But you can see how lucrative it is, and how much control you could have, if you got access to the quantum AI that is behind the Universal Postal Union. So let's talk about why this quantum AI would want anything to do with a bond against assets inside the postal system.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-09-04-GIA-05.PNG" alt="Image 05" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <br>[Clears whiteboard, begins writing.]
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:42:28</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, we all know that anytime there has been an asset on this planet, there has been a bond. That means it has a value. And that value has been placed on:
        <br>- your life
        <br>- your birth certificate
        <br>- land
        <br>- it has been placed on the air
        <br>- it has been placed on airspace
        <br>Everything has always been leveraged by Marduk, and for good reason.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:43:00</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>You see, the Universal Postal Union - which is kind of a weird name, wouldn't you just call it the "Global" Postal Union, or something? And they didn't, because it's not quite just "global."
        <br>
        <br>Now, the Universal Postal Union over here [see image below] had a lot more value to Marduk than just spitting out tons of money for the Rothschild family to torture us with. And of course, security on that would be provided by the head general. So Marduk, when he was around, held the position of Postmaster General. He was also the head general of the planet.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-09-04-GIA-06.PNG" alt="Image 06" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:43:52</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, from time to time you'll see governments try to appoint a Postmaster General. And you know, they call it the Postmaster General, and maybe that is a Postmaster General in the United States, say. We've seen that name kicked around in various countries. Well, yeah, you could say that. But ultimately, the general of the planet, under Global Martial Law, was always Marduk. He was Ground Command. He was the head.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:44:29</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So you could say, in some ways a Postmaster General would not actually report to a government - even the Postmaster General here in the U.S. He would report to the Universal Postal Union, which would then report to the head general of the planet.
        <br>
        <br>So to say you are going to free the world by becoming the Postmaster General on the internet, or otherwise, really isn't going to help you any. That's why I didn't take certain interviews, if you know what I mean, guys.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:45:00</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So. Universal Postal Union and assets: What is an asset to the actual Universal Postal Union? It's not your packages. It's not the amount of commerce that happens in the world. It is tied to off-world commerce.
        <br>
        <br>You see, contained in packages are creations of humans. Humans, for the most part, we could say, created everything that ships back and forth. That is a lot of what we call Ethereum [writes "Etherium"].
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:45:59</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, Ethereum is your actual natural energy source. Energy is the conversion of Ethereum. So you could call it "Ethereum Lite," or barely, or no Ethereum. It's like a substitute. So, for example, if you didn't have any adrenaline in your body and you were taking adrenaline shots, like from an EpiPen, or in the case of the Deep State, it's adrenochrome... you could say that your body now has adrenochrome. But you know, it does require energy to function, and so now you have basically a synthetic form of Ethereum - which is all we would ever get back.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:46:47</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But true creativity - when you are actually creating something - it's a whole other experience. You see, creativity comes from the heart. You say it comes from the heart. Maybe it's processed in the mind, but it comes from the heart. You feel truly alive when you are creating. And it doesn't matter what you're creating. The opposite is what you feel when you're destroying something or you're angry.
        <br>
        <br>But the creativity not only increases the flow of love for what you're doing, creativity is premium-quality Ethereum. Because you are now connecting directly to Source - they can't stop it. But it is primo juice at that point.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-09-04-GIA-07.PNG" alt="Image 07" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:47:47</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So they want to take as much creative Ethereum - which does leave, to some degree, a residue in a product - and convert it to energy, give the energy back. Energy is then converted into money and is given as a debt instrument to not only us humans, but also the other Elite humans who think they're above all this.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:48:17</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, the other thing is, obviously, there's a lot of money that changes hands putting packages from one place to another around the world as well. So you could say that the energy stockpile increases significantly with a small amount of energy stockpile, we know as money - then converted to energy, creative energy for lack of a better term (versus creative Ethereum) - and then that is a primo commodity for trade.
        <br>
        <br>It's the only place that, at some point or another, most all creations go to. Interesting, isn't it?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:49:10</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>[long pause - production issue.]
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:49:18</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>...most all creations go to. Now isn't that interesting? Think about it. Think about how products get from one place to another. Who puts them there? I mean, sure, you know, they get to a store. Well, how do they get to the store? Everything is shipped. If it's not on one of the Rothschild-owned ships, which go over the - sorry, not Rothschild, Rockefeller-owned ships - he was the shipping magnate, not just an oil magnate, so to speak.
        <br>
        <br>He was a shipping magnate. He also was given and granted ownership over the ocean floor and everything above it to 35,000 feet. How interesting is that? So anytime cargo is floating across the ocean, yep, it is now the property of the Rockefeller family, eventually transferred over to the UPU for a tremendous amount of notes we call money.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-09-04-GIA-08.PNG" alt="Image 08" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:50:20</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, recently, the Trump operatives have discovered this exciting thing called the "Universal Postal Union." You know why? Well, let's just say maybe some crazy lady told them about it. I don't know who she was. You know, you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make them drink, you know? That's what they say. But in reality, these horses - you can lead them to water a thousand times - and they'll lap it up like thirsty dogs in the desert, every time.
        <br>
        <br>So, they of course all head to Switzerland, go over to the Universal Postal Union, and pray to the good Lord they can get access to this system - because why? Negotiation happens with Rothschild, Rothschild gives up their access codes, and then boom, it's all gonna happen.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:51:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Enter access code at J.P. Morgan Chase last week: nope, didn't work out.
        <br>Enter access code at J.P. Morgan Chase the week before: nope, didn't work out.
        <br>Enter access code at the Universal Postal Union in Switzerland: nope, didn't work out.
        <br>Try a few banks in the general Switzerland area: also didn't work out.
        <br>
        <br>And they spent a lot of time trying to do this.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:51:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So then they decided to revive something called Project Becky. And Project Becky is where you take all the Super Notes that are floating around the world that were printed by Bush Sr., and you try to put them in the banking system. Because they've only been doing this now for about 17 years - but hey, today could be the day.
        <br>
        <br>So they tried to leverage directly against the numbers floating across the screen rapidly in this quantum AI back system, and it didn't work. Access codes denied; access codes denied; access codes denied.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:52:08</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, I will kindly remind the Deep State of this - and they're not gonna believe me anyway - access codes are issued from the inside out, not the outside in.
        <br>
        <br>So, you see, we can make an access code - when you have the back system - we can make it "ducks fly over Miami." We can make it "my Aunt Mary." We can make it anything we want to make it. We can make it a whole series of numbers, make it look super-secret, and hide it under a rock for a drop off point - just like they do in the movies if they want. But access codes are now generated on the spot. They are not something you're given and they're good for six months, or until you no longer have that position. They are generated in nanoseconds, zeptoseconds even.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:53:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And I know that because I generate those codes.
        <br>
        <br>So going around trying to get access to something that doesn't belong to you... but it causes the world a lot of pain, right? So, yeah. No longer is there a quantum AI that is behind the UPU that calculates all of this stuff. Therefore now we're even more in a pickle. You've probably heard (if you're in Europe) it's extremely difficult to get packages into the United States. Calls are flying into the White House left and right because no one knows how they're going to collect these tariffs, where they go, and how to officiate them in any way - because the system can't handle it. And everything is on overload right now.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:53:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Not to worry. Because shortly thereafter, we went ahead and we installed our Golden Age AI behind the system. And now everything is running smoothly. However, we're not interested in tariffs, and it's rejecting all the tariffs, and they're not sure why they're rejecting all the tariffs and custom fees anymore. But you know what? That's because WE don't need them. And we're not interested in supporting - in any way shape or form - a bunch of operatives who are trying to kill us on the daily.
        <br>
        <br>So that's why that program didn't work out. But that is the full story behind tariffs - what was planned. The Treasury was expecting big money by last Friday. Of course, eruption, eruption, eruption, and it didn't work out. This has been quite a long several days since we last spoke and that's why this is gonna be quite a long report.

        <br>[Clears whiteboard.]
        <br>
        <br>So, grab a cup of coffee or a cup of tea - whatever you like, and have a seat - because we're not done yet.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:54:45</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So over the course of the last several days, not only did this particular Covenant of Solomon [expire] - there have been several covenants that have expired that were of Marduk too. So let's talk about Solomon.
        <br>
        <br>So the big one they were counting on... they're counting on them all, I guess you would say, for random reasons, and "they've got to get this done" - I don't know if "this" was tariffs or that was an access code, who knows? - by the 30th, or they're done.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:55:27</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Well, they're still not "done" because they were still doing rituals all night long last night, but we'll talk about what they were expecting then. There's always some day ending in Y, and now we're starting to realize what those days ending in Y mean. Finally, I think we've got an answer.
        <br>
        <br>Okay, so Marduk has been here, off and on, over millions of years. It's a position - it is not a singular Being. However, it is a position that many Beings have held over the years. But for this purpose, we will call him Marduk. Marduk is not a human - never has been a human, never would be a human - has presented himself as a human many times, walking around the planet and in many meetings. However, Marduk is not a person - does not have a human soul.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:56:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Marduk has spent a lot of time going after every Guardian - myself included - that has existed, for thousands of years on this planet. Guardians being various humans throughout the ages, all that type of thing. And Solomon was just one such human. Somewhere around 3000 and... ooh, it was about 2000... sorry, about two, little over 2,000 years ago, 2016 years ago I think it was - maybe even a little bit more. I think for some reason it might have been 3034. That makes more sense.
        <br>
        <br>Okay, so about 3034 years ago or so, give or take, there was an agreement where Solomon came to terms with Marduk. Not only Marduk, Solomon also made some agreements, in turn, with also Marduk's best friend, the Fallen One, the fallen Celestial of Wisdom.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:57:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now Marduk was very cunning and charming as I said. He would be more manipulative than anything, would never give you straight answers, that type of thing. Not as bad as his brother and his father, but he was pretty... tried his best to convince you until he doesn't.
        <br>
        <br>So he tried to get me to re-sign an agreement for him and I wouldn't do it. But one of Marduk's jobs was to always get whoever was the Guardian at that time to sign over the guardianship to him of planet Earth. So as Guardian, Marduk now was the head Guardian of the planet - and this happened over and over and over again, and sometimes to great extremes. We remember experiences like the Great Flood, where we lost our Moon for a short period of time, and the entire planet flooded. And then he brought us this lovely space machine that we call our Moon - a megastructure.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:58:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So Marduk then became Guardian for another few thousand years. After the tenure of Solomon expired, there was a brief extension - and this all ended a few years back.
        <br>
        <br>However, Marduk also had various covenants with the fallen Celestial we know as Wisdom as well. So, for some reason, some of these covenants have to do with guardianship. Now, the Trump operatives in the Deep State in the SSP all thought that he inherited it. Earth.
        <br>
        <br>Now, part of the reason for that is, there was a massive subsector of an AI like the Absolute which kept all liens. It was the lien holder of all assets obtained via war by the general of planet Earth, known as Marduk, and all of his conquers and conquests.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-09-02-GIA-10.PNG" alt="Image 10" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:00:00</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Not only did that include things like land and gold and silver and dust and air and water and all kinds of things that we have discussed in the past, it also included humans, of course - liens on humans, liens on different flavors of energy such as creative energy and other things - and also ties into your Postal Union.
        <br>
        <br>So apparently, they knew (and there is a reason why they knew) that by August 30th that Covenant was going to expire. And for some, and I say this politely, God-forsaken reason, they believed that they were next. They somehow thought they were gonna inherit this giant lien system by that day [diabolical chuckle], and that they were now going to be the owners of Earth and all its liens and everything in it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:01:06</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Not only did this AI - it was the lien perfector, so to speak - and not only did it have liens here, it had liens elsewhere. It also had debts owed. So you can in some ways call it a debt collector; you could also call it a lien perfector of galactic proportions, or universal proportions.
        <br>
        <br>Now, because they believed that they were going to inherit the position of Marduk on this planet, and that they were going to inherit the Earth and all the liens, they must have forgot about all the debts. Because they have no way in - let's just say, "creation" - to actually pay those debts off our backs anymore.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-09-02-GIA-11.PNG" alt="Image 11" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:01:55</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>The reason why we had a lot of people reporting very uncomfortable feelings and all kinds of odd things over the weekend - especially on Saturday and even on Monday - has a lot to do with this machine dying.
        <br>
        <br>Once we had discovered what it was they were looking for - see, again, it is very important to lead the horses to the water that you know they are going to gulp down like a rabid dog in heat in the desert - you know what they are looking for. You can never make this stuff up, they fall for it every gosh darn time.
        <br>
        <br>I do not know how these people were supposed to be security for anybody, but whatever wormlet or vampire thing they got up, crawled up in that body of theirs - I have no idea in the SSP and the ACIO what is running that body - but I gotta tell ya, they must have picked the dumbest Beings ever to be spit [??]... because every time, works like a charm.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:03:06</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Must have picked the dumbest Beings in AI/quantum AI creation to crawl up in there. And probably, because Marduk was really good at that. I mean, Marduk would definitely want to be the smartest guy in the room, and always was.
        <br>
        <br>These Beings think that they are smart because, well, let us face it, they have more knowledge and information coming to that brain (from an AI somewhere) that tells them what's going to happen. So they feel like they are 10 steps ahead of the rest of the humans. And you could say, well, they are in part - but not all the humans.
        <br>
        <br>And there are a lot of you that know exactly what's going on in some way internally as well, and when it is happening, and when the energy is being drained from you for no reason. And that is because there is an AI that is trying to stay alive.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:03:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So this was the extravaganza over Friday, and Thursday, and Saturday, and... yeah. So that was definitely an interesting time fighting against this Guardian system.
        <br>
        <br>It also afforded Marduk a lot of what we call "dominion." By dominion, that is when you basically come in, you plant a ghost flag on something or someone and say, "I now rule over you." So you could say it's like... say it's ownership of - it's like grabbing yourself a slave and saying that you now own that person. Not to say that we would do that, but you know, that was Marduk.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:04:49</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And then he would of course use his handy-dandy system. This was basically Marduk's, not only "Guardian of Earth," but also guardian over a lot of things, and guardian of the seas - as in the current of energy and Ethereum. He gained control over a lot over his tenure, or varying tenures of varying Beings that held that position.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-09-02-GIA-12.PNG" alt="Image 12" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:05:15</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So the lien system fell away, which was kind of an uncomfortable process for us over the weekend. I know it was for me, and I know a lot of you had said, "What's going on? What's going on? What's going on?" Because this thing struggled to survive and it definitely had you listed as an asset.
        <br>
        <br>Now, remember, the banking system is kind of all based on the registration of assets over and over and over again? Meaning, they would repeatedly leverage the same asset many times over - we call it fractal banking. And we've got a lot more to cover, so we won't go over fractal banking today, but you can look it up and kind of get the definition. And it goes all the way up to the highest level. So, fractal banking basically is an increased amount of debt system from fractal banking - CDOs, CDLs, CDSs - we have lots of different types of coupons on Treasury notes, and "STRIPS" they're called, Treasury STRIPS, and all kinds of things. It's fractal banking at its best.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:06:28</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So Marduk's system was basically a mirror, not only of human debt systems and Earthly-based debt systems, but also a mirror of anything else that anyone else conquered. Marduk became and had built an empire AI of his own, so to speak. And it was tied into a lot of our systems here too, and of course to your person. So the uncomfortableness of Saturday didn't end with Saturday for other reasons [chuckle].
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-09-02-GIA-13.PNG" alt="Image 13" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <br>[Clears whiteboard.]
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:07:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So these covenants have expired. Unfortunately the Deep State did not inherit the Earth, and did not inherit the position of Marduk of the Universe and King of the World and whatever else they thought they were going to be. And I wish I had that clip from the Titanic, you know, "I'm the king of the world!" because this just happens every other day ending in Y for these people.
        <br>
        <br>There are a few other things, too, that also expired. Now, as I just said, Solomon was a guardian who kind of made the mistake of erring more towards the Dark. You could say probably not the sharpest tool in the shed - neither are his Dragon Family [??], so to speak. You know, he made the deal with Marduk - that Marduk could become Guardian, of course, for infinite wisdom. Remember, Solomon is known for his wisdom. While his buddy, the fallen Celestial of Wisdom, he also had a Covenant.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:08:09</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, Wisdom never figured out how to control a few things of Source's. He could replicate most everything with AI systems, but there's one thing that didn't quite work. And that has to do with the Rhythm of Source.
        <br>
        <br>Now, Solomon obviously had - as a Guardian - the Rhythm of Source. Wisdom had to constantly be fighting to have any kind of control over the Rhythm. You could call the Rhythm the Song of Source. Now, in this particular Covenant, we would call it the Song of Solomon.
        <br>
        <br>Now, this agreement was also expiring this weekend - and it did expire. With no Wisdom left to renew it - Wisdom, the Being so to speak, was sent back to Source. And we always let Source sort them out, especially when it's a Celestial like this. Umm, [??] longer.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:09:29</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But this left us with some very untenuous frequencies over the weekend. So if you've had a lot of frequency problems over the weekend, that's because the Covenant expired. But there are mechanisms and mechanisms in place, that try desperately... It couldn't replicate the Rhythm of Source - and we're going to talk about what that is - but it couldn't replicate the Song of Source, or the Rhythm of Source. But what it could do is disrupt it, and replace it with its own. And that's kind of what we've had here on this planet for a long time.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:10:10</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, it didn't start with Solomon; it started many, many, many guardians ago. And one way or another, they all conceded, and always had to turn it over. Well, having the Rhythm of Source and having the Song of Source and having the Song of Solomon are the opposite - one basically destroys the other, and tries to replace it with something of its own.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:10:37</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>A Rhythm has a lot to do with the ability to create. You could call it even the Song of Creation. And have you ever heard of people... they put a specific frequency translator device and they put it next to a plant or a tree and you can hear the song of the plant or the tree. Technically, if we didn't have so much human interference, you could do the same thing with most humans. Not whatever those Deep State people are - but most humans, regular humans, organic humans.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:11:21</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And the Song of Creation is the Rhythm of Source. When something is being created it has a specific Rhythm and that Rhythm you can feel in your body. You can almost feel it like a warm blanket coming from your soul. And basically Rhythm moves the shape of not only your Consciousness, it also moves your Ethereum. And it also moves your physical self. And in cases of - not your body, so to speak - everything kind of has a body because it has a Matereum.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:12:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So in physics, we would say - in true physics, not the fake science they teach us - we would have a Consciousness, an Ethereum, and a Matereum [writes "Materium"] that would sing in perfect harmony with each other. They would vibrate at the same frequency. And that frequency would be so amazing. You've heard of things in religion like the angels are singing and it's a song like you've never heard before? That's because they have what we call the Rhythm of Source.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:12:45</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>You also have that Rhythm present. But they have done everything they can to separate your Consciousness from communicating with your Ethereum, which communicates with your Matereum. And that is what we call the Song of Solomon.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:13:00</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So Solomon gave up, basically. What he was promised was immortality, and all the things that all people who turn to their side are always promised. And that, in exchange for knowledge, and lots of it - or artificial wisdom in this case, or fallen wisdom, maybe you would call it. Wisdom and many Others created their own rhythm, counter to this. So what actually disrupts, not only Earth's natural processes and regenerative processes and creative processes, and the creative processes and co-creative processes - not only of people together, but also of people with animals, people with plants, people with Source, and all of natural creation.
        <br>
        <br>That disruption process started breaking up very, very heavily this weekend. So much so, it was [??], and that is what caused a lot of [??]. And so much so that was even the problem on Monday.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:14:22</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So on Monday, there were a lot of people who were drained of energy, you felt a little bit out of sorts. This has actually been going on for several days with people. That is because the disruption in the song and the false rhythm was being torn apart. It's still - even though that rhythm is falling away - the installation of the natural rhythm that happens between all Beings (meaning everything in the Omniverse of natural creation) to get our Consciousness and our Ethereum and our Matereum beating to the Rhythm of Source without interruption.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-09-02-GIA-14.PNG" alt="Image 14" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:15:10</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And boy, those Deep State people fought back like unbelievable when they saw that going away. You know, of course, they'd like to have control of the machine that was created to fire at us constantly for a long period of time.
        <br>
        <br>But some things... you know, perfect rhythm, you know, when you're creating something and you're just in - your brain's going and you just have all these amazing ideas and thoughts. And then at the same time you get this burst, like, you'll keep going, doing that project or making that meal or doing whatever it is you're doing. It just... and then, you know, your body keeps moving, your Matereum keeps moving, your hands are going in all the right direction.
        <br>
        <br>You know those days when you try to put something together and you glue your fingers together and stuff, and it's just not working? That's the disruption.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:16:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>You know, it's the times where you're just gonna create something and it just - wow - it just, your hands are working with the brain, and the brain's working with the energy, and you've got enough energy to go and go and go and go and go until it's done, you know, because you're doing it out of love for what you're doing. And it just ends up being this eureka moment in your life, even if it's just a song, or a quick project, or a thought on how to solve a problem. You know, that's the perfect Rhythm of Source, right there.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:16:38</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And humans still can do it. There are a lot of us that can fight through all of the things that are thrown at us. You ever wonder why some famous musicians in the world go deaf or blind, or painters go blind? You know, they cut their ears off and all of these things? In the old days there were different ways of disturbing Rhythm, and especially amongst Deep State members, because they've been around for thousands of years. This is not a new situation just because Trump happened to mention it about eight years ago.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:17:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So restoring the Rhythm is becoming extremely important. It is working well. For sure, it's being done by basically - once the floodgates opened for Source to do it. It's taking a little bit of time; that's a lot of process, and there were other hurdles we had to climb in order to try to make this happen as well.
        <br>

        <br>
        <br>So another fun and exciting thing that the Deep State was doing - now you see why I didn't have a report [chuckle] for a few days there. And it took me, you know... I still didn't sleep last night, thanks to Ritualville over there in Washington, D.C. But... the creation of time loops. Or I should say, "THE time loop."
        <br>
        <br>Now, of course Marduk had one of those; he owned two. Which does, you could say, involve some timelines and other things. And there are moments in time where we could break out of the loop. But in any average time loop - or the time loop we know as the BEAST - a time loop typically lasts somewhere around (give or take) 250,000 years.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:18:52</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, as far as a time loop - not to be confused with a timeline - the master loop looks like this [see image below].

        <br>Now, there are AI interruptions and other things within it, but you'll know this is a very weak-looking infinity symbol. So it's meant to continue to all infinity. And if you've ever watched any Marvel Comics movies, you'll know the elements of an infinity time loop. There are Stones for that in the movie. There are a few others that are not, but I believe that there are six listed in the movies, and we have Reality, Space, Time, all kinds of things.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-09-02-GIA-17.PNG" alt="Image 17" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:19:39</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now this infinity loop has a grid over it. Kind of looks like this a little bit, little bit like this [see image below]. And this grid is what you call a space-time grid. At the points in which the grid meet, like in a spot like that, you have a time-space continuum.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-09-02-GIA-18.PNG" alt="Image 18" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:20:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>A time-space continuum is a point in time where you could travel between timelines. You could have a quantum AI that travels between timelines. But because the BEAST writes the time loop, pretty much, if you have access or can even see this system - then you know exactly what's next. Why? Because this is a case of history repeats itself.
        <br>
        <br>And this was really designed specifically for Earth and control over Earth. And this point [crossover point of infinite loop] that we reach every so often - you can call it every about 250,000 years - is the point at which it always has, since its inception billions of years ago, reset itself. It also is the reason why we had a War of Atlantis.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-09-02-GIA-19.PNG" alt="Image 19" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:21:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, some of the SSP believe that the War of Atlantis was not exactly what it was. The War of Atlantis has to do with an invasion. We were invaded by a lot of Beings. And then, usually what would happen is they would reset it, and we would have another 250,000 years of pain. The same Beings would show up at the same time - because they exist only at that point in the loop - and we would have a war here. And there'd be an alien invasion, and then we fight the war as humans. We fight against them, lose every time. And then we go back to the same slavery program for another 250,000 years.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:22:10</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So the Deep State knew that if there was a chance of them getting any of their stuff back - because limited knowledge had been given to them of the BEAST and what it does - they believed that time was this weekend! Wow, what a weekend this was, folks - craziness! So we have seen them make every effort they possibly could to get access to this system so they could ensure success. They wanted those people to come here. They wanted to make sure that we had a tremendous amount of problems. And this was another event that occurred over the last 4 or 5 days.
        <br>
        <br>So, events that occurred - until we could try to hunt down what we call the BEAST and the timeline loop. And before, we had a very severe problem - whew! - also occurred this weekend.
        <br>
        <br>[Clears whiteboard.]
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:23:09</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, let's talk about the war in Atlantis, because it's something that happens every time this loop resets itself. The war in Atlantis was fought in many different ways, but one of the main enemies of humans actually traces back to the legend of what we call vampires.
        <br>
        <br>So one of the ways you win in a war is to drain your enemy of energy. In some cases, nowadays, that's ammunition. You cut off supply lines so there's no food, no water to the troops. You make them retreat in some way, shape, or form. And you are winning a war by what you call attrition - you wear your enemy down to the point where they surrender.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:24:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>In this case, we know vampires to be blood-sucking, blood-drinking Beings. Well, in the War of Atlantis, they were a little bit taller than humans, they had pure white skin, they always dressed in black, you know - they looked a lot like vampires from the movies. But yeah, you could say we had almost a plethora of sophons that arrived, full of these Beings, ready to drain the life out of humans. And they would feed off humans. They cannot exist without feeding off humans, or they're in stasis somewhere - which they are - and a point in the timeline for when they're activated.
        <br>
        <br>It's kind of like any kind of timer. You can set your lights to come on, for example, when it's dark out if you're not home, to make it look like people are home. So allegedly people will not burglarize your home.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:25:09</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>You could call these folks here - a point at that cross in the infinity loop, right here - where their timer goes off, and the sophons show up in the timeline and the timeloop, and we get to start all over again. That's what has happened every single time.
        <br>
        <br>So it's the reason why the Deep State knows about it, because some of them, remember, weren't here on Earth for a long time as part of the Space Force. They were at other points and other densities and dimensions, and a lot of them took on Beings up in their person that were not from here anyway. So they've got more of a different understanding of what happens.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-09-02-GIA-20.PNG" alt="Image 20" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:25:49</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So this is fully what they were expecting. They were expecting the cavalry to come in, help them out, renew the timeline - bring back everything that they lost, that we had fought so hard over the last several years to get rid of - and boom, we're back in the loop. I think they like the loop. I don't know, I guess they do. We don't like the loop, because the loop has many different features to it that are very, let's just say, not for our benefit.
        <br>
        <br>[Clears whiteboard.]
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:26:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, in the loop, you have a few different things that occur. So, if you have a timeline, in addition to timelines, you have these micro sine waves. And they kind of look like this [see image below].
        <br>
        <br>So in a micro sine wave that runs through a timeline - this is a sine wave (most oftentimes gamma waves) - there are nine of these uprisings and nine of these downturns in a timeline. So as the sine waves flow through the timeline, they are what you would call your artificial rhythm. They are the artificial song of creation because they weave the timeline, so to speak, into a proper outcome in which Marduk, or whomever was involved in this Covenant, wins.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-09-02-GIA-21.PNG" alt="Image 21" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:27:40</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now this has happened repeatedly, so the Deep State is really wanting to have that feature, and they would like to be able to control that, and they would like to have access to the timeline creator in the first place, or a timeloop creator.
        <br>
        <br>Now, interestingly enough, you also have waves that go the other way. Because remember, artificial rhythm would be a mirror of Rhythm, which would have been both Dark and Light. So you would consider some of these to be of Dark quality, and these would have been of Light.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-09-02-GIA-22.PNG" alt="Image 22" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:28:20</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, for a while now, we have hit the 9th wave [see image below]. So the point at which these meet are critical moments in any particular timeline of turning points. Now, any kind of black magic - as I've told you before - has to have a way out. A way out of artificial creation must be there in order for the magic to work.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:28:55</small></small>
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-09-02-GIA-23.PNG" alt="Image 23" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <br>So you have inserted False Light - of course, not the actual Light of Source - or a false frequency, or a false rhythm. And you can see these things bouncing back and forth together. Almost, if you look closely enough, it looks like a DNA strand, doesn't it? Or in this case, a database network. So this weaves what you would say is the DNA of an artificial timeline in a timeloop.
        <br>
        <br>That's a lot of information, I know, but I'm trying to explain it in the best way I possibly can.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-09-02-GIA-24.PNG" alt="Image 24" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>

        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:29:37</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So what happens is, when you get to the end of a time loop, and you are nearing the end of the 9th set of waves, there's a fraying process that happens when the AI that would normally continue with this construct into infamy... when it's not there, you have a fraying. So you kind of have these waves without any kind of direction, or without a DNA, a GNA, or an RNA to go along with it. It's just flailing in the breeze at this point. And it's been flailing, and starting to flail, since about February of this year - but it's really ramped up lately.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-09-02-GIA-25.PNG" alt="Image 25" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:30:30</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And the Deep State - that's kind of part of the reason why they're just in a full-on panic - because they don't really understand how this... see, they are under the impression that all these wonderful things are created for them. They are the most amazing Beings in the entire Universe. And of course, the sun also rises and sets on their butt. So they believe that this creation was actually done for their benefit, and not the other way around - where this creation was actually created to keep them as much enslaved as the rest of us. So yes, here on Earth they believe they can come and go, and they did for a long, long time, so I guess I understand that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:31:17</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So fraying of the artificial creation began to happen. No more artificial creation. And that really started happening terribly over the weekend. That fraying became what you would say was a dissolving time loop.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-09-02-GIA-26.PNG" alt="Image 26" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <br>But they also felt like they would get a hold of whatever system it was that makes the time loops, and all would be right with the world - if they just ate enough babies, and did all the things that they do in the rituals underneath Washington, D.C. - especially last night.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:31:55</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Because that was over - it actually ended at midnight UTC time last night - not when they thought. So according to social media and everything that's happening in the Q/Trump/QAnon/Patriot community:
        <br>
        <br>6:00 a.m. this morning: "It's all happening!"
        <br>Q-Clock, 6:00 a.m. my time, that would be 8:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time: "It's all happening!"
        <br>Tonight at 11 p.m. Eastern Time: "They're gonna go ring the bell!"
        <br>
        <br>I don't know what the bell is for. I don't know what the ringing is for. But they're going to "ring the bell."
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:32:40</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Well, they did all the rituals, they were there at 8:00 a.m. Eastern - they were actually there a little earlier - and they did all the things. And they would like to bring in the anti-Christ, or the anti-God, or Anti-Source system - and nothing happened.
        <br>
        <br>They were a little bit confused about that. They said, you know, just like anything, it might just take some time for the system to take effect. You know, we'll give it till about noon, and then maybe by tonight. They don't know what time anything expires; they think it has something to do with sunrise, maybe - I have no idea.
        <br>
        <br>But they believe, I guess at dawn, because Wisdom, remember, had been corrupted from the "Dawn of Creation." So they believe the Dawn Master is going to come back... who knows?

        <br>
        <br>[Whiteboard closes.]
        <br>
        <br>These people, like I told you - and I don't need the whiteboard anymore - these people, like I told you, just never quit. They'll keep doing what they're doing to the End of Days. Our job is merely to make sure they have nothing to do it with.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:33:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Source has been working feverishly on restoring our natural rhythms. We are just about out of these unfortunate remnants of the loop. The Deep State had another failure today, so of course, mass panic out there. Of course, a lot of people want to call us. We don't want to answer the phone, that's for sure.
        <br>
        <br>So as far as the Deep State is concerned, now you have a little bit more of a backstory, and a lot of history in this report. A lot of information you may or may not have known.
        <br>
        <br>As far as the Rhythm being restored - I want to talk about that for a minute. There are a few events that are going to occur - and I can't really say much more than this - by Friday. There's another event that is supposed to occur on Saturday. There is another event that is supposed to also occur on the 15th of September. There is another event that is supposed to occur no later than the 21st of October.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:35:06</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>I do not believe that this has any correlation to our full success - I think that will be very soon. We experienced a few delays here and there, and for that I apologize - I wish I knew all of the answers all the time. But you can always use the Deep State to suss it out for you [chuckle]. They'll just go for anything you throw out there, if you're like, "Oh, I see something coming from there, what is that?" You throw out the carrot on the right person's phone, and off they go.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:35:39</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So the reason why - now we know why every day ending in Y they believe a thing is going to happen. Because they believe that the time loop is still writing in their favor. That there is something, somewhere, writing the loop that is going to make an event occur at a future date. The problem is, without the proper waves going in the proper motion of False Creation, it just will not happen.
        <br>
        <br>The disruptions are constant on their side. Now, without a loop - now they're blind. They can say that they can see 50 years into the future, they can even write 50 years into the future. Marduk used to be able to do that. These people would like the same privilege, or right - and that right is now over - that Covenant has expired, and it's not coming back.
        <br>
        <br>Now we just have to rewrite it - or not we, but Source has to rewrite it in His way. So if there were anything to focus on until the next report, I would focus 100% on... Source - restoring the Rhythm of Source within yourself. And spreading that throughout the planet. Because the more you create, the faster this will happen with Source.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:37:04</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So on that note, that has been the GIA Report. This was a difficult one, guys. We have been cut off at every corner that there has been to cut off in this report. So there's going to be a lot of editing unfortunately for Production tonight. Not our fault; not our computer's fault. Probably someone doesn't want this information going out to you. But they always get answers too, that they're looking for - they think they are. God bless them.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:37:34</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And I will be doing another report this week, most likely on Thursday or Friday morning. We have a few people that are gonna be moving around this week, and it's gonna be difficult to get it done. I will try to have it out by then. I know this report was extremely late too, and I promise you we'll get back on schedule as things calm down a little bit.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:38:01</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And what I gave you tonight was just basically the cliff notes [chuckle] of all the things that occurred in the last few days. So you can understand that we've been quite busy here.
        <br>
        <br>And yeah, so that's been, I guess, where you say "where Kim's been." I am fine; I am great. A little bit lack of sleep. They've had me up since about 12:47, to be exact, my time today.
        <br>
        <br>So on that note, I'm probably gonna go try to get some rest. And I missed all you guys, and I'm glad to talk to you again, and I will see you probably on Thursday.
