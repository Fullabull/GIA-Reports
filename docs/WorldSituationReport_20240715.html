World Situation Report
<br>2024-JUL-15 News</h2>

<br>00:35:54

<!-- TEASER:-->

<h3>And now the World Situation Report with Kimberly Goguen from the Office of the Guardian. The real story behind the Trump alleged assassination attempt. The signs are everywhere. You just have to know where to look. More going on behind the scenes as the Deep State believe they could flip the fabric of reality with a little help from their friends.</h3>

<br>Sunny: And now here's Kimberly Goguen with the Office of the Guardian. Hi Kim, how are you?
<br>
<br>Kim: You know, I really don't know the answer to that question. I'll let you make that decision when we get to the end of the report.
<br>
<br>Sunny: A little sleep deprived, I hear.
<br>
<br>Kim: Yeah, you know what?  It's one of those things, be careful what you wish for. Not wish for, I should say, but you know, on Friday's report I had mentioned that we were going to be hunting down every last bit of consciousness we could find - and boy was that rabbit hole a little bit more than I bargained for.  So we'll get into that in a minute.
<br>
<br>But first we have to talk about the thing that everybody's talking about everywhere everybody, and so we're gonna just go through these some of these clips are just clips we found on the internet so it's nothing real prolific here, but when you put them all together in a sequence ... [broken transmission]... it kind of tells you a story.
<br>
<br>So we pulled a couple of these clips out for that specific reason, because I wanted to point out to people that things aren't often as they appear. Some of the things, before we get into the videos, some of the things that were pointed out to me is, there was a lot of backchatter about this attempted fake assassination for a while now.  We've been talking about it for months. So it's not a surprise.
<br>
<br>The only surprise is how it kind of turned out. And it seems like the operatives are definitely playing the martyr card here in every way, shape, or form. Also creating division between Americans, those that are for and those that are against. And there's a lot of programming, and a lot of social media programming that goes along with that.
<br>
<br>And you can't really stage an event like that, and have the information go out that quickly. And actually if you look at some of the news - some of the news, if you were watching things real time, actually beat out the actual event itself. (Oh, jeez!) I know. God bless them.  Well, you know, like you said, Sunny, I mean, you got those papers and you got to go report on it.
<br>
<br>So we did get word that there was going to be something. Now there are two things that have come up in backchatter. Number 1, allegedly someone from Russia called the Trump administration, or had lots of talks with the people, the operatives behind the Trump thing - whatever that is - and said that there was gonna be an assassination attempt. Now, the reason why is because at that point, they had not yet figured out who was going to be blamed.  And at the time, Russia was ripe for the picking, to be blamed for this assassination attempt.
<br>
<br>And that happened weeks ago. Now, several days ago, there was some kind of an intelligence briefing that went out to all of the presidential campaigns, saying that there's a lot of talk about an assassination attempt on a presidential candidate. Therefore, Robert Kennedy canceled a lot of his campaigning for a short period of time, during the duration they were expecting something to happen.  So did Jill Stein, and a few of the other candidates did as well. And whatever that is, walking around in the White House also canceled some of their things. That's not a surprise.
<br>
<br>00:40:27
<br>
<br>I mean it's hard to really kill a computer-generated image, but hey, you never know what can happen! You never know what's going to happen over there! So this, however, was not entirely unexpected, but it was concerning, when I actually heard that it was happening. It was concerning to me because you have a lot of people in this country that are true patriots, war veterans, people that carry guns, firearms, that really truly believe in this president.
<br>
<br>And, a matter of fact, I was on a phone call with a friend of mine whose husband is pretty much a normal kind of person.  And when he got word of it, we happened to be on a call, and it was disconcerting because this person also owns some guns and that kind of thing. And he said he's gonna go and shoot everybody's house that has a Biden thing in front of their front lawn. And he didn't end up doing anything. But it just goes to show you - this is kind of an older guy, it's not a younger guy by any means - but, what are people going to do? What is going to be the response?
<br>
<br>And of course, social media has been ablaze with those saying the Democrats are to blame. Now, the reason for concern here, for me, is because this mimics Ronald Reagan, 1981. This mimics JFK Jr.  And the beginnings of the Cold War, and those types of things. So there's a lot of - Vietnam shortly thereafter - because it usually goes in a sequence of events. There is also a lot of chatter about 9 countries, including the United States, being fully bankrupt. And I don't disagree with that fact. I know that there was a lot riding on today for those people, and we'll get into that in a little bit.
<br>
<br>And my concern was, what is next? I've heard about other political killings in the Middle East that were on the list of backchatter coming from Trump operatives, and a few other things that would have sparked World War III. The other thing that I heard about was that, initially in the news - in some news channels - they were reporting this was a Chinese national in the very beginning and then that quickly got wiped. And then there was also talk about being of Middle East origin, and that kind of thing, and then that got wiped out. And now he's just a regular guy from Pennsylvania, or is he?
<br>
<br>Sunny: Right. You're talking about the shooter, the alleged shooter?
<br>
<br>Kim: The alleged shooter, yes. So let's take a look at some things I'm sure you've seen over and over and over again, and maybe some of them you haven't seen.  But let's talk about the first bystander that started talking to every reporter that there is, coincidentally.
<br>
<br>00:44:00
<br>
<br>Reporter: ... tell us what you saw.
<br>
<br>Bystander: So we had a party here all day, you can see behind us the Brinkman's Farm and Greenhouse here, we had a party. And we all decided, hey, when we hear Trump up there, we're gonna walk up through the field, stand by the trees out there under the shade, and watch the rain, listen to the rally. We couldn't see him, but we could hear him. So we walked up, and probably 5 to 7 minutes of Trump speaking- I'm estimating here, I have no idea, you know - but we noticed a guy crawling, army, you know, bear crawling up the roof of the building beside us, 50 feet away from us. So we're standing there, you know, we're pointing, We're pointing at the guy crawling up the roof.
<br>
<br>Reporter: And he had a gun, right?
<br>
<br>Bystander: He had a rifle. We could clearly see him with a rifle. Absolutely. We're pointing at him.  The police are down there running around on the ground. We're like, hey man, there's a guy on the roof with a rifle! And the police are like, huh, what? You know, like, they didn't know what was going on. You know, we're like, hey, right here on the roof!  We can see him from right here. We see him. You know, he's crawling! And next thing you know, I'm like, I'm thinking to myself, I'm like, why is Trump still speaking? Why have they not pulled him off the stage?  I'm standing there pointing at him...
<br>
<br>Kim: Yeah. So, allegedly, this person just happened to be at the same location that happened to be beside a building where apparently a potential presidential candidate, or not a potential but a presidential candidate that he supports clearly he's got orange hair he's got the whole orange gig going on the hat the whole deal you know, gotta be on camera with all the garb, because everybody walks around like that all the time don't they? And they, and then you see this guy up there - I mean come on now. Wouldn't you have called 911? Wouldn't you have called like you're not just gonna yell hey, you know.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Well, and he's also making the police that he allegedly was trying to flag down, he's making them sound ridiculous. Which is part of the narrative that is out there right now, that it's not the Secret Service's fault - allegedly if this even went down - that it's not the Secret Service's fault, that they were blaming it on police. So this kind of goes along with that narrative of, well, at least, you know, even this man on the street said they saw this guy with a rifle and the police didn't do anything about it. Right?
<br>
<br>Kim: We should probably play that propaganda video at some point again. You know, glittering headlines, man on the street. I support so-and-so for president, and I knew Johnny since he was a little boy and the whole thing. And this is another case of man on the street, but we have another man on the street. So let's see what he had to say.
<br>
<br>Man on the Street: First thing before, I saw for three minutes, maybe four minutes, like you were talking about in that BBC interview. There was 20 Secret Service agents running around like chickens with their heads cut off in that field, and you're telling me snipers on the barn can't see this guy 100 yards? It doesn't add up to me.
<br>
<br>Reporter 2: Yeah, Timothy. Thank you for sharing your story.
<br>
<br>Reporter 3: Yes, your eyewitness account is important, and thank you for being here. I'm glad you're safe.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Kind of surprised they ran that, actually. (Laughing)
<br>
<br>Kim: Yeah exactly. But did they? Or, you know. (Yeah.) But I'm sure they expected it to be taken a different way. But you know when you're already starting to look at something skeptically - you know we look at this and we say, how did everybody else see it? But the people that were supposed to see it, didn't allegedly see it.
<br>
<br>00:48:01
<br>
<br>Sunny: Exactly.
<br>
<br>Kim: It could be because they looked at it and said, "Oh, that's one of our guys."  We'll get into that in a minute. I know. Yeah, no kidding, right? But I did want to make a note about the way Trump allegedly looks, a few minutes after being picked up.  Meaning they picked him up off the ground, he does the whole fist bump, does several photo ops, because everybody that gets shot in the head is not disoriented in any way, shape, or form.
<br>
<br>I mean, even a graze by the ear like that will knock your equilibrium off, you can't hear anything, you hear high-pitched tones. I mean, it literally wrecks you, number 1. Number 2, that's pretty much just cartilage and soft tissue. And from talking to some other people, as well as my own thoughts here too, is that if you have a soft tissue wound with a bullet - and ballistics will tell you - that it still would have hit - the top of his ear would have been flapping off.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Oh gosh.
<br>
<br>Kim: You know, it's just such soft tissue and it's cutting like a knife. I mean, it's coming from a long ways away, the velocity and speed of the bullet and that kind of thing. This is something that all snipers know. They know about velocity, wind, when the right time is to shoot, that kind of stuff. How long it takes to get there, all these are calculations that you learn if you've ever been in the military or anything like that.
<br>
<br>Now.  Next thing I want to point out here is the amount of blood. Sunny, have you ever like split your lip or had really bad chapped lips and you split your lip and I mean that sucker just bleeds like nobody's business. I mean you look like you have been in a massacre when any part of your face is cut - like severely cut, not just like I scratched myself with my nails or something. But your face has so much blood flowing to your head, your brain, your face, your neck, your jugular veins right there. But when you get a more severe injury, like myself, I have put my whole front teeth through my lip at one point in time and I have 10 stitches and I still have a scar there to prove it.
<br>
<br>But, I mean I had it all down my shirt, all over my - even just going from outside where the incident happened to a place where I could get a towel. A bathroom, a restroom, something, someplace where I could get a towel, I mean, I was covered. It just bleeds like crazy. And this was a number of years ago.  So you know, but I can tell you right now that the amount of blood that is shown there is not not a real situation.
<br>
<br>Because if anybody watching this has ever been in the military, anybody ever seen anybody get a bullet graze, allegedly, in the ear or face or any other part of your body, you'll know that especially on the head, if you've ever been into a fight, you ever fell down, ever went over the handlebars as a kid on your bike - you know what I'm telling you is true. It just looks like you are bleeding more than, you know, and then you kind of get down to the injury, and it's a small little quarter-inch cut. But you look like massive damage has been done.
<br>
<br>So I'm not buying it - not buying that in any way shape or form. I mean even a graze on the ear, you'd be disoriented, you'd be you'd be hearing tones. Oh and then you certainly, the first thing that you would be thinking, at that time, is where is my shoes?  And how in the hell did you lose your shoes in the first place? Because that also makes sense.
<br>
<br>00:51:53
<br>
<br>Sunny: Also the amount of opportunities for - like you could tell he'd been prepped before, about getting the good shots that the media can use afterward, right? Because if there are bullets flying at me and if I am grazed on my ear or whatever, the first thing I think of is getting out of a huddle with Secret Service and throwing my arm up in the air, you know, in some sort of movement, like we're gonna get them, let's rally the crowd! If this were real, he'd be getting out of there. And I don't know what the Secret Service were doing, why they stayed there so long with him. You usher them out, you get them out!
<br>
<br>Kim: Yeah. Well, not only that, he actually got down on the ground himself.  And then they huddled all in. I mean, it was seconds, but still... Totally the world's a stage, you know, I'm sure anybody in the military or anybody in the police force or retired police, whatever, watching this will say, oh my gosh, no! If you've ever been shot, even a graze, this is not how your body is going to react. This is not a thing. Especially for a man as old as he is, in your 70s.  Okay.
<br>
<br>Sunny: One thing, Kim, that I found interesting. So, you know, I'm staying with my family and they are Trump supporters, okay? So I kind of got a message on Telegram that some stuff was going down and I mentioned something to them and everyone rushed to the TV, right? To watch what was going on. What I found was interesting is that they're asking really good questions. They're actually saying, "That doesn't make sense. Like how did this happen? That's not making sense."  But the moment I say something about, maybe it really didn't happen, it's like, there's only... you know, the cognitive dissonance sets in. Right? Oh it can't be that!  It's like people are picking up on clues, but people are not adding two and two together. Which I find - I guess I'm not surprised by - but I'm frustrated by, because I'm like, gosh, you're on a roll. Keep going with that.  Keep asking questions about why this happened and why that didn't happen.  You know, like that kid, you know, I'm gonna call him the kid that little sound bite that we played from that guy is like, "Hey, I'm not buying it." I wish more people would put two and two together. It's a little frustrating.
<br>
<br>Kim: Well, it's kind of, you kind of get to this point where you are questioning - as an average everyday person now, people are seeing a lot more - but then there's this internal fight that you have. Because if this was faked, what kind of a man am I believing in that's going to save America? You know, it would be almost as bad at this point - and I'm sorry to say it, but it's kind of true - it would be almost as bad as playing footage from 2000 BC, and Jesus walking off the cross going, "All right, cut!"
<br>
<br>Sunny: Because they are treating him like a savior, whether they'll admit it or not. Someone has to save us from Biden. Trump's our guy.
<br>
<br>Kim: Yeah. Yeah. And of course, nobody looks at any other candidates from any other party, you know, so this is all you got.  It's actually a process that they teach you in sales school, called guided discovery.  If you are selling multiple, like, for example, I worked for a bank many, many years ago and I went to a two-week sales school, and the things you can say - of course, there's compliance, you have to, but they also give you some suggested techniques in order to upsell your customers so they have more bank products. Move your car loan over here from the other, we'll give you a better rate. This checking account, maybe an annuity, an IRA, that kind of thing. So they teach you to only present two options. Would you like option A, which is a full package of all our products we offer, we'll help you move them all over the whole thing. Or option B, which is just a couple of products less, maybe you don't want an IRA, maybe you don't want a car loan, then this is the one for you.
<br>
<br>00:56:09
<br>
<br>And very few people, surprisingly, will tell you no. And if they do, then you flip it over, and you give options C, D, and E. And that is what you're told to do, when you work for a bank and you're upselling products and stuff at the time. So it's the same thing with presidential candidates and everything else. You're taught - if you want fast food, you're only going to McDonald's or Burger King - which one would you like?  And the same thing with Republicans and Democrats. Well we've had many other parties out there, and we still do.  And there are candidates you've probably never even heard of, but no one bothers to look.
<br>
<br>So. Okay, next. Let's talk about the location of the purported shooter. Okay. And we've got a little bit of a map for that.
<br>
<br>Sunny: So Kim, explain this to us. What exactly are we looking at here?
<br>
<br>Kim: OK. All right. So what we're looking at is - the blue dot here is the Trump stage. That's where he's actually standing. So you would see him facing outward towards the longer part of this rectangle on this farm area. And the buildings would be behind him, is what you would see.  So he's facing out this way. So you can see that the shooter is off to allegedly his right-hand side. Okay, and it's not that far away. It's a clear line of sight.  For you to set up an AR-15 or other type of an assault rifle or something that's going to fire from that many yards away, you are definitely going to see that.  And we will show you a little bit more here in a minute, on the recoil that you would get from a gun like that.
<br>
<br>But you can see that it's a fairly clear line of sight. In a normal circumstance, most of the Secret Service would have been on those rooftops behind them. You would have had some over there off to the right, you know, you would have scouted out the entire area - for a president to travel anywhere, even a former president or a potential presidential candidate - they are there two weeks ahead of time. Always. And they don't leave.
<br>
<br>They send in what they call the scouts, and they stay there for two weeks ahead of time.  Planning and plotting and looking at all possible avenues.  That's their job, right? So for them not to see this as a potential issue is ridiculous. Both people that are "bystanders", say that they alerted - they saw the guy - everybody saw the guy. They said Secret Service was running around on the ground like crazy people, why didn't anybody else see the guy?  He was there for awhile, allegedly.
<br>
<br>Now, it's gonna get uglier here. Next clip.
<br>
<br>Video narrator: Let's start from the beginning. This is the Secret Service. There's another one here. This guy right now has his sniper rifle on the so-called shooter. All right. The problem I have with that is - if he sees the shooter, they should tell all the Secret Service agents to get Trump out of there. Did they do that? No.  But the sound of the bullets that hit Trump came from his own Secret Service agent, whoever the sniper for working for him, on this roof, and he's firing 400 feet away to another sniper that works for them. Here we go. We're gonna hear this guy fire, and he's gonna go down saying he got the bullet.
<br>
<br>['Trump' speaking, which is not important - what matters is the sound of the 3 shots, which from the visible recoil in the video, clearly show they come from his own Secret Service agent's gun, on the roof behind him]: And you know that's a little bit old, that charge, a couple of months old, and if you want to really see something that's sad, take a look at what happened...
<br>
<br>Video narrator: Okay. three shots came from this gun. No bullets went into that direction. Let's play it again.
<br>
<br>['Trump' - repeat of above clip.]: And you know that's a little bit old, that charge, a couple of months old, and if you want to really see something that's sad, take a look at what happened...
<br>
<br>Video narrator: That's one. [pausing the video]  You see the gun move? That's one bullet. [playing/pausing video] There's two. [playing/pausing video] And three.  You saw the gun move three times. And Trump is down. So the sound of the bullets came from this sniper.[Pointing mouse at Secret Service agent on roof.] Told ya, didn't I? Came from this guy's gun.  You see the guy shoot three times. You see the gun flinch three times.  And you've seen him[Trump] come down. Did you hear any other bullets come from the other direction? No, you can't. Why? Because this guy supposedly just shot him.
<br>
<br>01:01:08
<br>
<br>Sunny: I wonder who was recording that.
<br>
<br>Kim: I know - well, everybody's got a cell phone these days. Everybody's leaking information these days. So, I mean, who knows?  But the point was, there were no other shots fired prior to the alleged Secret Service agent firing bullets. Right? Now the other thing is, those guns do have a lot of recoil, in other words you see the kickback. But normally people that would handle such a rifle, would actually be able to handle such a rifle - because you can see that the second shot probably went down into the ground. I mean he did not hit his target I can tell you with the second or third bullet for sure. But nobody [else] fired first.
<br>
<br>And why - if that kind of situation was going on, they all have ear pieces.  That's not just for the movies. Of course they do. Why didn't anybody tell them to immediately get the president off the stage? Immediately. Shooter, shooter. Alert, alert.  Or get him down or something. You know, but then the three shots allegedly were fired. He allegedly grabs his ear from that point and then falls to the ground.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Yeah.
<br>
<br>Kim: Were there three other shots? No! Doesn't appear to be.
<br>
<br>But! We have some more information. Before I show this video to you, I want to tell you a story. Now, this was a situation where I had actually gone to California, and I think I might have told part of the story before.  I had gone to California to go meet with, at the time, one of Obama's aides. Now this is when I didn't know really that presidents were evil and, you know, gee, this guy could be a good guy, but no. I met with one of his - I used to call her by a code name, Psychic, because when I met with her, she was obviously not 100% right. But anyway, so I leave this meeting, and I thought the meeting went okay, but apparently it didn't. Because the next morning, I go back to my hotel at night, I probably grab some dinner, and then the next morning I get up and I go down to the lobby where there was a Starbucks in the lobby.
<br>
<br>And they opened at like, I don't know, 6 o'clock, this is like 5:30, 6 o'clock in the morning. And I go down to get a cup of coffee, and there's all these guys that are clearly not your regular people that hang out and get coffee at a Hilton at 6:30 in the morning, you know, 6:00, 6:30 in the morning. So one guy is about 6' 5", older guy, tall, bald, you know I mean I could pick the guy out of a crowd of a thousand today because that's just me. The other guy was a younger guy, clearly a guy probably in training, couldn't have been more than 25 years old, that kind of thing. And then I see about four or five more in different areas, reading a magazine, and all the kind of normal crazy stuff you actually see in a movie, but it's real, like sometimes that happens - at least when you're dealing with people like this.
<br>
<br>So I see, I turn around I got my coffee, and I see the older guy signal to the younger guy to move and what he did was he flipped his hat you know tugged on his hat like three times or whatever it was and then kind of wiped his forehead like he was sweating or something.  And I'm like, okay, and then the guy starts gets up and gets up and moves. I'm like, okay, so there's something going on here and I'm a part of it, and I don't really like this. So I started to - I called somebody, so I was on the phone with another person, and just chit-chatting about this and that, because you never know what's going to happen until I could try to figure out where I was going to go and what I was going to do.
<br>
<br>So I walked outside a little bit and, you know, there's never a day where, you know, the streets and never a time really where the streets of, Long Beach, California are not busy, at least to some degree, you know? And so I walk out there, I kind of like was walking around.  I was looking for a bank is what I was looking for because, in this, these particular type areas, all banks have a direct feed on their video cameras in the parking lots that goes straight to the FBI, so I thought well at least they'll get the footage, not like they're probably not in on it together, but who knows you know?
<br>
<br>But it's less likely that something's going to happen if you do pull - and that is a public safety thing so you know ladies or anyone if you ever feel like you're being followed or in trouble, pull into a bank parking lot, if you can find one.
<br>
<br>Also, Walmart parking lots are also direct feeds to the FBI as well, because they find more criminals shop at Walmart than anywhere else. I know, seriously, that was actually the statement that was made to me. I'm like, why is this a direct FBI feed? What are you talking about?  And they said, well, because more criminals shop at Walmart than anywhere else.  Apparently you steal somebody's money or rob a bank, and you go straight to Walmart and get yourself a TV. I don't know.
<br>
<br>But anyway, the point is is that - and then the other guy kind of hangs back, and you can see him there kind of following to see if the other guy is getting close enough to me. But it turns out after, let's just say, interesting and unpleasant conversation, this young man was supposed to spray me with what they call a tracking spray.  And a tracking spray can mean a number of different things in this world, but for regular people, it's basically something they spray on you, where they can actually detect where you are at all times, your clothes, so it never actually happened and whatever.
<br>
<br>But the signaling thing is a real thing when you know there's no communication or talking or an ability to do that and you're running some kind of operation you clearly shouldn't be. Right. So, let's talk about signaling, because this is really interesting. And please excuse the background person talking over this video.  There is some swearing, so just for warning.
<br>
<br>Video narrator: No, watch this shit, dude. Watch. Watch. She sits down. Yep.  Watch this. Puts the sign up. She's completely normal. And then watch. What the fuck?  What the fuck? People are freaking out. She's just like right there. She's not even freaking the fuck out. What the fuck?
<br>
<br>01:08:09
<br>
<br>Sunny: Wow.
<br>
<br>Kim: So the point is, is that this lady is sitting there calm as a cucumber, she sits down, she looks over in the direction of where the alleged shooter was, holds up the sign, brings it up pretty high, remains calm - so who was she looking at? Was she looking at the Secret Service guy? Was the shooter one of theirs? That's what this other guy claims, who knows? And it's now time then immediately after she picks up that sign. Then the bullets - you hear the three shots.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Yeah.  Then she starts recording.
<br>
<br>Kim: Because she knew there was no bullets flying in that direction. Everybody else was concerned they were also going to get shot. And probably also concerned about the presidential candidate. But, I mean, this lady didn't even move. Nothing.  Let me videotape this, so I can have the most popular TikTok channel in the world, I'm sure she was thinking, right? No. Come on.
<br>
<br>Okay, now, more signs we're being scammed. There's a tweet that had gone out multiple places. It went out through the 17 Letter People.  It went out through this other channel here, Val Thor. It went out for the Currency Reset on Rumor Mill News. It's been seen - but let's take a quick look at this this one here I think is from Valiant Thor, which reposts everything that's on the Currency Reset, and this was actually posted I think yesterday - no today, this morning.  It says:
<br>
<br>THE MOVIE IS JUST ABOUT OVER
<br>NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE GREAT aWAKENING
<br>A WEEK TO REMEMBER
<br>TRUST THE PLAN
<br>THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT TRUMP
<br>WERE SHOTS HEARD AROUND THE WORLD
<br>NO NEED TO PANIC
<br>ALL PLANNED
<br>
<br>They're telling you! These are from the Q people, these are the Trump people, these are your Secret Space Program people. They're telling you that we planned all this. Not that the potential events for the rest of the week were also quote-unquote all planned.  But to get what type of a response?  And then, this shooter guy, this alleged guy that is just the enemy of America, he is just killing the Savior all this kind of stuff - also took out the time - took the time, excuse me - to act in a BlackRock commercial!  Here we go:
<br>
<br>Narrator: My name is Brian Delalo. I teach AP and Honors Economics in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Financial well-being to me is knowing that I can be free to do the things that I love to do. I hope that when I retire someday, they say, you know, that guy made this place a special place to come to school and gave as much as he could to help the community. [Arrow pointing at student, who is apparently also the Trump shooter]
<br>
<br>Sunny: Okay, so question, because I've heard different reports - at least what's being reported in this area - is that it was a young kid, like, I don't know, not even of age yet, under 21, that was being blamed for shooting, firing the shot. Has that narrative changed?
<br>
<br>Kim: It changes quite rapidly these days.
<br>
<br>Sunny: It's like, maybe they saw the BlackRock commercial and were like, "Oh, crap! We can't have that actor, we gotta change this!"
<br>
<br>01:12:08
<br>
<br>Kim: Well, and then, I mean, as it was happening, like within minutes, they automatically said it was a Chinese national. I find myself being, this being reminiscent of that bridge explosion, on the border between US and Canada. No, it's a Saudi passport. No, it's an Iranian passport. I don't know, there's a passport there.  And they're from the Middle East, and I guarantee you, because they're from the Middle East, they must be a terrorist.
<br>
<br>Which country are we going to blame? That's all it really is. You know, how do we get the most bang for our buck here?  Why say that this guy is under age?
<br>
<br>Sunny: And dead. So you can't get any information out of it really. You can't be questioned or whatever. It's another thing they love to do. Oh, he's dead.
<br>
<br>Kim: Yeah, if they were alive.  It's like buying a cheap pair of something-or-others, and then go to return it and the company's out of business. Well, sorry! And that's kind of how I feel with this situation. I mean, it really is so... bad.  And with the situation that happened with Reagan, with the situation that happened with JFK, we didn't have social media then.
<br>
<br>The last time they pulled this stunt was in the 80s. We didn't have all this stuff now - we didn't have YouTube. Everybody has a phone with a video camera on it.  We definitely didn't have that back in those days, in any way, shape, or form. I mean, we had some big clunky video cameras back then that were home cameras. But most people didn't have them and they were very expensive at the time.
<br>
<br>So, we've got so much information going everywhere right now. It's the same thing with the Grassy Knoll, and the shots were fired from a different angle.  There's no way that the guy on the Grassy Knoll - but he just happened to spend a whole stint in Russia, and loves Communism, and then came back to America to sit on a grassy knoll and shoot the president. And nobody noticed that either!
<br>
<br>And that was ridiculous, back then. And the conspiracies have run wild since the early 60s, on who shot JFK? They talk about it all over the media.  So are they gonna talk about this quite a bit? I'm gonna tell you that the Duck Dynasty is already on that. They've got everybody out there, probably paid a few hundred bucks here and there. Basically saying that, hey, you do this little video, influencer person. I think it's like $60 for a video like that on TikTok. It doesn't cost you much.  And these people are out of money, so that about fits. And then they'll take those average everyday persons, and a whole lot of them, for 60 bucks a pop, and they'll all make a video about, oh, we hate the Democrats, go Trump - now I'm definitely voting for Trump, and blah, blah, blah. I mean, it's so cheesy.
<br>
<br>Of course you need some wine with that cheese too. And the wine actually was an interesting chain of events that happened over the weekend here behind the scenes.  So the wine part came - and I didn't quite get it at the time - but they were high-fiving each other, you know the Trump operatives, and basically saying, "Now look at all the money that's gonna come rolling in!" Well the following morning they didn't get the donations they thought they were going to. Number 1, anybody who's anybody that has any kind of money of significant amounts, like $30,000, $30 million, $20 million, knew about this ahead of time. They all have intelligence agencies where they are. Nobody has that kind of money.
<br>
<br>And we certainly don't have that kind of money as average everyday citizens, most of us anyway. And if you do, you're probably in on the 'in crowd', meaning you knew the jig is up, you knew what's going to happen next, and where are you going to put your money from here to preserve yourself or whatever it is, and that the banking system is going to crash. And as far as every average everyday persons, they really didn't get a whole lot of donations at all. I mean like, not at all. I really truly think they overestimated the support that this guy has, at this late stage in the game.  You can only be told you know Peter and the Wolf, that the guy is coming back so many times, before he's not.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Yeah.
<br>
<br>Kim: And you've got a few diehards out there that will consistently talk about it, because it makes them money on YouTube, or it makes them money on Rumble. And sometimes the truth is unpopular, and I'm okay with being unpopular, as long as I'm not lying to anybody.
<br>
<br>Next, there was also a lot of talk amongst these folks as to who to blame. So the round robin game about young guy, old guy, this is the guy, that's the guy, is no surprise here, because they don't know how to get the most bang for their buck.  But they were also expecting a large influx of money to take place over the weekend, based on things that they saw happening that they thought was going to yield them a different result.
<br>
<br>And this is where the worst part of the whole weekend comes in. But nonetheless, nothing worked out the way that they thought it was going to work out. They were told that bottom drop-dead date would be today for them to see the final changes, which didn't happen. But I am gonna say that now I would say a lot more makes sense to me.  Like, why do they, how do they know this stuff? Why do they think there's going to be a quantum flip? What actually is that anyway? And [break in stream] tied to Trump operatives because they're SSP, they're Secret Space Program, they're from thousands of years old organizations that have a lot of hidden knowledge that we are not privy to.  And there's a reason why they have that hidden knowledge.
<br>
<br>So, without further ado, let me give you a little bit more of an update on what happened on Friday. So - and Thursday, started Thursday night. It, energetically-wise and everything else-wise, was probably one of the worst weekends I've had in months. Since a lot of the changeovers. So on Friday, our biggest concern was what we were seeing was another two steps back.  And I don't mean - nobody got into our system or anything like that, so that's all safe - but two steps back, I mean, it looked like there was more dark matter coming in than going out.  And when we go from 98, 99 percent, 100 percent, and then we're down to in the 70 percent, I'm like, what is going on here? So that gauge tells me something is about to, what I call throw up, or a standing order from the past which starts creating things in the future.
<br>
<br>So I'm watching where these people are going, this is on Friday, and I'm looking for the consciousness. So be careful what you wish for because you just might find it.  And it was good, I'm glad, I'm glad it happened, but it was probably, you know, when you wanna teach your kids lessons or something, you hope that they're not too painful.  Well, apparently Source doesn't necessarily think in that same manner... but it's okay, we're gonna roll with it! So the first thing I caught was Saturday morning, and these people were at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange doing a maneuver that looked similar to an event that happened prior to 9/11. In other words, vans, unmarked cars going in and out underneath the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Like, what the heck are they doing?
<br>
<br>Now, this situation was a potential location where I thought we were going to have another 9/11 moment with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. And I'm saying it in case they are still planning on it, because they're still planning on two more events this week, and I haven't quite figured out what they are.  Other than some esoteric things that we're talking about now. But it turns out they're moving in some equipment that they had found, or had, that had been given to them by the Abraxas. For a time quote-unquote such as this.
<br>
<br>01:21:31
<br>
<br>So, they were switching out old equipment that was in there, moving in this equipment, because they thought that the big event that they were waiting to happen this weekend was of course financial system takeover, and all of this kind of stuff.  Now again, I will repeat what I said on Friday - these people are either really stupid, or the most evil sons-of-beepers on the planet. Now I'm beginning to think they're the most evil sons-of-beepers on the plane that there is. And there's a definitive reason for that.
<br>
<br>So, from that location that led us to a few other places in the world, one of which was in Maine, actually.  We also went to a place in Cincinnati, the Spring Grove Cemetery. We went to Albania, International Park there, Butrint I think it's pronounced. We were also in Stolak looking at some medieval tombstones. We went to a lot of grave sites.  And some of the places were places that they were and some of their places some of them were places that they were not.  We also went to Kazakhstan, Turkestan. We went to Kalispell, Montana, there's an area there. Afghanistan, Myanmar. And then we were off to find some more things.
<br>
<br>So, underneath these particular locations - not the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, but some of the other ones - there were some large machines, and the chatter from the people that were working in there, that  - they wore lab coats, they were scientists of some sort - was that this was like an event that had not happened for thousands of years. Turns out, the last time this happened was 250,000 years ago, and it's what gave the six owners of Earth an extension for 250,000 years. We were supposed to be out of the Dark Age 250,000 years ago. And this was meant to set us back.
<br>
<br>So, back to consciousness. It's important to understand. So consciousness transfer isn't just for consciousness. Some beings in the multiverse were allowed to actually do a full being split. Kind of like if you've ever seen a starfish, if it cuts off its leg, you know, it'll grow another leg and then a whole starfish will grow out of the other piece of the starfish.  Well, there are certain beings in the multiverse that had permission to do the same. And the same they actually did.
<br>
<br>Some of those beings being Marduk, Enki, Enlil. Anu had the ability. Lucifer had the ability to do that. And there are a few others we're going to go over here in just a second. So not only were there large pockets that we were finding on Friday and Saturday of - it's almost like a being without shape and form is the best way I can describe it.  It has all the characteristics without having... and it does have physical matter to it, it does. You can actually see it with your own eyeballs, it's not like, you know, it's like an esoteric kind of thing, like oh it's just in the ether. No no no, it actually has shape and form.
<br>
<br>If you are very connected, you would see these things, kind of like you see the Tarzakians. And the Tarzakians are the smoky beings that you see out of the corner of your eye, the moving shadows where there's nothing to be a shadow of. But these things are much more dense and larger. The Tarzakians look the way that they look because they are 8th Density, Lower Astral beings, which means they are etheric.  So you're actually seeing an etherical being in your home or around some other people. I see them around as protectors almost, for some pretty dark beings.
<br>
<br>So these folks here were allowed to do that to some degree, meaning they could occupy multiple spaces at the same time.  I would say the only one that was different of that particular group would have been Lucifer. Now Lucifer and a few other demons here, Baal, Baphomet, Belial, yeah we're in the B people. Asmodeus, Andromalus, if I'm saying that right, Beelzebub, Mamun, Astaroth, and Azizel.  These demons had the ability to split like a starfish.
<br>
<br>So we call them demons on the one hand, and then we call them demonlets. So, well, to some degree because eventually even out of the leg of the starfish, an entire starfish grows. Now, these beings could inhabit a human being. They could inhabit beings anywhere all the way up to the Sixth Density.
<br>
<br>01:27:12
<br>
<br>They could act alone and not even be in a human. They just don't grow as fast.  So being in a human - having that energy source - allows them to grow faster. They of course try to make deals all the time. And sometimes people with egos buy it. They allow for the inhabitant to be inhabited by one of these beings, and therefore you become part of it. And it's like a way to have your very own Baal, so to speak, collective consciousness.
<br>
<br>It could also inhabit a planet. And have influence on the creation or destruction of that planet.  It will also have a computer program attached to it, for every single soul that it splits off. Now these beings are old. They've been around for billions of years. This is not new. Imagine how many little starfishlets they made during the timeframe, and it's an awful lot.  Now, don't pass out or anything, but it turns out that 25% of the people on this planet have a soulet from one of these beings.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Oh my gosh!
<br>
<br>Kim: Yep.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Would they know it?
<br>
<br>Kim: Yes, they absolutely know it. Because, I don't know, when we spoke to Agent M, and he was talking about his discussions with Mayer Rothschild. If he didn't tell you, I'll have him come back on and explain it to you and what it's like when you're talking to one of these people. It's almost like you're talking to two different people. Now, once you're a walk-in, or you make yourself available to these people, I should say, when you make yourself available to these people, then the next step is, anyone can walk in. Now, the next part that's interesting, and this is probably the reason why most people think of Black Magic - they think of this being done at night or on holidays - which is true to some degree. So, at nighttime, after sunset, the soul that's in that person can actually leave the person and exist out in the world.
<br>
<br>And that's when they do their work. Now it's always dark somewhere. It's always night somewhere. So that's where they can do their work.  They do work not for that person. They do work for the demon that sent them into that person. However, they are promised a certain amount of power and control for having this demon up in there. But as Agent M will tell you, that the voice changed when he was talking to him one time. He said that, you know, Lucifer doesn't mean anything to me, and this was Agent M, of course.  And he was trying to sell him. Because it's all about getting people to buy, so that you too can become a starfishlet. I don't know what to call all these things. They break off and then become a whole second being. So it's weird.
<br>
<br>But he said his voice immediately changed, and he said, "I am Lucifer." He started to tell him things about himself, and those types of things which nobody would actually know. It's not like it's in an intelligence file or anything like that. I mean, these are things where they try to hit your button to get you to go down, so to speak. But the same thing that I felt with Marduk, it was like, what is it you desire?
<br>
<br>They're always trying to sell you something and it usually comes in one of the following flavors. So there is control over your own soul. You know, that's one thing. There is also a soul influencing. You can control souls.  You can collateralize those souls. You can get other people to sell their souls to us, and we will make a deal with you. In this case, you're probably talking to Baal, the controller of frequency, the controller of, get this, the sound of silence.
<br>
<br>Sunny: I think there was a song called that.
<br>
<br>01:32:19
<br>
<br>Kim: There was a song. Yeah. You'd be better off singing it - everybody's gonna hang up if I try. Well, because if the frequency, you know, everybody thinks frequencies, and they think about these tones that they play sometimes and that kind of thing, both positive healing and negative. And a lot of that would come from Baal.  He was the frequency manipulator and with frequency you can manipulate matter on an etherical level that will eventually influence your physical person.
<br>
<br>You don't make a physical change in the world, but it's mainly used for etherical changes in your body. You feel it as a spiritual change sometimes if you have positive frequencies. This goes in the other direction. It was a lot of power to manipulate the way things work in the world because everything has an etherical control.
<br>
<br>It's one of the highest planes. You can change somebody's mind. You can do things like inception. What is it that you want? My last run in with Baal, other than in the last 48 hours, Baalettes, I had Baal and Baalettes.  My last run in was where things started changing. It would have been February of... I think it was 2020, if I recall. And the argument at the time was that he was basically telling me about all the wars he helped start, all of the leaders he tore down, all that kind of thing. All the changes he made in the world, and I felt like I was watching an infomercial, or one of those video resumes, because he was offering me all kinds of stuff. And I said, no, thank you, I got this.
<br>
<br>But I didn't really run into the rest of them - at least not that I'm aware of - until the last three or four days.  Because at the same time, the certain people with the, you know, the Q People out there, were talking about quantum flip, it's happening, that kind of thing, and the increase of dark matter - who was actually doing the increasing and where was it coming from? And that was the frustration you were hearing in my voice on Friday.
<br>
<br>So it turns out that all of these beings and their consciousness and their consciousness-lets - their little 'lets', their babies, I don't know what you call them - because a lot of them aren't babies anymore, they look just like the original now. They've been up in there so long. And it's not just humans on Earth. This is throughout the multiverse that this can happen.  So it's a lot of beings that had an infection.
<br>
<br>So the next one I had run into, the one I found the most interesting, let's start with that, was Beelzebub. His main presence here on Earth was actually in Mount Kuhgrat, I hope I said that correctly, in Liechtenstein. It's spelled K-U-H-G-R-A-T. Beelzebub was actually the Lord of Lords and the King of Kings.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Wow, that's not usually attributed to him, it's usually attributed to Jesus.
<br>
<br>Kim: No, no.  But unfortunately, remember how they twist everything around on you?  He called himself the Kingmaker. He was the controller of governments, political, his sector was the power center. Also Family members. He would have been the one in charge of the Family members, believe it or not.
<br>
<br>01:35:59
<br>
<br>He was equal to - according to itself - equal to Lucifer in power. And he tried to sell me a lot of stuff. He tried to sell me, "We'll make you the king of whatever country you want." Or queen I should say, of any country you want. "We can do this, you wanna have governments, I can give you governments. All you gotta do is take this up in your body."
<br>
<br>I'm like, oh no, no my friend. Off you go! Off you go!
<br>
<br>Sunny: Well, was this a proposal recently or is this a long time ago this happened?
<br>
<br>Kim: 24 hours ago.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Oh, okay. So still wheeling and dealing after all these years.
<br>
<br>Kim: Still wheeling and dealing, that's Beezlebub. Don't get Beezlebub and Baal confused. They like B words apparently, you know, tongue twisters. So there was a lot of interesting conversations that we had.  Now another one you'll find interesting is Azazel - I think I'm saying that right, I'm not really good with these pronunciations. Azazel had a few different charges on this planet.  And one of them was he was the controller of knowledge. And I know that because when I went to Stonehenge in England where he was, he tried to tell me he would give me knowledge beyond my wildest dreams.
<br>
<br>"I can give it all to you. You'll know more than anyone in the whole world." So on and so forth. But the second thing that Azazel controlled was money. Greed and money.  In the system, there was a program tied to him, and therefore money - what we call money. Debt. The more of it you have, the more of a potential connection you have to Azazel.
<br>
<br>I know it's dastardly. And these were part of the curses that were on money. Now those bankers that we know as banksters and those types of things - on the highest level of course, not necessarily down the bottom - probably all have agreed to this second oath.  This is how you got to 25%. That's a lot of people in the world. And we're talking about the high-level bankers. We're not talking about the people that are tellers at your bank and that kind of thing.
<br>
<br>So yeah, it's just very interesting how everybody - not everybody tried to make a deal.  Once we went through the first several of them, they eventually, it was like, well, okay I'm going. I'm out. Some of them didn't fight, some of them did fight. These ones tried to negotiate. Amon, who happened to be in the ruins of Hathra in Iraq. He did fight.  Yeah, he did fight. He promised me he was gonna reign in hell and all this kind of stuff, and you're gonna get this, and you're gonna get that, and I just didn't, I didn't listen.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Is this, Kim, telepathic communication? Like how is this occurring?
<br>
<br>Kim: Well, and here's the thing. So there's one language that is the base root language for the entire universe. It's a Light language. It is a series of frequencies that are spoken. It's the same language that folks up near Source speak.  It's the same language that they speak all the way down. It's just the base root language of the Universe.  And it's more of a frequency kind of thing. But if you don't speak that language, then 99% of the time, your communications between other races, other people are all telepathic. Everybody speaks telepathically.
<br>
<br>We are the only folks in probably the entire multiverse that does not. At least not all of us - some of us do, not all of us do. And we've been prevented from doing so, probably for that reason. So even if you're standing in front of someone face to face, 99% of the time it's telepathic.
<br>
<br>If you were standing in front of a Marduk, it would be tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, you know, like, it's like, you don't even, like, what is that?  Like, it's not like you can go get a Rosetta Stone tape before you go and have this meeting and everything will work out. It doesn't work out that way.
<br>
<br>So that's what we pretty much spent most of the day, Saturday and Sunday doing, was cleaning up messes and little Marduklets, which were in a few places in the world. Along with Enki, Enlil, and Marduk - I'm sorry - Enki, Enlil, Marduk, Artemis, and the Abraxas.
<br>
<br>01:41:22
<br>
<br>Sunny: Okay, so how does that actually work? Because you said that they were, you know, there are little versions of them in various places. So is there still a central being or something that is connected to all of those that you can get rid of one and all the littles go away? Or is it a matter of having to somehow get the littles?
<br>
<br>Kim: Well. Here's that theory - and we're living that theory right now - because yesterday it was all about finding all of these what we thought was the main locations. So we found the main locations on Earth for each one of these, and then we found the main locations in our solar system, because they were on other planets as well.
<br>
<br>So then we looked down into the Lower Astral, and then we looked into computer programs.  Because each one had a piece of Omega, which allowed them to replicate themselves, as well as control themselves in all of these locations. A place for standing orders, a place to give - not only in ones that were inhabited, but ones that were not inhabited, could still make decisions. So why did we keep cleaning and cleaning and cleaning? You know, I guess everything has its day in the sun, or it's time to go. But, these things were able to create.
<br>
<br>Why did some of the Deep State feel like there was gonna be an event on a certain day?  And that there could possibly be a change or a flip?  And that's because they have one of these beings up in there.  And just like your fingers talk to your brain, and vice versa, their being could be in the Sixth Density in some other planet somewhere.  Their being could be mainly here on Earth. It could be someplace else in the Omegaverse. It could be anywhere. You never know where you're going to find it. It could be hidden in a little tiny crystal or a prism in the middle of space somewhere.
<br>
<br>You know, that's a small soul cube or a soul prism or whatever it is that you don't even know where it could be. So it's hopefully, the theory was, is if we get the main beings, then perhaps that will solve the problem with the rest of them. But I would say in the last 12 hours I have seen a lot of glitching. I have seen an enormous amount of backlash. And I mean enormous.
<br>
<br>Part of the reason why I didn't sleep is we actually almost lost Agent M, last night my time.  So then within a couple of hours of that, it was now I'm having troubles here and there, and I've got to go out and search out what we're looking for here. I would say my experience is - was there a disturbing feeling? For example, if I cut your fingers off, your brain is gonna be disturbed, your eyes are gonna be disturbed, your body's gonna feel disturbed, your neurological system is going to be feeling an enormous amount of pain throughout your body, that kind of thing. So I definitely know for sure - because it wasn't long after we cut off some - you know, the main part - that everything else started to fight. All the little ones of all of these beings started coming out of the woodwork.
<br>
<br>Do they have the ability to jump out still? Yes, because they're beings unto themselves. Again, they grow another starfish. The best way I can describe it to you. So, they are autonomous.  They can act as a team, as a group, or they can act alone. The best way I can describe it. So yes, the next round started at about midnight, a little after midnight last night, where we now had to clean them up because now you have to go out there and you actually have to create something where they all go back to Source and let Source sort them out.  Because it didn't appear that they were going to stop.
<br>
<br>But the ones that were 100% infected with something or another, meaning they don't have anything left of their own soul, they have nothing left of their own being, are feeling the most amount of pain. You know, and these would be your Bloodline Families, your Bankers as an example. You know, there are others here that offer power, that kind of thing.
<br>
<br>There are some, if you read up on these different beings that we're talking about, there's a lot of talk about - some control music, some control, you know, so no surprise there, as far as what you see on TV and people disappearing and that kind of thing and when their contract was up to be completely gone. Because soul contracts are definitely a real thing.  And they tried, like I said, three of them tried to get me to enter into something with them, and that's an absolute no from me.
<br>
<br>Sunny: It's interesting, and I know we were talking about this earlier before we started recording, but there have been, like over the last handful of days, celebrities disappearing, dying. Shannon Doherty passed away, Richard Simmons passed away. Was it Dr. Ruth? We're talking about Dr. Ruth passed away. I don't know. Do you think we might see more of this? Do you think this is somehow connected to that?
<br>
<br>Kim: You never know with these people. I'm assuming that not all of the agencies were infected - that there are regular people that work there. That being said, there are mask-making factories, so I'm not sure if they're going to see, who needs to stay around, who's useful to them, who do they feel is going to play the part the best. There is also Andromalus, he was also in control of the physical plane, so could they make another person? Could they make themselves look as if they're the same person, if they need to keep them around?
<br>
<br>01:48:17
<br>
<br>Sunny: Wow.
<br>
<br>Kim: Could they mimic it? Could they show that it's so-and-so walking around, if it's really not? You know? Entirely possible. It's a lot of power.  So, mainly, that is what we have been dealing with.
<br>
<br>And an interesting thing that happened, and I just thought I would mention it in case anybody felt kind of some weirdness. Saturday, there was definitely a point where all these machines were firing - until we found them all on Saturday - which sort of made you feel like you were maybe going into another dimension. Maybe you felt like you were out of sorts, out of reality, disconnected.
<br>
<br>I heard a lot of reports of that on Saturday because these machines are actually capable of - obviously not human made - but the humans, or whatever was up in there was aware of it, and they were capable of ripping the fabric of reality to create voids in between spaces, or zeptoseconds, I mean it's very small spaces, in the fabric of reality, in our Light fabric of reality, in order to allow darkness to creep in and then multiply.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Wow.
<br>
<br>Kim: Yeah. The darkness that's put in there could be controlled by any one of the demons. So when we say that 25% are pretty well not people anymore, or they're going in and out of that person, whether it be by you know you see sometimes you can look at a person and they look different, that kind of thing, and then you know really angry or something. And on top of that, now this is the part where I kind of fell off my chair - 80% had been infected in just 24-48 hours by these machines.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Is that in addition to the, what did you say, the 50% or 25%?
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>No, 25% is part of that. But a total of 80% had had the fabric of reality separated, to the point where it was ripe for one of these guys to come in and put an implant in there. Now, think about things that they have influence over, you know, they have influence over the mental plane, the etherical plane.  I mean they say by consent, but what is consent? Receiving money, could that be consent? I mean, it's very tricky with these folks and how they trick to accepting something like that.
<br>
<br>Now, we've worked really hard to reverse a lot of that out, plus get the main beings that were responsible for it. Did we get them all?  Not sure yet, still working on it. This was as of yesterday and this morning, worked on it some more. We'll be working on it all afternoon and probably drinking a lot of tea or coffee.
<br>
<br>Sunny: So with the main beings that you were targeting, is there any chance that they could somehow come back in another form? Or, I know it's hard to answer those questions if this stuff was going on!
<br>
<br>Kim: To answer your question. If it has completely gone back to Source, if that actually happens, and we have no little, little 'lets' out there, then I would say probably not, without the permission of Source.  Now, I don't think that's gonna happen, because there's nowhere to get permission from, and their ship has sailed. And trying to trip the trigger to redirect us back to set us back 250,000 years where we go into the Dark Ages, is also not a permitted thing.
<br>
<br>So you know it's painful. I mean I guess everything in its own time. It's something we had to learn. I don't know.  I'm frustrated. But I do want to point out something as well for you that I mean the people that are watching this, so they can understand how they do the things that they do.
<br>
<br>So when I approached and located Beezlebub there, the song that I heard playing at the time - because they try to convince you there's something positive - it's not the version of Hallelujah that you hear a lot in, like you heard in Shrek, and I don't know who sings the original one there, I know the Celtic girls, but if you've been to church there's a different version of Hallelujah that you sing Hallelujah praise Jesus King of King Lord of Lords, it's that kind of thing I'm terrible at singing Sunny, you should probably do this for me. You're way better at this than I am.
<br>
<br>01:53:52
<br>
<br>Sunny: I don't think I know the song.
<br>
<br>Kim: You don't think you know it?
<br>
<br>Sunny: I don't think so.
<br>
<br>Kim: He shall reign forever and ever... No?
<br>
<br>Sunny: I'm sure I've sang it a gazillion times.
<br>
<br>Kim: Oh go look up the lyrics! I can't sing, I tell you! I didn't sign up for Baphomet's music program or whatever! So anyway, the interesting part is, he was pointing out the fact that billions of people in the world are talking about him. "Look at the great power I have."
<br>
<br>Sunny: When they think they're talking about Jesus. Yeah, I know. (Wow.) Yeah. No he was not Jesus, so don't take it out there. No, no, that's another being all together.
<br>
<br>Kim: Okay. So, the other way that they use us - and we talked about this around Easter time - but I'm going to bring it up again, because right now in the Islamic world they are celebrating a holiday called Ashura. Now at least that's the Shiite Muslims that do that, and basically it's the mourning for about 40 days, and the high time being these three days here four days. And how they celebrate this is it's almost like shaming themselves. It's shame and guilt for - Oh! did I lose you?
<br>
<br>Sunny: No.
<br>
<br>Kim: It's shame or guilt, for not being there when they murdered the grandchildren of Muhammad. So it's kind of like the Catholic extremists do. They walk around with a cross on their back and that kind of thing during Easter time to feel the pain of Jesus that Jesus felt. And they're doing much the same thing. But these emotions, and celebrating the death of a Light being of any sort on this planet, is basically what is causing some of the major disruption, because the little demons and the demonettes love it.
<br>
<br>Now one of the Beelzebub creatures that was in a man, also employed - I'm not going to say employed, who knows if he paid him, probably not - but there were thousands of people in different countries all over the Middle East that he had using power in the worship of death, of the Light, to propel their Black Magic, and to grow the demon-ettes that were tiny, maybe they're just growing, to make them bigger, grow fully, so that they could fully inhabit everybody on the planet.
<br>
<br>Same thing happens during Easter when everybody's mourning the death. A lot of people are out collectively worshipping death - whether they know it or not. Now, it's not intentional on everybody's part, but you're basically mourning or celebrating a death that happened thousands of years ago. Albeit sad, you're still focusing your intention on death.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Well, I wonder, Kim, if there's any kind of tie-in there with this so-called assassination attempt. (Kim: Yeesss! Very good!)  Because what I am seeing, I'm having flashbacks of 9/11. Yeah, I'm having 9/11 flashbacks and how they would pick these images, right, and show it constantly and tell us about danger and death. And just focus on that constantly. So it feels like, yeah, like there's a tie in as far as the timing, and all this Trump stuff.
<br>
<br>Kim: Yeah.  Again, now I'm gonna take all of these things, and I'm gonna take it one step deeper, so you understand how you can be manipulated, and how to avoid that. The thing that's been happening for the last couple of weeks is we are reconnecting to the Soul Plane. We are reconnecting to our real records. You can access those types of things. When events happen here in the Third Density, all your attention goes from doing the wild wonders and amazing things that human beings can do right down to a 3D-level.  Here you are focusing all your energy and attention way down here.
<br>
<br>And if you're way down here, you can't be up there at the same time. You know, most people can't. Some can, some do. And that's part of it.  But the other part of it too is it's preventing you from accessing all the wonders that are now acceptable to you. That are now out and available to you.
<br>
<br>It takes all these people from walking into a church, temple, or mosque, and asking God for the things they want, connecting to God, connecting to whatever name you call it. focusing on the needs of their family, of their lives, and thanking for the things that they do have, and all the things that we go to church when we say in our prayers, you know, every day. It takes you from doing that to focusing on death for as long as 40 days in some cases.
<br>
<br>It's okay to feel that there was a person in history whose life you want to celebrate. That's different.  But, you know, mourning every year? You know, I don't think I would want that for my child if that ever happened to me or will ever happen. When that happens, I mean, I want her to celebrate.  You know, have something fun.
<br>
<br>02:00:03
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Yeah. It's like when people wear a crucifix. Like when you see Jesus hanging from a cross. It's like, gosh, that's rough.
<br>
<br>Kim: Well, exactly. And you're sitting there - whether you know it or not - but you're walking around with a guy that did some pretty cool stuff here, and you're walking around with him dead.
<br>
<br>Sunny: So we're celebrating that, yeah.
<br>
<br>Kim: Well, it's like having a necklace made of a car crash, if one of your family members died in a car crash. That's ridiculous, who does that? No one takes a picture of a car crash, and has a statue made of the actual crash. Why do we do the things we do sometimes? But I'm just saying, as far as events like this, it's meant to drag you down. And keep you lower than you need to be or should be or want to be.
<br>
<br>It keeps you looking in the 3D for what's next too, because everybody has a prediction about today as an example. I mean was there some pretty crazy things that happened today? I'm gonna say yes there was. But you know, it was 5, 6, 7 hours, 8 hours later, it's okay. Everything's okay.
<br>
<br>You'd be surprised what you can achieve - you personally can achieve - when you can connect to that plane, or any of the other ones in between. You'll have a better understanding of yourself, of those around you, spouses, family members, other people that you have to interact with at work or choose to interact with in your private life and clubs, whatever it is you do.
<br>
<br>But it's that connection that will help you understand yourself, help you understand your power, and help you through the next phase of what's going to happen here. Don't let anybody drag you down into this hot mess. It's clearly a hot mess out there. But everybody's gonna be talking about it.
<br>
<br>Can't remember - what was the other event that happened?  Everybody was talking about it, just dissecting it, and video after video after video, and I'm like, come on, people. This is just another day ending in Y, another martyrdom act of - if they're not being convicted of this and now everybody's gonna vote for Trump, because Trump got shot in the face. (Jeez.)
<br>
<br>But I can't help but think you might have struck a nerve with a bunch of veterans out there.  Because anybody who's shot, or seen somebody get shot or you know I'm telling you, you know there isn't enough blood there, if you get hit in the head and an ear or whatever it is, to make that real.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Right.
<br>
<br>Kim: Then we just saw a guy shooting in the opposite direction - the only three shots fired. So I don't know. I don't really care - actually I only did this for you guys. Honestly I looked at it and I laughed, I'm like, here we go.  Raise some money, probably from a demon. I don't know. God bless them all.  Now he's touched by the hand of God. And yeah. I know.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Yeah, just in time for the Republican National Convention. I'm sure that was just a coincidence too.
<br>
<br>Kim: Oh I know! There's a speech today at 11 Eastern time.  So, how about that?  It's already started, Sunny, now.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Oh, I missed it? Oh man.
<br>
<br>Kim: Oh, I'm sure you can play it back and there'll be a big band-aid, maybe one with a flower like you know your kids get. Maybe it'll be the Simpsons, a Simpson band-aid, that would be fitting. (Wouldn't that be funny?) I know. Alright, well that's about what I can share with you for Monday.  So, hopefully we'll have a better week than allegedly everybody's saying. Because it's all planned, according to... I know, it's all planned. Way to go.
<br>
<br>Sunny: It's the end of the movie, according to Q. Gotta end with a big shebang!
<br>
<br>Kim: Yep, everybody gets their demon for you. You know, it's like the Oprah show.
<br>
<br>Sunny: You get a demon! And you get a demon! You get a demon! (both laughing) No, thank you.
<br>
<br>Kim: Yeah, we're good over here. We're good.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Totally fine. Totally fine.
<br>
<br>Kim: I'm on a demon-free diet, personally.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Alright, well thank you for that update, Kim.
<br>
<br>Kim: Thanks, Sunny.
