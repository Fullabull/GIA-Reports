        <br>2021-10-01-WSR-2x.txt
        <br>=====================
        <br>And I'll list off a lot of what Starlink is doing, which has nothing to do with the global currency reset and nothing to do at all in any way for anything positive for humanity. But I can go into some detail about what that does or what it's connected to so you understand it. The other thing that came up this week was some tethers, some ties to what you would call the black sun or the dark side of the multiverse, which had to be removed. There was some entities in there. It would be what you would liken to a giant Pandora's box, a limitless Pandora's box.
        <br>
        <br>But it's tied to when they lost actual what I call Helena box or Pandora's box right in the center of Earth. It has been replaced with a holographic projection coming from Sterling to make everybody believe that it's still there. It's tied to a group of what you would refer to as demons or gin, called the target the ends are target for Zacchion's. They're also called. They are definitely involvement there with Starlink there, we also found a VOC program, which can affect our air quality at any given moment in time, we also found, you probably have noticed in the news they're putting out a little bit of information about measles now.
        <br>
        <br>If you live in a remote area of the country, you would probably have been waiting for the launch of Starlink in September, right, so you could get better internet service. So, we found some holographic projections coming through the, let's call them the touch points, or the deltas, as you would call it, of the Metatron's cube and you can look up Metatron's cube and see what that actually is. So they put much what you would say an etherical device on these particular locations around the world. And they connected it to Starlink, it could affect the plasma level and the theoretical level of matter, mainly about humans. Okay, so this is, it's only been a couple of weeks, maybe tops, that this thing is actually been running.
        <br>
        <br>There is, it is. There is an energetic grid being held in place in the shape and formation of Neutron's cube, right? Which is a binding thing. And they have figured out somewhat of a way, it's an etherical machine, I guess, or device, device is plural, that are connecting to Starlink to some degree, even less of a degree as of the last 48 hours. But I see what these things are doing.
        <br>
        <br>We are still working on the disinfecting this week. You know, you find 1 thing and you think it's very small like an anthole, right and then you uncover the fact that there's this giant network of ant holes connected to it. So we've been working literally 20 hours a day on this for the last, you know, week to 2 weeks, week and a half. Okay, so let's talk about Starlink. So Starlink is mentioned a lot on the internet, right?
        <br>
        <br>===============================
        <br>2021-10-06_KAG-KerryCassidy.txt
        <br>===============================
        <br>All right, well, I'm sure that maybe it would be useful if he would come and if he watches this video and have a response. But taking you on your word for the moment that you don't want to come out here and lie to the public and etc, etc. Well, just let's move forward with that. So the idea is that again we've got generals that are not paid, they could have been paid today, Trump doesn't have access to what's called the Starlink system, which I thought was changing anyway. Isn't that the case?
        <br>
        <br>And we now understand that Trump has not supposedly paid the generals and we don't know the exact reason other than he doesn't have access to the Starlink system is the reason that you're saying, right?
        <br>
        <br>He had access to the Starlink system for a short time. Now Elon Musk makes $350 million a day and it's not selling Tesla cars. Okay? The Starlink system was siphoning money out of the banking system in Europe for probably damn near a month. So he had access to Starlink until the last few days.
        <br>
        <br>No, it's just a European pronunciation. So, OK, so, so you're saying, because we kind of got a little bit off track there. So coming back to the to the central idea here is that there are military people that have been denied payment, which are top generals, that sort of thing, by Trump. And supposedly, even though he had access to Starlink previously, he doesn't now, so he denied it recently. In other words, today, you said he refused to pay them.
        <br>
        <br>OK, well let's back up again. Are you you referring to the Starlink system that you talked about earlier as this system that's linked to Metatron? Metatron's Q. Okay, which in essence sounds like an AI to me. It is.
        <br>
        <br>Okay, as of today, goes like this. Okay, so There's a new database that I know about only because I built it, right? And you have the backside system, and we still have resistance from the front, from agencies, people that were connected to Metatron to Cube, Starlink, they are blocking us from getting money directly to your bank account. There's also Archon's, right? Architecture for cooperative heterogeneous systems inside the banking system, right?
        <br>
        <br>Okay, fine. You know, we obviously don't have 1 of those individuals here on the show with us at the moment, but we're stating this. I'm allowing you to come on my show and state this, and then they can certainly do basically, you know, a counter to that, whatever way they see fit, whether it's through 107 or other members of their organization. So you're claiming that Trump is not paying them and part of the reason Trump is not paying them is because he does he can't access the Starlink system is what you're saying?
        <br>
        <br>So I think it's really good for us as far as censorship and things like that, it's going to be a lot harder to do that, because they don't have access to a superior system anymore. And Starlink's also
        <br>
        <br>So you're saying that a man who has access to the Starlink system is promoting neural link technology and vaccines in Alabama on national television. Connected to the, sorry about that, get a little bit of cough. So connected to the black Metatron cube, okay, is going to save us all. And that's number 1. Number 2, I saw our lives getting nothing but worse.
        <br>
        <br>The technology that you're asking about, Elon Musk's Neuralink, connected to, that's what the Archon 2.0 is, it's Neuralink. And it's connected to that Starlink system. Now, all over the internet, you can see military contacts and whatnot saying the Starlink system, right? Talks about it everywhere. It's on them on denar.com or whatever today.
        <br>
        <br>They're not necessarily in our favor as humans, but they did serve a purpose for a time and I do understand that. So the looking glass technology would be related to this. So would this new system. So when Azure, which was hosting pretty much every bank in the world, went down, plus also the medical data systems and a number of other systems, Facebook and a few others were using Microsoft data center servers in Seattle and other locations around the world obviously. When that went down they started to try to connect all those systems to the etherical system in conjunction with Starlink.
        <br>
        <br>Why? Because he thought that this system, this Starlink system connection, was going to give him access to the back system. Now, he could have given each 1 of these individuals some of his own money, right? I mean, a few million dollars wouldn't have hurt him any. But he gives them 0.
        <br>
        <br>are saying he wanted access through the Starlink system to pay them through that system is that but he didn't
        <br>
        <br>want to access through the star link system to the back system so he could issue new allocations of money to pay these people and
        <br>
        <br>=====================
        <br>2021-10-08-WSR-2x.txt
        <br>=====================
        <br>And so this was the dark side's connection to the other side, I should say, to the light side of the multiverse. Now, Archon 2.0 was an offshoot of Elon Musk's Neuralink and some of the scientists that worked on it were actually very upset because they were told that it was for the good of humanity. You know, I've even talked to people in the insurance industry that said that knew about it and they said it was going to be for the good of humanity. So what's this whole, when Starlink was disconnected from other technology, they took this technology from some of the scientists with this, it's called it's black mirror theoretical plasma machine is basically what it is. And they had hooked up Starlink to it, and we're attempting to control our content 2.0, and many other systems, that is why we had the outage this week.
        <br>
        <br>Everybody is talking about. So if you haven't seen the interview with Carrie Cassidy, I can explain it in detail. I know a lot of people are trying to claim it's this person or that person, but if any of those persons that are claiming it's their tech would like to get on a live phone conversation, I can explain to you in detail how it actually worked, what it did and why it went down. So they had connected Facebook and you saw the outages that happened on that 1 day. It's not just Facebook, Telegram going up and down, Google going up and down, all to this, these etherical devices globally, and Starlink, and obviously to your person.
        <br>
        <br>That's where the Chimera come from, where the Archons come from. Humans created Archon 2.0, but they recently connected that machine, as I said before, to Starlink and Neuralink. So Archon 2.0, and Archon actually stands for Architectural Cooperative Aerogenous Online System, which basically puts your system online. Now, some of the scientists that actually work on the project have been in contact, by the way, and they were told that it was gonna be used to give us better healthcare, because Archons themselves have plagued the multiverse from, you know, eons, right? Not just Earth.
        <br>
        <br>To try to work on this. And he said, I would call her, but I can't get this box to work. So his approach was, well, I just need a call from Trump so bad, right, because I haven't answered the phone now for months. I need to call him so bad that I'm going to fix the Starlink system. Now the 1 that is a diplomatic line actually works just fine.
        <br>
        <br>We also removed Starlink and all its connections. And that's why everything went down all in the same day. And Tom had some meetings this week, but 1 of the things that was really important for everyone to understand. So we're down to that part. We have many more parts to go, but yes, all of this does affect the banking system.

        <br>=============================
        <br>Penny & Kim - Pre-Interview Part 1: Starlink, Mapping System, Etheric Devices and more!
        <br>
        <br>Penny: but i've heard you talk about sometimes you say star net and other times you say star link and i know how that is
        <br>
        <br>Penny: that's my understanding. starlink - is it starlink or starnet? i've heard it both ways
        <br>
        <br>Kim: i have - well, star link was an invention by elon musk or those people - let's put it that way yeah because he really he's just kind of that guy that um
        <br>
        <br>============================
        <br>2022-01-22_KAG-RobPotter.txt
        <br>============================
        <br>So when they talk about Starlink, for example, and the new quantum system, it's not the new quantum system; it's the old quantum system. And it all would have been directly connected to this negative AI, which they call themselves the good guys, but they don't really know what they're doing. And unless you're at the very tip top of this food chain here, you have no idea even what I'm talking about right now.
        <br>
        <br>Yeah, we're just misdirected by tinsel and trash, when we can really be creating something wonderful. And the great thing is, folks, the energies, the psychic energies - one of my, another contactee guy - he's super sensitive, and he was just—he didn't even know what was going on with your declaration because his psychic energy was off; he was just going off. So there's a lot of lack of impression now through these technologies, and you didn't really talk about your part in them, but the Starlink, the Google monitoring. So I want to go back more for some people who want to hear - the more materialistic people in the aspects of what we're seeing - and how we can support in our actions, thoughts, and deeds the gnosis of this unraveling. A lot of people are in fear about them monitoring everything. Now, you've mentioned that you've taken away from Google in certain areas, some of these control networks, and taken down their systems offline that have been instrumental in their attempt to completely monitor social crediting, and then if you had a vaccination, literally, it could be a kill switch within you.
        <br>
        <br>===============================
        <br>2022-03-15_KAG-KerryCassidy.txt
        <br>===============================
        <br>It's a mapping system and it connects directly to the universal Council, which are not reptilians. The other system would have been connected to your targettings your DARPA uses that the SSP uses that This is what Starlink was trying to connect to. So I can only guess because of the connection between DARPA, Starlink and the system, the other system, Because there is no connection for Starlink on the other side. You know, there is some hacking that goes on all the time, but I'm guessing that's the system they're talking about. Okay, well, that kind of doesn't make sense because in theory, that's who they're fighting.
        <br>
        <br>============================
        <br>2022-04-04_KAG-ChrisRice.txt
        <br>============================
        <br>According to his son, no. He's not going to. So they're keeping the rallies going to keep support for these alignments with these weird planets and their ritual things they do, thinking that they're going to put him back in and that Starlink is going to... I mean,
        <br>
        <br>Nope. It has to do with all DARPA's things that they're doing. Lots of problems with Starlink and integration. You know, Swift is theirs or was theirs. All of these other transfer systems were theirs.
        <br>
        <br>Okay and the Starlink thing is something definitely interesting, which we could touch on here in just a minute. Trying to multitask here with the screen, which is another reason why I want to do live, because when we did the live interviews, it kind of distracted me from completely focusing on our conversation 100% since I had to run the stream. So another reason why I wanted to record. The next 1 is representative of humanity for disbursement of planetary assets, which I guess would be the trustee, Manor World Holding Trust?
        <br>
        <br>Yeah, there's a DNA thing for sure. But the last part, it is the Alpha system. There was a contrary dark system called the Omega system, which is now pretty well dissipated. So there were was dueling systems I guess you would say on this planet and 1 of them would be the 1 that you see with Starlink and Elon Musk that one's gone now and then the Alpha system.
        <br>
        <br>=================================
        <br>2022-04-21_KAG-GeorgeIceman-1.txt
        <br>=================================
        <br>No, he actually we did an interview with 1 of his babysitters from when he was young and she flat-out told us that he used to play with demons and according to his mother that he is the chosen 1 to usher in the Antichrist and that's his job. Which is very, that is what he believes. He is the chosen 1 to usher in the Antichrist. So, Don't you find it kind of funny that, you know, all over the internet Starlink is ushering in the quantum financial system and so on and so forth, right? There is a definite connection there with a thousand percent certainty.
        <br>
        <br>Now he was supposed to do that in Conjunction with the Starlink system, right?
        <br>
        <br>Well, Elon, it says on all the websites, you know, Sarah to Sarah, the currency revaluation, all these things. It says that Trump is going to do the EBS and then blackouts are going to happen and you know financial systems going to crash which all do not sound very pleasant by the way. In the same sentence they also say the Starlink satellites are live and they're connected to the quantum system blah blah blah right well if Elon Musk runs or ran the Starlink system in cooperation with the military which is absolutely 100% true the control and command center for that part of it was, and I say was, on a deserted naval base in Texas. So that's why he moved to Houston, by the way, or wherever he, Austin or somewhere, Texas. So if you're putting 2 and 2 together here, I'll send you the link.
        <br>
        <br>=====================
        <br>2023-08-04-WSR-2x.txt
        <br>=====================
        <br>Oh, it's cryptocurrency is the latest greatest thing. And you know, it doesn't even phase these people back. They're talking about, excitedly, about the FedNow system. And they're talking about, which they did try to do, by the way, the Starlink new financial system. That's Elon Musk.
        <br>
        <br>You know, the guy that played with demons as a kid, you know that guy, and you're excited about being on his Starlink system. And part of the reason why they wanted to initiate that is because there used to be a crystal beltway, so to you it would look like space dust if you saw it, that would have been filled with dark matter during this time which would have emanated from the veins of gold in Earth. Well clearly that didn't happen, so the beltway didn't fire up anything, but that is where the Starlink system, just coincidentally, you know the guy that plays with demons put it right where that beltway was in our Earth's orbit. So at a future date when the lower astral would open up and all the demon friends would come back to play, he could then work the entire financial system of the planet in cooperation with the Order of the Dragon through his Starlink system.
        <br>
        <br>=====================
        <br>2023-09-11-WSR-2x.txt
        <br>=====================
        <br>I don't know. Yeah. I know. Makes you kind of wonder if anybody else lost their supposed Starlink satellite program over the last several days. Why were they told ahead of time that this was going to happen?
        <br>
        <br>I know, but you know what, funny enough, isn't it, you know, there's all this political talk about Elon's bad and all this stuff because he turned off the Starlink satellites in the Ukraine just a few days ago. Isn't it funny? Just a few days before launching his kill the world program, kill the humans, the kill the cattle program, that they just miraculously went off in the Ukraine. I mean, is there some kind of deal over there? What's that deal?
        <br>
        <br>I'll tell you what happens next. You start this morning with Starlink satellites and you start sending out frequencies through cell phones. That's what you do because that's gonna work. And we can literally microwave people through their cell phones. That's what they were trying to do?
        <br>
        <br>Yes, this morning. So because their bosses, so to speak, you know, their former bosses that are now no longer with us, failed to perform this function, they've been trying various haphazard ways of poisoning us all. Now the orders that went to Elon Musk in his Starlink program, satellites, in order to do this actually came from Rothschild. And he complied with said orders. I know.
        <br>
        <br>=====================
        <br>2023-09-18-WSR-2x.txt
        <br>=====================
        <br>Coming up, the world situation report with Kimberly Goguen from the Office of the Guardian. Everyone wants to talk about the dangers of 5G, 6G, and Starlink. But do you know why? It isn't the 5G that is dangerous. It was what it was connected to, and it was not human-made.
        <br>
        <br>Yes, there are other systems that can be created which are actually healthy for us, and healthy for plants and animals and those types of things. So, but the base root of why it was super dangerous, The same goes for Starlink satellite systems, by the way, that also includes these, had this connection to these different programs. But understanding why it was so dangerous and why it's not healthy for you necessarily, but it's not dangerous anymore. It's not going to kill us all. But when they say that It's tied to the mRNA and all of this fear stuff that goes around.
        <br>
        <br>=====================
        <br>2023-12-22-WSR-2x.txt
        <br>=====================
        <br>But next, as part of this operation, Elon Musk thought that his Starlink system was going to be able to connect to a quantum AI system because they were going to get that back as well. They were going to get Omega back and be the only quantum AI system on the planet. So that would have meant during this, apparently the Alpha system also was raptured at the same time. So that is what's been going on for the last 24 hours. A little bit tired.
        <br>
        <br>=====================
        <br>2024-06-28-WSR-2x.txt
        <br>=====================
        <br>Did the humans have any kind of control of that? No, they were just under the impression if they create war, evil things promote fear that somehow it powers a computer system.  That's what they thought. Or something. There would be a reaction from some kind of alien technology that would be in their favor. Not exactly true. And I'm probably not gonna expand much more on that, but to give you an idea, this is what Elon Musk was looking at connecting his Starlink system to, just in the last 48 hours.
        <br>
        <br>Now the system hasn't functioned in a very long time, but some... how do we say it? ... Humans, that believe very highly or think very highly of themselves, believe that they could turn it back on. Now, their hope was - and this is in the words of Elon Musk, and his SpaceX program and Starlink program, and all those other programs that he has - in his words, he thought that he could get ahold of the Triple-X System, hook up the Starlink system to it, and therefore have the computing power to operate this system, at least from a Level 6 on down, to then recreate a new financial system based on digital currencies.
        <br>
        <br>So did he have some knowledge of what cylindrical satellites did? And did he actually think that the ones that were connected to the Triple-X program were the ones indeed that he was looking for? And did he think - if he could connect his Starlink product, possibly with his Neuralink product, and those cylindrical satellites - that he could control all of humanity?  Well, probably.
        <br>
        <br>So, if they knew enough about it for the CIA to approve a movie about cylindrical satellites, then I guarantee you - to some limited degree - Elon Musk was trying to get his hands on it.  Do they know to the fullest extent what cylindrical satellites do? I don't know. And I'm gonna say, I don't think so. Because they thought that this Triple-X System, if they could get access to this platform in London under Piccadilly Circus, that they could then connect and utilize these satellites and link them to Starlink.
        <br>
        <br>Well, let's talk a little bit about this system. Starlink is capable, and its satellite systems are capable of helping you hook up to the Internet, at a speed that a human is used to. Not at quantum speeds. And by quantum, I'm not talking about Google Quantum Computers here - I'm talking about faster-than-the-speed-of-light fast. I mean multiple data transfers per nanosecond, I mean kind of fast.

        <br>=====================
        <br>Elon Musk - their buddy with the train that never came, by the way - also is now supporting the Trump administration. And Elon is also basically saying he's in serious trouble if Trump doesn't get elected. Which makes you wonder, how many deals behind the scenes is Elon Musk making on behalf of the hopeful in his mind new Trump administration? Well, let's just say they're extensive. Really, really extensive. He's put a lot of money out there; let's call them down payments. He has promised a lot of technologies. He has made a lot of behind-the-scenes deals on that little Starlink technology he's got.

        <br>It's Wednesday, the 23rd of October, coming up on today's Global Intelligence Agency Operations Report. The "Debt Call" continues with original bank deposits and assets seized. What exactly is the "Debt Call" and how does it affect the world? It's all a part of the changeover to a currency of gold, asset-based system. And in response to the debt call, the Secret Space Program operatives would love to crash the banking system as soon as tomorrow. Will they succeed? They certainly are starting a lot of rumors. We have heard everything from an alien invasion to a tone coming through your cell phone, courtesy of Elon Musk's Starlink. We are here to set the record straight.
        <br>
        <br>Next rumor. You are going to receive a loud frequency coming through your cell phone, which they are now calling the emergency broadcast system, and it's going to come through Elon Musk's Starlink technology. Well, poor Mr. Musk. You know, the Trump Organization operatives are really taking this guy out for a good run. But to be fair, his ego is running right along with them. God bless this man. He believes he's going to be the Order of the Black Dragon head, the Black Sun head. He also believes that he is going to be running the DUS currency, and now here we go: he's going to be able to send a frequency through cell phones worldwide to cause mass anger and panic. I think he might have watched the movie The Kingsman. Is it The Kingsman? Yes, it is. Where the Dr. Evil guy, scientist hands out free SIM cards to everyone, and then he decides he's going to send a frequency, which would cause them to become angry and start killing each other.

        <br>Oh, that's a long question. Let's just start with Mr. Musk. Oh, God bless him. Musk is involved heavily with the SSP. Musk is also heavily involved with their latest and greatest adventure, and that latest and greatest adventure would be their new ALLES AI system they think they're gonna be able to use. Elon Musk has also been told by the SSP that the entire world will run on his Starlink Satellite System, and eventually the entire financial system will run on that, which is also a lie and not possible. That's number 3 I think we're on now.
