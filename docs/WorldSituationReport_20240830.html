World Situation Report
<br>2024-Aug-30 News</h2>

<br>00:30:54

<!-- TEASER:-->

<h3>And now, the World Situation Report, with Kimberly Goguen from the Office of the Guardian. Today we will discuss the truth behind what has been happening in the Middle East, as we visit with our Global Intelligence Agency boots on the ground, Agent M. The Deep State operatives are playing a game of deny, deny, reassess blame when it comes to attempted currency manipulation. The problem is no one knows what they're doing. "Confessions of an Economic Hitman" book now has a sequel: "Confusion of an Economic Hitman." And today we'll learn why.</h3>

<br>Sunny: Now here's Kimberly Goguen with the Office of the Guardian. Hey, Kim, we made it to Friday.
<br>
<br>00:31:41
<br>
<br>Kim: Not like that means anything, but we did. And hey, guess what? The Deep State's getting paid today! Aren't you shocked?
<br>
<br>Sunny: They've been told that they're getting paid today, right?
<br>
<br>Kim: Yeah, yeah, you know.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Yeah. one of those days.
<br>
<br>Kim: We should probably introduce this segment. Hey, it's Monday. Guess what today is. Hey, it's Friday.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Yeah, exactly.
<br>
<br>00:32:05
<br>
<br>Kim: It's not funny, but it is funny. You know, I have to laugh a little bit, because I'm still waiting. I did this interview, if you haven't seen it, with George the Iceman the other day. And he mentioned to me that there is actually an occult reason why they pick those two days as being a payday. So I'm going to get that information. He hasn't sent it over to me yet. And then I'm going to share it with all of you, or have him come on and have him share it with you, because I got to know. At this point, I really would like to know why they do it every single week and why nobody seems to care. You know, they get angry, throw some stuff around. You know, by five o'clock today, they'll be really angry, Eastern time, and then that'll be it. They'll say, "Wait, just wait till Monday." They're like, "Okay..."
<br>
<br>Sunny: What in the world?
<br>
<br>00:33:01
<br>
<br>Kim: Yeah, and we're going to talk a little bit more about that in a bit here too. I've got a few things I need to cover today. But first, before we do that, I would like to introduce to you or reintroduce to you Agent M. Agent M has been on before. He is a part of the Global Intelligence Agency. He is in the Middle East region. He's all over the Middle East most days, so without further delay, welcome Agent M.
<br>
<br>Agent M: As-salamu alaykum, peace be upon you all, ladies and gentlemen. It's good to be back and alive.
<br>
<br>Kim: I know, it's been a rough couple of months, hasn't it?
<br>
<br>Agent M: Yeah, they tried; they gave it all, but I'm still here.
<br>
<br>Kim: I know! Well, congratulations! We both made it through another 30 days! [laughing]
<br>
<br>Agent M: I know.
<br>
<br>00:33:52
<br>
<br>Kim: Yeah, it was really rough there for half the month of June and half the month of July for Agent M. I know that for sure. Yeah, it appears that he's definitely still on the mend, to say the least there. So let's talk about what's been going on there. I've touched on it a little bit in the news as well. We talked about the false start in the Middle East. What is going on now over there? There was that incursion that happened, the ground assault that happened. We haven't seen something like that in over 20 years; I think it's 20 years now, as severe as it started out. Anyway, what is going on over there? What's the current status over there between Israel and Gaza?
<br>
<br>00:34:41
<br>
<br>Agent M: Well, as you all know, since October the 7th, the Hezbollah, I'm sorry, the Hamas did their thing and allegedly invaded Israel, which nobody can actually say that's true. It's been ongoing since then, and the people are suffering. I mean, now you have recently, in the recent days and weeks, bombs as big as a thousand pounds dropped on very compact locations where a lot of refugees are, and you have hundreds of people die every now and then. So that's the situation that's still there in Gaza. There's a shortage of food, a shortage of water. People have been trying to go even to fish on the sea of Gaza to try to feed their families, and they get shot at or droned. The Egyptian borders are closed. Nothing is actually flooding in from there, even though there are donations from across the world that can feed the entire population. They're just standing there. [unclear ->] They're going to get in.
<br>
<br>00:36:05
<br>
<br>And then you have the shenanigans of Americans, British, Jordanians, and whatever: C-130s dropping food from the sky; most of them land in the sea and become fish food. And so I don't comprehend the hypocrisy of we "bomb them and kill them" and "try to feed them" at the same time. So that's on one side. But recently what happened is an escalation that Kim talked about because of the phone conversation they twisted. Apparently, the Israelis decided to do a ground invasion of the West Bank. Now, the West Bank has been technically under the occupation of Israel for a very long time. The West Bank originally was part of Jordan and under the custody of Jordan, but then the Jordanians donated that part to the Palestinians so that they could be overcome by the Israelis. So recently, that's what happened in the past few days. They went in, and it's one of the biggest assaults since 2002. And what they have been doing is basically just spreading terror.
<br>
<br>00:37:25
<br>
<br>So they immediately started to demolish all the roads. They would use these large machines that would destroy roads - anything that can do movements, they would have snipers deployed; curfews; anyone that moves would be shot. Of course now there are some people there that have light arms, like your AKs and whatnot, and when you have people coming into your home to do you harm, you get to the point where you do use these weapons, and so now they're like, "Oh, terrorists are there," so they start droning the place; air strikes happening. It's all a shenanigan. It's a big attempt to continue the narrative and to say that, you know, they are actually advancing, or doing something, or meeting their targets or their objectives.
<br>
<br>Kim: Do you think this has anything to do with the Greater Israel Project?
<br>
<br>00:38:42
<br>
<br>Agent M: I think it does, and I believe that they're doing it slowly. I mean, everything that you call the Arab Spring that started in 2011 is part, and even the emergence of ISIS and all of that is part, a big part of the Greater Israeli Plan, yes. But the recent events are just to clear up for the lack of execution on the Iranian side to start this world war. So they needed a boogeyman, and they couldn't find anyone except for a bunch of Palestinian kids in the West Bank.
<br>
<br>Kim: Yeah. I've seen some of the social media coming out of there. There's like a little three-year-old in one of the pictures I saw, and it says, "You whore," and all of this stuff. I mean, it's a baby; it's a three-year-old child. It's ridiculous. And it almost seems like they're trying to entice them into doing something. I think when this all started, though, they did have the backing of the Pallavicinis. It looked like Hamas did.
<br>
<br>Agent M: Well, everybody did. You have the Syrians; Assad and his wife were having talks and being promised by them. The Iranians. That's part of the fake deaths and relocations to Belize. You know, Assad and his wife are not in Syria, and he is in Moscow and she is in London. I don't know if she joined him. I think there's a lot of people that are being pissed off. And it seems like everybody's getting on everybody's throat. And the Pallavicinis are not really doing anything except making promises of payment next day or next Friday.
<br>
<br>00:41:02
<br>
<br>Kim: Yeah. And so what we're starting to see is like this ebb and this flow. You know, first we're seeing a lot of social media talk plus mainstream media talk with Iran. We're seeing them over the last several months allegedly threatening Israel, posting pictures of large rockets and new potential nuclear weapons, and these types of things saying, "Any day now, we're going to strike you." I think the latest is today or tomorrow. Is that right?
<br>
<br>Agent M: Yeah.
<br>
<br>Kim: Yeah. But of course, it's payday today. So they probably, since nothing happened and nobody got any money, are trying to do that. Another interesting development I'm going to talk about too, regarding the Middle East, is something that kind of came to my attention recently. So I'm going to mention it to you, because it's important as an American citizen that you know this, and it's also important for the Middle East.
<br>
<br>00:42:08
<br>
<br>So there it has been for a long, long time the usage of Super Note Cash. We've talked about it several times on the news. Meaning they pay people with these pallets of cash, and then decades go by and they're still not able to put them into the banking system. Now there's a few interesting things going on behind the scenes. Now, interesting enough, AgentM, you mentioned that they have something like AKs. And for those of you that don't know, that's a Kalashnikov. That's a Russian weapon. So I don't know if there's any correlation here, but there's been a lot of chatter about BRICS being able to launch their own currency again. There's an uptick in this, and I'm mentioning it for a reason.
<br>
<br>00:43:07
<br>
<br>It appears that they have been promised by these Deep State operatives that they will allow them to have their own currency, but of course they need to be in control of it. They are also basically saying that they would allow BRICS to issue this new currency not only if they were in control of it but also if they would assist them with the crash of the United States dollar. And they would replace the United States dollar as the world's currency after its fall, of course, with the BRICS currency. Now, these same operators are people that I watch very closely. And I watch them very closely because they're always doing something they think is going to work, but it doesn't ever work.
<br>
<br>00:44:10
<br>
<br>Now, for those of you that don't know, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, I do know Israel as well, Iran, for sure - the Revolutionary Guard there - and Iraq have been waiting to cash in some of these pallets of cash for over three decades, some of them even longer. Saudi Arabia got the majority of their pallets back during Desert Storm. You probably remember that. I know that some of the pallets of cash were actually sent to the tune of about $3 billion in pallets of cash were actually sent by Kamala, just as she came into office as Vice President of the United States. She was the one that ordered those pallets to be transferred to Iran, actually. There are rumors that there are a lot of pallets of cash also in the UAE, United Arab Emirates, and also in Dubai. And, of course, always we can never forget Turkey because they have lots of them as well. Now worldwide, we estimate these pallets of cash - they're super notes - to be somewhere around $27 trillion; I think that's up to almost $38 trillion now because Blackwater has figured out a way to start printing them.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Wow.
<br>
<br>00:45:43
<br>
<br>Kim: Yep, that's a lot of cash. Even if they cashed it all in and it all went into the banking system, it's still - well that's never going to happen anyway - it's still not enough for them to dominate any kind of financial markets or anything. And would it be enough to pay for a world war for a little while? Yeah, it probably would be. But that's never going to happen either, and I need to explain that. So, it has come to my attention that the same people that are running this crazy operation of "crash the dollar, promise BRICS countries" - most specifically China and of course, Russia - that they would have their own currency, which is a lie, that their goal and the way that they plan on crashing the dollar; which would make sense to the Russians because - I keep repeating the Russians because I know about/I actually listen to the lengthy conversations that have been taking place both in person and also over the phone with Duck Dynasty. So I'm paying attention here. So Duck Dynasty is so old; they were operatives that were actually present during the fall of the Soviet Union back in the day. They talk about it a lot, these guys, both in alt-media circles, and they discuss it a lot, about what they did. They keep saying they actually did it.
<br>
<br>00:47:15
<br>
<br>But what they forget is number 1. You had a significant group of alien overlords that did it. Okay, that's number 1. Meaning the crash of the ruble did not happen because you guys put a bunch of ruble on some pallets, took it out of the country, and then came back in and flooded the market. Next, we did not have, at that time, a human computer network that was global, meaning we did not have a financial system that was interconnected globally in those days. It really didn't start ramping up until 1984, and then, I'd say probably about the late 80s, mid 80s, is when pretty much the whole world was on this global financial system.
<br>
<br>00:48:10
<br>
<br>But what you did have at that point was that you actually had a backbone Omega system that was in agreement with what the aliens wanted. Now just because you're the cowboy-boot-wearing asshole that showed up over there in the 1979 or 89, whether that be Iran or Russia, and moved money all around, and you think that you were the one that crashed it? No, you didn't. No, that didn't happen. No. You just did your little tiny part, and you think you were successful, just like Leo Wanta and others that talk about being the ones. There's been so many ones that have crashed the Soviet Union, allegedly. But, on the Russian side of it, it kind of made sense. Well, this was something the Russians and the Iranians were trying to do cooperatively in 1979.
<br>
<br>00:49:03
<br>
<br>So, for those of you listening, welcome back to 1979. Here we are again. We're running the same operations that we ran then, or they are, I should say, not us. So they intend to take this, approximately from what I can tell, about $38 trillion in fake United States dollars, and they think that they could flood the market with them, number 1. Number 2, blame it on China. It's already started. You're going to blame it on China. Number 3, that means they get their world war. And Number 4, they think that'll give them access to a system that really doesn't exist anymore called Omega. And number 5, I don't know if they're trying to beat it into submission. I don't know if they're trying to beat it into submission...
<br>
<br>Sunny: They're trying to will it to happen, I feel.
<br>
<br>00:49:54
<br>
<br>Kim: They're trying to will it to happen. Look at all the humans that want this to happen. And then we're going to go into the Savior Complex about this too, because you actually do play a big part in a lot of what's going on. So I think the reason why we're seeing a lot of steady movement in the Middle East but not a complete eruption is because everybody is being promised now that they can cash in these pallets of cash. For those of you that don't know, the central bank digital currency known as USTC is also being given in fake wallets. I think, Agent M, you even got some at one point, didn't you?
<br>
<br>00:50:36
<br>
<br>Agent M: I had, I received from someone else something similar, which was, I think, the earlier version of this, the XUSDP or something like that.
<br>
<br>Kim: Yeah. Insert digital currency here, and of course they wanted him to do a bunch of things, and he's like, well, I can't spend this money, and there was this whole argument. So of course, they were going to round back to him when that was cashable. And now we've got a new one, USTC, U.S. Treasury Coin, which is not involving the Fed, by the way. But it is involving the Treasury Department, which has always been a Black Sun operation. So they are also holding these large wallets that they've been promised they could cash that in very soon.
<br>
<br>00:51:28
<br>
<br>The other thing that all these countries have in common is that most all of them now hold the BRICS digital currency in fake wallets, which is fake money, which they can't actually use. So, there's a lot of chatter going on right now about the United States supporting BRICS as the global currency of the world, the global world's trade currency. So in other words, all gold, all oil, and all gas would all be traded in BRICS global currency at that point. Now, see, these are Americans, most of them, And they're more than happy to crash the United States as long as they get some power. I think they've been wearing their cowboy hat too tight and their boots too small, because this is never going to happen the way they plan it.
<br>
<br>00:52:23
<br>
<br>So they want to take this cash; they think they can flood the market in 2024 and end up with the same results that they had in the USSR, which meant a crash of the economy. Then they come in, and then they'll make their deals with the United States. Of course, they're going to be the savior now, them and the Orange People, not the Oompa Loompas guys. I have nothing against Oompa Loompas. I'm talking about the taller Orange People. They're going to come in, and they're going to be the savior of the United States. You know, gonna negotiate with China, just like they negotiated with the U.S. on behalf of the USSR states in Russia, et cetera, at the time.
<br>
<br>But you have a little flawed model here there, gentlemen. Number 1, you do not control human computer networks. Number 2, that is not in Omega's former programming, even if you could get it up and running again. Next, you're going to run into the Key Integrated Monetary System, which will kick out your $38 trillion in fake money. We are also digitized now. We have point-of-sale machines, tap and pay. We have counters that actually will register the magnetic ink, whether it's true or false. And you'd still have to put those numbers on a computer screen in order to affect the value of the dollar. Again, it's not 1984. I know that you want it to be 1984. I'm sure you want to be a young spunky cowboy operative out there, but unfortunately, that's not going to work out for you.
<br>
<br>00:53:54
<br>
<br>Next, all the deals that you're making with all these people in the Middle East, that they're going to finally, finally, finally be able to cash in their U.S. Treasury Coin, your BRICS Coin, your pallets of cash, the ones that I know are calling you and promising you all of this are full of "it." Beep. You know? They are full of it. There is no way that they could achieve this objective without the cooperation of the base platform for human computer networks on Earth. There's no way.
<br>
<br>So they see these little uprisings down Monday, Wednesday; Monday, Friday; whatever it is; next full moon; new moon; harvest moon, everybody's getting paid - 9/9, that's another day - and nothing is going to happen. You countries are all going to be sitting there looking just like you are right now, with your jaw on the floor, basically saying, "Where's our money?" China is not going to take the blame and start World War III, like they are saying, for the American operatives that are working for the Trump administration's ridiculous monetary scheme from 1984, which will not work today.
<br>
<br>00:55:18
<br>
<br>It will not work today. They're going to be very disappointed people every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday forever. But the problem that I have and the reason why Agent M is here - he's telling you about what's really happening. So when they do this little fake out and they get people over there all excited, and then they start killing their own, this is a very real situation for these people. They're shooting down drones that have been flying over Iraq - they're desperately trying to get the country of Iraq involved right now - but at the base root of it all, it has to do with a bunch of fake super notes, an operation that they did not run in the 1980s. You did not run that operation. I will repeat, I know operatives, you think that you ran this operation; you did not run it.
<br>
<br>00:56:20
<br>
<br>And in combination with that, in order to sign up all of these countries behind the scenes, like Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and all of these countries that have agreed to join the BRICS organization, they're all sitting there looking at their wallets because they're being told that they're going to be cashable now. Forget your U.S. Treasury; we'll exchange you your fake U.S. Treasury Coin, XUSD, or whatever it is these days, and we're going to put in Bricks Coin in there for you. See? We're going to exchange that out. Look, you exchanged. And those pallets of cash, we'll take care of those too. Don't worry. We're going to get those in the banking system. We're going to flood the banking system. We're going to crash the dollar. We know how much you hate the United States. We even quit working for the United States, even though they are Trump, basically. And we're going to go work for China now, just like Blackwater/Academy/Frontier, whatever you call it, did. So we're going to support them in what they're doing.
<br>
<br>00:57:30
<br>
<br>The Russians, well, they're just going to get scr - I almost said that. They're just going to get, how do I say this? Let's just say be disappointed. They're going to be disappointed. There I recovered nicely, didn't I? They're going to be highly disappointed when this doesn't work out, but they have been providing arms, as we know, to Iran. They've been providing arms to some northern African countries as well, and they've also been providing arms to apparently the Hamas. Probably because the Pallavicini family is in tight with the family - obviously the Greek family - that is also a part of the Black Nobility.
<br>
<br>00:58:18
<br>
<br>Now I have heard a rumor, but I have not been able to confirm it because it had nothing to do with me at this moment, so I need to actually confirm this rumor, that the person who has taken the position of Falcon: now Falcon is a position in the Order of the Black Sun; this would be second in command to the Black Eagle. I don't know; they like birds over there. But anyway, it would be second in command to the Black Eagle. But I heard that this person departed the planet last night. So I have not confirmed that yet. I probably could try to confirm it over the weekend. I've kind of been focused on some other things, but yeah.
<br>
<br>00:59:15
<br>
<br>So, we talk a lot here about savior complexes, savior syndromes, all of this type of stuff. And I guess it's no different for countries. You know, we say, "If it's going to be, it's up to me." These people say, "If it's going to be, it's up to us." Even though we keep pointing out that all they do is lie. They try to use Tom, use me to say that that's where the money is coming from. That didn't work out real well, and so now they're back to the pallets of cash. It's actually called here amongst U.S. operatives; it's called Project Becky is what it's called. I don't know who Rebecca was or Becky is, but that's what they named it: Project Becky. So they've been trying to cash these pallets. They've been floating around the operative world with big promises and zero delivery, as far as I know, for, oh, let's see, one, two, three, four decades? Four or five decades? Yeah. And nobody's actually been able to cash them in.
<br>
<br>01:00:28
<br>
<br>Actually, at that time when this all started, it was Bush Senior that created this "how to get everybody to do something for nothing" scam, how to move the world for nothing. But at that time, operatives were actually still getting paid money too, because they had access to some accounts that were based out of Credit Suisse but trickled into places like the Cayman Islands and Panama and other places where operatives would get paid. So at this moment in time, that is never going to happen. So if you happen to be listening to this from Iran, Iraq, Israel, or anywhere else, they do not have the power to put those dollars into circulation. Yeah, you might find some people trying to buy gas at a gas station or petrol station here in the U.S. or whatever with it. It doesn't even matter if you try to circulate those dollars all over the world. It doesn't even matter if you made deals with banks to take them in, because the actual Office of Accounting is not going to count them as a viable dollar. It will count them as counterfeit, actually, and then kick it out of the banking system completely.
<br>
<br>01:01:45
<br>
<br>So they keep trying to do something that's old and make it new, but what it does is it kills people. You know? And that's my concern. My biggest concern right now is that their lies kill people. I don't know if they breed or what they do, but like, you get rid of a hundred of them, and then there's a hundred more. I mean, I have been to so many sites on this planet where they have been trying to get ahold of systems, trying to do things that are going to blow people up. I was in the Maldives this morning. I was also off the coast of Greenland this morning as well. And they just never get anywhere. But I guess they have faith, and they're not going to give up. But the savior complex of countries, like the Russians and the Chinese, are they ever going to get over the fact that The Order is never going to come through for them? Are they?
<br>
<br>Sunny: It doesn't seem like it.
<br>
<br>01:02:52
<br>
<br>Kim: That's number 1. Number 2, You know what? If the Russian government wasn't in on this, the USSR government at the time, the old KGB used to run it; the KGB is still running it; that's Putin, whatever that is these days, still running the Russian government. It says nothing's changed. Nothing's changed whatsoever. The only difference is they're all sitting there waiting for their partners in crime there, the Cowboy people, to finish the job.
<br>
<br>That's why I'm encouraging all of you to start to think. Think about something different. Think about something new. What can we do to fix this society the way that it is? How do you not become the old KGB? Start your war again, keep things back up in Ukraine, and keep it pumping on behalf of some cowboys that think it's 1984. I'm under no delusion it's 2024. You know, I don't know about you guys, but it's definitely 2024, at least in our current calendar. I don't know how many trips around the sun that really means and four calendars ago and whatever the SSP thinks, but that will never; that dog is never going to hunt. So I'm sorry Operative people; I'm sorry AK-47 people and Kalashnikov people, but you're never going to get paid. It's never going to happen.
<br>
<br>01:04:18
<br>
<br>The Pallivicinis are not going to be able to come through. As a matter of fact, one of their top folks, as far as I know, is gone from this planet as of last night. I don't know who actually did it - it wasn't me. They are not making arrests on behalf of the White Hats or anything else in the United States. They're actually working together right now with the BRICS countries and China to burn the United States to the ground. So as they make deals with politicians and all kinds of things - I mean, I haven't really heard them mention to any of those politicians or their operatives because it's operative-to-operative talking there. That actually alludes to what they're really doing. So they're just lying to everybody. According to the military, that's supposed to be a U.S. military that's supposed to be allegedly protecting us. When they were questioned about what's going on and what was the deal with the ground offensive of IDF/Israeli Defense Forces, well, they said, "Well, those Trump people kind of run their own show."
<br>
<br>Sunny: That's what the U.S. military said?
<br>
<br>Kim: Yeah.
<br>
<br>Sunny: And that's okay?
<br>
<br>01:05:35
<br>
<br>Kim: Well, like I said, I told you I don't expect them to do anything. I really don't. There's no tribunals going on. There's no Gitmo project. There is none of that happening from our own U.S. military. And okay, fine, they're doing their own thing in the Middle East. That means that the Trump operatives are using all of their contacts and connections from 1980, whoever is still alive over there, and they're still trying to run things in the Middle East, and that's fine. Obviously, no offense guys, but you probably should think about maybe taking a job as a Walmart greeter, maybe an action hero in a movie. Maybe it could be you could be that you know, but your baloney doesn't work over here. So we run counter to you guys all the time, and it takes like 5-10 minutes, and we're like, doop, done. But as far as this is concerned, it's just another day ending in Y with the same operations you think you ran in 1984, which you didn't run, that you intend to run again.
<br>
<br>01:06:50
<br>
<br>So here we go. Do I see them crashing the United States dollar? No. No. Do I see them making promises that they're going to crash the U.S. dollar? Yes. Do I see the United States military that's supposed to be protecting the United States? Like, that's kind of technically their job. Doing anything about it? Nope. Nope. Even if they thought it was possible, they'd be like, "Oh, well, that's cool. How much are we getting? Oh, we're gonna get big money from it. Oh, okay. You can go ahead and just burn the place to the ground. That's totally fine. We'll help you, actually. Would you like us to arm some citizens, maybe get the Civil War going?"
<br>
<br>Sunny: Yeah.
<br>
<br>Kim: And it's no different over there in the Middle East.
<br>
<br>01:07:37
<br>
<br>Agent M: Yeah, it seems like we have a saying here. It says that the donkey doesn't fall in the same hole twice. Which means a donkey is intelligent enough not to fall in the same hole again. Apparently our Deep State operatives are not even intelligent enough to be donkeys.
<br>
<br>Kim: Nope. They keep going in the same holes. You know, they've got their select group of 15 holes or 20 holes, and it's the same thing over and over and over again, constantly over and over and over again, which is why I keep saying to you guys, we've got to do it better. We've got to do it different. We need to make sure we have our own resources in every respect. And for the love of God, please do not expect the military to save you. Because they're not going to. It's never going to happen. They're complicit in half of the operations that are intended to burn this country to the ground.
<br>
<br>Sunny: It's really the leadership though, right, Kim? Because there's a lot of people in the military that really do think that they're serving their country and doing a good thing.
<br>
<br>01:08:51
<br>
<br>Kim: I know they do. And a lot of them even know what's going on - more than they're willing to say. Because when you're in there, you can't say anything, right? You have to go. Even if they know they're going into the slaughter and the orders don't make any sense, they still will go anyway because that's being told to, and that's how rank and file works. And for them, your father served, your mother may have served, something like that; they go into the military, and they don't want to dishonor their parents by not following orders and not being a good little soldier and that kind of thing.
<br>
<br>But I would caution you to ever be joining the military in any country, anywhere at this moment in time. I'm sure it's excellent training; the benefits are excellent. But it isn't your daddy's military anymore. It's worse than it's ever been. Ever been. You know? It's just not worth it. Why would you do it? If anything, maybe take some training courses, figure out how to shoot some guns, and be prepared to defend your neighborhood should anything happen. Protect your own.
<br>
<br>01:10:06
<br>
<br>They give them guns so they can protect themselves, and then they call them terrorists. It's a setup. Oh look, it's a Kalashnikov. Hey, anybody watch the movie "American Made?" Anybody see that movie? What a coincidence! They were shoving Kalashnikovs down the throats of the people in Panama. Just down their throats. They wanted to make sure they were running around with Russian weapons so that they could blame Russia for what was happening there. Russia supplied the weapons, but it wasn't. It was the CIA in the movie, and it's the CIA now who is really providing Kalashnikovs to the people in the strip. But if you're standing there with your wife and your kids, or your kids and whatever, you're going to defend your kids. And you've now got a weapon to hopefully defend yourself somewhat so that you can make it to the corner store to get a gallon of milk.
<br>
<br>01:11:03
<br>
<br>You know, they're forcing them into creating a world war-type situation. While the very Americans that get on YouTube and every other tube and start sitting there saying they're patriots are the ones that are giving them the Kalashnikovs. You know this is old news. It's not 1984. You've never had anybody run counter you. Everybody that was in my position and higher on this planet before was the one that gave you the orders to do it in the first place. One out of 9000 operations it took running simultaneously, and you only knew about two, to allegedly the USSR. In the days of the USSR, back when they had an Omega system and there was a Marduk and Enki and an Enlil and The Parents and Covens and all these people that were participating in the alleged fall of the USSR as it was supposed to be at that time, they also granted Gorbachev a high-ranking position in The Order. And he still has that high-ranking position in The Order. They also transferred 11 trillion United States dollars to a bank in a little tiny country called Andorra for him to use personally. That was his personal money.
<br>Sunny: Wow.
<br>
<br>01:12:45
<br>
<br>Kim: Yep. And that's how it used to work. And that's why the Cowboys were successful. I mean, realistically, if you walked into any country in the world, anywhere, and offered someone $11 trillion to let your country fall apart, do you know how many of those leaders would say no?
<br>
<br>Sunny: Yeah, that's scary.
<br>
<br>Kim: Not one of them would say no. So it's not like the Cowboys are that talented or anything. That's an idiot's dream. I mean, like me walking into a homeless shelter and saying, "Hey, I've got keys to this house. I'm ready to give them to one of you; who wants to do this?" It doesn't matter what it is, you know. It doesn't matter. I need you to drive this car through here or do this, or they'd all do it. You know, and then they'd probably have all the rest of the people in the shelter living in it too, because that's how those people are. But I'm not saying the leaders do that - no one shared Gorbachev's $11 trillion, and nobody even cared until it went and got frozen several years ago, back in 2007, 2008. But that's a couple decades of living high on the hog. You'd think he would have gotten that thing off his head too, you know? Maybe that's a signature thing; I don't know.
<br>
<br>01:14:13
<br>
<br>But anyway, the point is, what they're trying to do is not going to be successful. You know, you're going to hurt some people, yes. We can't get rid of you fast enough. You're like cockroaches. We have come to the conclusion you are now pretty much enemy number 1 on this planet. That's kind of sad. I'm going to start putting posters up through the Gaza Strip. Have you seen Mo, Larry, or Curly? You know, call us. Call this number.
<br>
<br>Agent M, more importantly, some other questions for you. So let's just say we can get the Duck Dynasty to stop disrupting life in the Middle East. Let's just say that they abandon the Israeli Project. Let's just say the Greater Israel Project, where Israel becomes the entire Middle East. That's their goal there. Let's just say all that's abandoned. What do you feel is going to be some of the greatest challenges with life in the region there that we're going to face?
<br>
<br>01:15:31
<br>
<br>Agent M: Well, me personally, I believe that when there's a vacuum of power, someone or something else arises to fill that gap. And you have some power hungry people that either were born privileged or just trying to climb the ladder. And people might think this is outrageous, but I believe the first threat to the people if all of these, Israel and everything tied to it was gone. The religious people on all sides are going to be a hurdle. Each one is going to entice his group or his people and try to wage war against the others, even if unprompted - it's just power and money. So whether it's a Sunni or Shia they all get contributions and donations just like people and then churches across the world for example do.
<br>
<br>01:16:58
<br>
<br>And maybe the churches don't donate that much, but, for example, the Shia people donate 20 percent of their annual income to people like Sistani and others. So I believe that these are going to be - people need to be educated that these people are not of the Light, and that they don't have their best interests at heart, and they need to be, if needed, exposed. And people need to be shone the light, basically. Other than that, you will have security issues. The region is primarily tribal, and there have been, due to situations that the Middle East has been through for the past at least 100 years, if not more, you have a lot of vengeance and things like that and hatred between this city and that city or this tribe and that tribe or this family and that family, and this carries on generation after generation in some cases.
<br>
<br>01:18:13
<br>
<br>So these need to be resolved. There has to be some form of an honor code or something that everybody signs on that starts for a new beginning and forgives the past, forgives each other, forgives themselves, and looks into the future. Then you would have things like food security and infrastructure. At the moment, if you look at the Middle East, Egypt is now having blackouts and brownouts, for I don't know what reason. This is manufactured because they do have the fuel, and they have actually doubled the capacity of their production or what they need. So that is manufactured.
<br>
<br>But like in places like Lebanon, Lebanon currently is producing the power grid; there is producing 0. Everything in the country is being run on, like private small generators and off-market fuel. The country itself does not have fuel anymore and has no money to actually import any. Iraq was funding them or giving them free, well, not to the people. Iraq was donating fuel, buying it from Iran for twice the price, if not three times the price, and donating it to Hezbollah so Hezbollah can sell it on the black market in Lebanon to the Lebanese people.
<br>
<br>01:19:57
<br>
<br>So that is one. Syria is having, like in the best places, in Damascus, the capital, they're having one hour a day of electricity. One hour. And if you go to Iraq, Iraq is at best giving six hours a day. And the rest is that people are relying either on generators or they're staying in the dark. So these are things that need immediate attention afterwards, and people need to rise to the occasion. People need to come together. The leaders, the ones that are instinctive leaders, the alpha males and females, now it's their time to shine. Now it's their time to step up because if they're going to stay in hiding and if they're going to keep the status quo, the bad people are going to still be there, and if not, more bad people will be created because they see opportunity. So these are some of the things I see that need attention in that scenario.
<br>
<br>01:21:17
<br>
<br>Kim: Well, yeah, and we're not even just talking about war-torn areas, either. We're talking about cities where there really wasn't any kind of war happening, at least not in a few decades. You know, they don't have full power either, right?
<br>
<br>Agent M: That is true, yeah.
<br>
<br>Kim: And remember, Agent M. and I were having this conversation about something that was going on one day, and he's like, "Well, I just got back, and I really need to go take a shower or whatever." And he was mentioning to me that they have cisterns that collect rainwater on the roof because they claim that there's a drought, even though at the same time there's a drought, there's also a flood happening. The dams are overflowing, actually, like within a week of us having this conversation. They're collecting rainwater to have running water all the time because the water isn't on all the time.
<br>
<br>01:22:26
<br>
<br>Agent M: That is true. A lot of the cities in the Middle East lack water. For example, Damascus does not have any rivers or sea or salination plants near them. They rely on one major well, and that well is very close to the Moses Caves, or Caves of Moses.
<br>
<br>Kim: The Dial of Destiny location.
<br>
<br>Agent M: The Dial of Destiny location. I have personally been there, and it's one of the best-tasting waters you can taste. Very clean. But that's still, I mean, a big city like that is relying on one well, right? Now you have places like, there are other places like across Jordan, or Jordan has no rivers or seas, and that's so, I mean, they do have a sea, the access to the Red Sea, but still there is a lack of water.
<br>
<br>So Iraq has two rivers, but because the government has been so corrupt, they've been just focused on creating fake projects so they can steal that money and pocket it and spend it on primarily escorts. Sad to say.ose to the Moses Caves or Caves of Moses.
<br>
<br>Now you have places like, there are other places like across Jordan, or Jordan has no rivers or seas, and that's so, I mean, they do have a sea, the access to the Red Sea, but still there is a lack of water.
<br>
<br>01:23:58
<br>
<br>Kim: And snow. A lot of snow.
<br>
<br>Agent M: Yeah, exactly.
<br>
<br>Kim: And Viagra.
<br>
<br>Agent M: Yeah, so these are things that need to be changed. The flow of rain that happened in the past year could sustain the whole region for 10 years. But there was no infrastructure set. All of it went away. In fact, it did a lot of damage to villages and people that live near the dams and near the rivers, more than it did them good. It destroyed their crops as well. So these things need to be addressed and need to be done. And I don't think - they're all interconnected - you cannot do them one isolated from the other. They all have to be under one master plan for the whole region to connect everything and everyone. Because, whether we like it or not, these borders were set up under 100 years ago. These people used to be, the people in the Middle East used to travel all across the entire place with no passports or no IDs, and you had relatives in different, what we call now, countries. I think the people are starving to get back to that point.
<br>
<br>01:25:36
<br>
<br>Kim: Well, change is never easy, but we've only been desalinating water now for probably at least a century, if not more, longer than a century. They could have put infrastructure there long before there were ever wars and Desert Storm, long before. They had made ridiculous sums of money in oil since we've had cars. They've been around for a while; we've had cars. They could have put up desalination plants, large plants. They could have put in infrastructure. And he's right. In a lot of cases, the soil there is very hard because it's the same thing kind of like it is if you're in the U.S., like it is in Arizona or other deserts you might be familiar with. It gets really, really hard, and then it forms something called caliche; at least that's what we call it here in the U.S., where it's like cement, about six feet down.
<br>
<br>But you don't need to go down that far to build the infrastructure. Matter of fact, that's the whole reason why they killed Gandhi [Ghaddafi] over in Libya is because he was building water waste for 30 years. So I'm not saying he's a good guy or a bad guy or anything like anything else, but they definitely didn't want water in the Middle East. So as far as I'm concerned, the faster these cowboys get out of our way, the better off we'll be. You know, we don't have the Clintons sending Navy SEALs over there to die at the moment. You know, it looks like they would like to send some people over there to die.
<br>
<br>01:27:36
<br>
<br>So it's... Don't take people's words for it, let's put it that way. When people are telling you that they're saving this and saving babies and saving these things and all that - they are not saving anyone. Sorry. There might be a few military people running around in Israel, slash Gaza, the West Bank area right now that have saved some kids, animals, things like that. But for the most part, as far as orders, they're not ordered to do any of that. There's nobody high up in the military. There's no White Hats. I'm sorry, but we're on our own, kids. We are on our own. The more we try to figure out, the more we talk to Agent M., the more we talk about these types of things. The more we can understand our infrastructure in America is falling apart. Europe's is better than ours, believe it or not. And you know, there it's semi-nonexistent as far as what we know.
<br>
<br>01:28:45
<br>
<br>We got a long road ahead of us. Are they going to blow it up with drones? Well, I don't know. It's something we have to think about. We have to think about how to protect those ocean pipelines that will go to desalination plants in major cities so we can bring water in. There's no shortage. The electricity isn't going out anymore. You know, six hours a day of electricity, for you Americans watching this, it is probably about 100 to 120 degrees there where they have no electricity. You can't even run a fan, unless you're special and you have a generator, and most people can't afford those things either. So you've got to really start thinking about infrastructure projects, and without being in this location, you wouldn't understand why, gee, we can give them all this juice or that juice. It's like they don't even have any power on to run a juice or juice the thing you're telling them to juice. You know what I mean? It's not funny. It's just a reality of it.
<br>
<br>01:30:00
<br>
<br>Then of course, do you know anything about all these tribes? Who are these people? What are their regions? Where are they? Who's going to fight who if we decide we're going to put a desalination plant here? You've got to have somebody that understands the area and their region. You will never be successful in giving people project advice that are not in the location where they intend to build the project. And Americans, I love you all dearly, I'm an American as well, but please stop trying to save starving children in Africa. They need to save themselves. No offense, but they do. That means they need to come up with their own ways of transporting food, their own places where they can grow food, and they need to figure it out. And they have done it for centuries since others invaded the lands, so to speak. They have been feeding themselves. The United Nations doesn't drop off that much food, guys. They really don't. Maybe there's some cool stuff that they get, cookies or whatever that gets imported from Europe. But for the most part, they're ready to do it, and they're ready to do it themselves. They don't need your help. No offense, guys.
<br>
<br>01:31:13
<br>
<br>Focus on the children that are starving down the street from you, because I guarantee you there are. You know, we paint this picture to the rest of the Western world and on television like this is the greatest country. It hasn't been the greatest country for a long, long time. You can thank our Cowboys for that. And they'd like to burn it further to the ground. So that's something we need to be concerned about too, because we now know what they would like to do. They have sold out to China. I think they want to be China operatives. I don't know if that's, they would like to do that over there. China is also lying to them to be fair. And everybody's lying to the Russians - both the Chinese and the...
<br>
<br>Sunny: What a mess.
<br>
<br>01:32:00
<br>
<br>Kim [laughing]: Oh boy! But the world needs to change, and it's going to change because we're changing it. It's not because somebody's coming to save us. It's not because the military is going to do something for us. And I'm sorry, and it's a hard fact, really. And there have been times in my life where the only thing there was Source; that's it. And I thought to myself, "How am I going to do this by myself? How, How? That's not even possible." But you know what? Things are possible that you never even dreamt of. You know, when you're, I mean, you'd be surprised; things just show right up on your doorstep. You know, you come up with a great idea: how you can negotiate with all these tribes to get everybody to at least agree that you all need electricity and water and what their share in that might be if it's a monetary thing. And I know you don't like these people, and that's fine. You don't have to like these people, but you need to send the water through. You know? I mean, and how do we make those negotiations? And someone that has been there knows those people, like Agent M., will help us get that job done.
<br>
<br>01:33:16
<br>
<br>You know, we may need lots of things from you guys, too. I know the medical system there is terrible as well. I mean, they don't have; you don't make a doctor's appointment there. You'll sit there all day long, and you might not get to see the doctor for three days. You have to come back in the morning and wait in line again. So you know, I know everybody thinks that the U.S. is burning, and I've received some messages saying, "Oh, I had to walk; my car is broken." You know, try being Agent M over here.
<br>
<br>Agent M: That's not a good idea.
<br>
<br>Kim: Well, that's what I'm trying to say. You know, count your blessings. He's still walking. He's breathing, after a whole month of barely making it. You know, we have a lot of work to do, and we have to look at ourselves too and say, what are we willing to do?
<br>
<br>01:34:12
<br>
<br>Things that we see as saviors aren't just people either. We can walk down the street to a pharmacy or - we call them drug stores here in America - you can go pick up some aspirin if you have a migraine. You can go make an emergency appointment and get seen the same day. We complain if we have to wait a couple of hours in an emergency room or in urgent care. You don't realize how good you have it and how good the system actually is compared to the way it is in other countries. But we definitely need to take a look at the things that we find convenient and figure out something to replace them, and hopefully something healthier. That works.
<br>
<br>01:35:00
<br>
<br>Long road to go, guys. We've got a lot of work to do, so roll up your sleeves, get to work on your planning of how we're going to do that in your community, in your area, in your country. And try not to focus on the dark parts of things that are trying to happen here and there. I know it's disturbing and it's upsetting, but these people are strong. They've been through this for decades. Most of them don't even know what it's like to live in an area where there is no war and people aren't shooting at each other. And it's not often as bad as it seems on TV either, some of these places.
<br>
<br>Agent M, you remember the time we had that footage of them videotaping them shooting rockets and it really wasn't even happening?
<br>
<br>01:35:57
<br>
<br>Agent M: Oh yeah, I mean they falsify things all the time, especially recently where there isn't like pay or nobody's holding their promises. Okay, I'll give you an example. Recently, this is not in Iraq; this is in Lebanon. Right before that incident with the Israelis going into the West Bank, the Hezbollah launched - I counted them - 40 rockets. And they came out in the media saying they launched 320 rockets. I was like, there were only 40. I counted them from all the footage from all different angles. I saw them, and you know, they allegedly also said that they hit Israeli forces with it; in fact, the only thing that was hit was a chicken farm, and a few chickens were killed and injured; other than that, nothing. And now you can see there's a meme that is going like wildfire in the Middle East where chickens are armed. There are pictures of chickens that are armed to protect themselves.
<br>
<br>01:37:22
<br>
<br>Kim: I can see that. That could be very important. Yeah. They do that a lot. The other thing that we have also heard over the last week is allegedly there had been eight people, according to data, that had passed away of monkeypox in the last 50 years. Now, if we look at the current data that is being reported, over 525 people have died on the African continent. There's hundreds of thousands of people that are infected, and the numbers just went off the charts. I'm like, yeah, no, definitely not. Unless P-O-X stands for some kind of new machine gun or drone. Is it a "P-O-X" drone, Agent M? No? Pakistani... Oh.
<br>
<br>No. Maybe it's like Disease X and Space X and Elon Musk; maybe he's got a "P 0 X" drone. That's yeah.
<br>
<br>01:38:39
<br>
<br>Agent M: I mean, if you list the - since the coronavirus first came out, or at least in the media - if you list all the names of the variations that happened of that and every single disease that came after that, we would reach probably 100 now. And monkey pox is probably not going to be the last; I don't know what poxes they're going to come up with later, but it's not going to work. You know, they don't have, yeah, they don't have the means to spread them, and they don't have the means to bribe and pay the governments to actually implement lockdowns and other things. And because they have not paid up on their last COVID bonds and other things.
<br>
<br>Kim: Nope.
<br>
<br>01:39:31
<br>
<br>Agent M: So I don't think they're gonna, unless they're going to decide to be that specific type of donkey. I don't think they're gonna fall for it again, at least not that way.
<br>
<br>Kim: I don't know. Don't insult donkeys. They're nice.
<br>
<br>Agent M: I know.
<br>
<br>Kim: They have fallen in many - unlike the donkeys - they have gone into the same hole many, many times and tried to jam that square peg right into the round hole over and over, with no results. So we'll see what happens over the weekend. You know, God willing, we'll start to see some change. I know we've been working on change over here. We had some wonderful conversations last night with some different inventors of different products. There is actually a home device now that you can remineralize your water and create a charged water, like a plasma-charged water. For your entire house, it's like 500 United States dollars. I was like, "Oh my gosh, I need that!" So we're taking a collection. No, I'm just kidding. I'm not doing that.
<br>
<br>01:40:43
<br>
<br>But what I'm saying is that people are coming out with so many amazing, innovative things, and it's going to be up to the Marketplace to help them. I mean, I didn't even know this. Apparently, there was a, they call it the Tesla, no affiliation with Elon Musk at all. They named it Tesla after Nikolai Tesla, because I guess they were having - and it was just like a week or two ago - and it was about three hours from here in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where there was this whole big trade show that was going on with hundreds of new technologies that these people have up and running currently. Different frequency machine healers, all kinds of different stuff. And I'm like, "How did I miss that?" Well, I missed it because they don't have any marketing. Unless you know, like you're in the know, you don't even know that it's there. So we're going to start working on hopefully with some of these folks to get the word out when they have these types of shows. We're definitely going to be talking to some of the inventors of those more inventors, I should say, of these new technologies that are already in production and that are already available. So we're excited about that kind of stuff.
<br>
<br>Nobody did bring a transformer for you, Agent M, so I'm sorry about that.
<br>
<br>Agent M: That's okay. We'll look forward.
<br>
<br>01:42:12
<br>
<br>Kim: But we have a way to clean water, so that's good. But anyway, we're going forward with Marketplace. We're going forward with all of those types of ideas, oils; we're going to start doing a lot more of an explanation of what they are, why they work, those kinds of things, and what you could look at for something for yourself if that's what you want to do. We're going to also bring in some other people that have worked with oils as well and actually make their own. That kind of thing too, and get their expertise in their suggestions, because we're doing this not for our own selves; we're doing it for you and for everyone. So the more people that work together, the better off we're going to be. So it'll be great, I think, to have a couple of different experts on to talk about different things. There are some medical devices that are affordable and that you can use at home for pain. They use frequency sound and a certain amount of light, I should say.
<br>
<br>01:43:35
<br>
<br>So there's a lot of different things that they've taken that are kind of on the market that they have perfected. They've actually, there was one guy that took and put, I think he said, well over 100 human frequencies, beneficial frequencies, into his machine. So when you run the machine on yourself, it can actually make all those changes in your body that are positive for healing many different things. So many great things out there. We have not stopped moving forward. Obviously, there's still operations in progress as far as "no, you're not going to crash the currency. No, you're not going to do this." But you know, we're working hard at progressing. Let's put it that way. Very much so, putting together systems that are going to replace other systems, which everyone is going to have to participate in. And I don't mean like we're forcing you to be slaves. What I mean is that it's going to be all of our jobs to make sure that the system works. There has to be a guy that drives the truck. There's going to be a guy that picks up and unloads the truck. There's going to be a lady that's going to do this. There's going to be a man that's going to do that. So there's no one left behind, and no one's left out. But it took all those people and some aliens to make the crappy system we live in now. It's going to take all of us to get together and make this work.

<br>And really listen to each other too, because a lot of people have great ideas. And maybe your idea is halfway there, but maybe they have something else. And don't go yelling at these people. We're not our enemy. We are not our enemy. There are enemies out there, but we, other people, are not it. And I'm sure everybody would like to be right, you know? But we're going to have to throw that attitude out the window where ideas are supported not because of who the person is, or that they've been doing something for 30 years, because I've been surprised by someone who doesn't even have any experience in something going, "Oh, look!" Outside looking in, here's that solution. It's like, wow, never thought about that, you know. So just remember, we're not each other's enemies, please. Try to move forward in a way - you don't have to like everybody, really. You don't. You don't have to invite them over for barbecues or anything like that. But remember, you have the same mission, and that is to make the world a better place for generations to come, and may it never go back to the way that it is now. Just repeat that in your head every time you want to yell at Mary or Fred or Frank or whoever. Just repeat that over and over again. We are not each other's enemies.
