        <strong>
        <br>George: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Reveal Report. I'm your host, George Iceman, and on a Monday we have a special broadcast today as we talk about the Trump effect. What's the Trump effect? What does that mean? We're going to get into it. We have a very special guest. Before we do, we thank you for joining us. If you're new, welcome to the show. What is the Reveal Report?
        </strong>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:02:40</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Well, a few years back, I decided to do a little show to discuss my experiences in the supernatural, in the paranormal, in the occult. I spent over 13 years studying rituals and magic and a whole bunch of other wild things. I discussed the fringe, the esoteric. And during this period of time, believe it or not, I came to see that government policies, the politicians, and many other forms of power associate themselves in the occult. Believe it or not. You'll have to go back and see some of our shows, but I try to do a deep dive. I try to decode these things - days that they pass bills, why they pass bills, under what stars and moons, the type of rituals they may possibly do, and so on and so forth.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:03:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Guys, truth is stranger than fiction - that's what I can tell you right now. And I appreciate you all being here, especially all the supporters from UNN. I know you guys are looking forward to this topic and my guest. My guest has a vast amount of experience dealing in currency, financing, and investment. A very smart woman, she was involved with major deals before she got the position that she is in today. So she understands things. She understands psychology and dealing with very powerful human beings around the world.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:04:10</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: It is essential that we have someone of her stature and her experience come on board and give us some type of light - describe to us things we don't know about that she can share a little information with. So I'm not gonna waste any more time. I know who you're here to see. Please welcome Miss Kimberly Goguen from the Office of the Guardian. Hey, Kim.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:04:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Hey, George, How are you?
        <br>
        <br>George: Good, thank you for being here today.
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Thanks for having me again. It's always fun to have a chat with you.
        <br>
        <br>George: Thanks. You know, our chats are different. We get into some different things. They're interesting and they're a little bit different than your broadcast that you do on a daily basis or a weekly basis. I know you do three shows a week yourself, correct?
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Yep.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:04:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Excellent. And guys, again, UNN - United Network News - is an amazing platform where you'll see Kim share three times a week some intel, information on what's happening - on all aspects - not just the politics, but in every aspect. And she's doing great things there, so we're glad to have her. Okay Kim, Trump has been elected; he's been put into office. Day one, he passes a whole bunch of bills, and people are now referring to the 'Trump effect.' The Trump effect is in full effect; it's in full swing. A lot of things are happening...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:05:31</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: What's actually happening, George? Tell me. Tell me what's happening.
        <br>
        <br>George: Well, let's start with migration. There's a lot going on with migration. People are upset. You know, we got celebrities crying, Kim.
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Aww.
        <br>
        <br>George: Selena Gomez, she broke down in tears today in the news. She said she wished she could help, but she can't help. Anyways, hell is breaking loose with these people. I'm gonna play a clip, just a clip of what's surfacing in the news in the past couple hours. So take a look and then we'll get your feedback. Here it is.

        <br>[News broadcast, Fox5]
        <br>Natasha Verma: Federal immigration raids starting to take place both in our area and across the country. And tonight a closer look at the total number of arrests and what happens next. Welcome back to the five o'clock news. I'm Natasha Verma.
        <br>
        <br>Steve Lacy: I'm Steve Lacy. ICE says that in just the last 24 hours, they've made more than 500 arrests, and already we're starting to see some of those who've been taken into custody leave the country on military planes. So for a look at what's been going on at the national level, Jessica Formos0 joins us now in studio. So, Jess, what's the latest?
        <br>
        <br>Jessica Formoso: Natasha, Steve, a lot is happening. The Trump administration is saying today that it is expanding the fast-track deportation authority nationwide. This means immigration officers will deport those who are undocumented without appearing before a judge. We have seen the raids already happening across the country. The majority of those who have been detained by ICE, the administration says, are criminals.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:07:01</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: They're criminals.
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Oh, yeah.
        <br>
        <br>George: They're being detained. So let me throw it to you. What are your thoughts? What do you know? What's going on? Is this real? Is this a ruse? Are we getting sucked into something else? Talk to us, Kim.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:07:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Well, I do call the Trump operatives 'Duck Dynasty,' don't I? For a reason. And I'm not to say that - look from my standpoint... My personal view on this situation - I'll give you that real quick - is that America has always been the place where people go. And I'm not saying it's the only place to be, or it's the most amazing country in the world, because that's quickly declining and has been for a number of years, long before Trump was ever president the first time.
        <br>
        <br>As far as these raids are concerned - this is a show. And is it harming a lot of people? Yes. Have a lot of these people been here for a long time? Yes. Is there a purpose behind this other than to show that they're doing something? Yes. Are any of these people harming anyone? No. Are they - most of them - employed, working, just want a better life for their families? You know, I lived in Arizona for a long time, in a border state, and there were a lot of immigrants there. You know, our process to achieve citizenship in the United States is ridiculous, even for native English speakers. It's complicated, it's convoluted, it's expensive - it's very expensive. And for a lot of people, that's just not attainable.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:08:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And you know, they try to go through the process, they try to get their green cards and to work here legally, and they've made it very difficult to do that. So do I find that this is uncouth? What happened to the laws? What happened to, you know, people being deported after they've gone to see a judge? What happened to all of this? But this is atypical [typical] Trump operative moves.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:09:28</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>This is what they do. They do things and then try to figure it out later. Part of this has to do with funding for the border wall - showing that there's a great need for billions of dollars to build a wall and that type of thing. So they are trying to appeal to all of their donors in a lot of ways.
        <br>
        <br>There's a lot of loss of income to - let's just say, for lack of a better term, I would say - mafia organizations, human trafficking organizations, when the borders are open and people are here. They would like to make money on those folks, the young kids - you know how they like that in Washington, D.C. But there is definitely big business, they think, to be had.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:10:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>There was a deal during the last Trump administration between Mike Pence, the Vice President, and the President of Mexico, where he would earn about 10% of all the profits of human trafficking across the border. It was deposited at Santander Bank in Mexico. I had lots of conversations with one of the very high-ranking officers at the Central Bank of Mexico at that time, so I have seen proof of it. I know that that is the case.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:11:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And is that something they're trying to do again? I know that there's a lot of tension right now between the CIA - which is also a part of human trafficking - and the organizations that traffic, what's it called, GS-13 [MS-13] or something? There are different gangs in Mexico. They all kind of report to the Colombian mafia anyway when it's Latin American countries; they're the head of all of the Latino gangs in Mexico and the United States.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:11:48</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>There is a significant loss of income when the borders are more open. So they're trying to show some kind of enforcement, I guess. Are these people feeding off our system? Are they taking away our government funds? We really don't have a lot of government funds. No. If you are not here legally, you can't apply for things like food assistance or anything like that anyway. A lot of them just try to get work where they can get work and live their lives in America versus some areas of Mexico, which are much rougher than they are here. So is this a big show? Yeah, it's definitely a big show.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:12:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And people like the Trump operatives could care less who is harmed in any way - they are all about the money. You become an administration to become a power broker. I learned that during the Obama administration, the Bush administration - senior/junior - it's always about the money and how many contracts you can get by doing what you're doing. This one here just looks like it's a giant show. And you have a lot of Americans that are here legally now, that went through similar processes to some of these people that are being arrested and detained.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:13:18</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And you wonder what they're doing to those people. You know, those camps that were shown on TV as one of the last moves of the Trump administration - do you remember that? The tents and all that kind of stuff? Yeah. Let's just say they do a lot of harmful things to those people sometimes, and in my opinion, this is wrong - this is the wrong way to go about it - but then again, they're so haphazard they don't care who they harm.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:13:52</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Well, again, I find it interesting, and they're using a 'border czar' - that's not really a title per se in the United States - but people are calling him [Tom Homan] the czar. And he looks... I don't know if he's involved in this, but he seems to be taking his job quite seriously. You know, what concerns me, Kim, are those that are criminals - those that hurt individuals and other human beings - I think they should be immediately arrested and deported. Anyone that's going to hurt another human being and use force against their own will should be jailed, imprisoned, and thrown out of the U.S. That's just my opinion. Are there innocent people that are going to be caught up in this? Possibly, yes, I understand that - but you'll have to agree that those who do commit crimes need to get the hell out.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:14:39</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Well, and they do. There is a process for that. It's been in place for a long time. If you are here, even if you're here legally - and you have a green card and the whole thing - and you end up committing a federal offense, you go to prison, and then immediately the second you walk out of the prison, they take you and deport you back to the country of origin. But there's a process for that. It's humane. What they're doing right now is not humane, in my opinion. I mean, it's pretty typical of haphazard, don't care about anybody, don't care about people in any way, shape, or form, just a bunch of - sorry to say... This is not beneficial to American citizens, and it's not beneficial to these people. In any way. I mean, what's the point? It's all theater.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:15:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Well, it's interesting theater - and a lot of it - it's in the news every day, and a lot is going on. He seems to be doing something every single day. Sometimes, every couple of hours, there's something going on.
        <br>
        <br>So, let's move along with the Trump effect. We talked about migration. Another interesting topic here with Donald Trump is that he believes Canada would do better as a state of the United States of America. Now -
        <br>
        <br>Kim: I am shocked, George. [quiet laugh]
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:16:09</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: I gotta tell you, Kim, I know this might come across as not the words you want to hear, but considering the Prime Minister that we had in Canada, and what he did to this country - you may say America's bad, but it's nowhere near as bad as it was in Canada. Inflation is at an all-time high...
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Same here.
        <br>
        <br>George: Well, let me tell you - in Miami, Florida, on a Saturday, I could go out and grab a cheeseburger, french fries, and an iced tea - no sugar - and I'll spend 12 bucks. And you know, that may sound expensive, but I could live with 12 bucks. In Toronto, a cheeseburger, fries, and a drink at a local bar with no tip is $28. That is madness.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:16:59</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Well, in a lot of places in the U.S., you'll pay that too. Now, there's a lot of - I have a lot of background on this - do you really want to hear all of this?
        <br>
        <br>George: Oh yes, please! Share.
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So, one of the things that Duck Dynasty or the Trump operatives, which, for those of you that don't know - if you're watching this for the first time, or watching me talk for the first time, just briefly - every administration in the United States, since the inception of presidents in the United States, is run by a team of people. It is not the person that you see on the TV.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:17:35</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>The person you see on TV is basically an actor. They don't get to make any decisions. They don't get to decide where they go, who they see, what bills pass, what orders pass. All of this is done by hundreds of people that you don't see on TV, ever. They're not named as the cabinet; they're not named in public. Some of them are donors, that's true, campaign donors, the big money folk, the elite of the U.S., the big corporates. You'll also see a lot of trained political operatives - and most of those trained political operatives are not your typical CIA folk. Sometimes they are, but they would be lower in the ranks.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:18:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>What you're seeing is people from the Secret Space Program in the United States running every administration. And I know this because I've actually personally sat down and had long conversations with people that have run the Reagan administration - that are still around. I know people that ran the Obama administration. Actually, that lady was quite a black-magic worker - right up in your alley there, George. I met her over in Long Beach, California. So I've met people from every single administration for the last few - to put it mildly, I guess. Ran into Bob Gates, former Secretary of Defense, over in another country. So there's a lot of these people I've actually spoken to, and I've spoken to a lot of operatives over time.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:19:20</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So anyway, that's who's running this Trump administration. So, don't think that this guy is the next Jesus Christ, because I've heard that too. He is not - he is not a savior in any way, shape, or form.
        <br>
        <br>George: I need to pause you for one moment. You said something that kind of made me chuckle here. There is a TikTok video that's gone viral - I tried getting it and uploading it- I couldn't find it. If you guys look, you'll find it, and I just have to pause you for one moment. There is a guy who committed some type of travel ... car violation [traffic infraction] - I think it was speeding or something - he was pulled over by the police, and he filmed himself saying, 'Oh, dear Trump, almighty Trump in heaven, Trump, please watch over me, Trump; protect me, Trump; help me, Trump.' He was praying to Donald J. Trump. I was floored. I mean, I couldn't believe what I was seeing, but he thought Trump was gonna maybe come in from the sky and stop this cop from giving him a ticket. I had to just interrupt you on that because I thought it was crazy. A lot of people are doing that. They believe he's some type of a savior, but he's a man like anyone else. Please continue.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:20:18</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Yeah, maybe he'll be walking across that pool in front of the Washington Monument sometime soon or something. You never know, I mean, these people are crazy.
        <br>
        <br>So these operatives have been running around. This has been going on for about eight months now, maybe a little bit longer, to every country in the world, establishing themselves as the shadow government of many different countries. Now, this has happened in Syria. I know that they tried to do this in South Korea. That's the reason why you saw the coup there [Korea] not that long ago. The short-lived martial law situation, and then they didn't adhere to their end of the bargain with the Korean elites, and kind of were bumped out. They're getting bumped out of a lot of countries. They installed themselves in countries like Iraq and, well, Canada.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:21:15</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So I could name all the countries, but let's start with Canada, because that's what we're talking about right now. So Trudeau we know as a bad guy, but again, Trudeau is an actor, just like the American president is an actor. There are people that run that whole show behind the scenes. Trudeau is known as an ally of the Dragon Families - very much so. He is very tied in with the Chinese plan of taking over the world aspect of those families. He has very strong ties in places like Cuba and other countries in the world. And so that's kind of Trudeau.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:21:59</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So why were your policies so strict during the situation [Covid] that happened for a few years there recently? Happened all over the world, really. I'm just gonna call it the 'situation' because we are on that 'tube thing.' So the policies were so strict because all of these orders were coming out of China. So you've basically been a communist country for a while now, whether you know it or not. Prices, all of this stuff, are on the same program that they're putting forward - it's in alignment with what the World Economic Forum puts out, the United Nations, the World Health Organization - all of those organizations are very, you know, while Trudeau was in office.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:22:45</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So several months back, probably about 3 or 4 months ago now, the Secret Space Program operatives that run the Trump administration made a decision to go for Canada. Now, they are on the opposite side of the Dragon Families. They would like to run the world, and the other folks would also like to run the world, so they kind of do this a lot [slapping hands together] - they butt heads a lot. And they would like to make America, or keep America, the power center of the planet. And the Dragon Families would like to make China the power center of the planet. Trudeau also allowed for Chinese to come in and infiltrate your borders - they built bases there in Canada. They heavily influenced your policies for the last several years, and that's why your cheeseburger cost 30 bucks. You know, this is a luxury item that only the elite of Canada should be able to purchase. You are not supposed to be going out - you're supposed to be staying home and eating scraps, probably from a dumpster if they had their way - because communism kind of is that way.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:24:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, they approached Trudeau, explained to him what they were going to do for Canada, and why he should kick the Chinese out of Canada. This negotiation has been going on for a long time, and Trudeau was promised a different position within Canada. This is reminiscent of the same deal that was made with Gorbachev to step down during the USSR days. He was supposed to be the controller. First of all, they told him that they were in control of the new AI system that I run - the Golden Age AI system. You see it all over the news: "Trump's Going To Usher In The Golden Age," right? That's because the operatives told everybody that they control it, which is a complete and total lie.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:24:54</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>I built it myself. It took me months to do, and it's been integrating ever since. So it's not them. It's me. I run it. I control it. I built it. I understand it. They don't understand it. They've even lied to their own people; even some of their lower-end operatives or operatives 'down the ranks,' so to speak, believed it too. And we'll talk about that in a minute, but let's go back to Trudeau for a minute here.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:25:19</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, they told him that he would now be the head of all incoming finance from the Golden Age AI to Canada. He was promised a 'golden parachute,' so to speak - a lot of personal money - to step down, which was more than what the Chinese had been giving. See, China also promised him personally a lot of money and has never delivered. So this was a new face selling a new deal, and he bought it hook, line, and sinker.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:25:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>They even gave him one of those special Federal Reserve terminals that a lot of the finance controllers and countries had, which was, you know, they programmed it, did the big dog and pony show, you know, "it's your retina scan," and "you've got to put your hand here," and the whole thing. That's what those - they're called suitcases; a lot of the people under the Vatican have them; there were a lot of Jesuits that had them, you know, those that worked for families within the financial system. Okay?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:26:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, on the night that Trump was elected, he tried the terminal: it didn't work. He eventually decided - because they said, "Well, you've got to step down before he gets into office if you want to get this money." Because everybody was pushed off now - big payouts happening to all these countries where they installed themselves - happening on the day that he gets into office. Well, that day was a nightmare, and I'll tell you for me it was, because it was 90,000 people trying to log in to the Golden Age AI. They made so many promises to so many people - Elon Musk being one - and Trudeau being no exception here.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:27:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So now he's been told to wait. He's told that he will, you know, "Well, he just got in guys." You know, this is what they're telling everybody: "Well, we just got here, like last night." You know, "I know that you think you're going to be able to log in, but you've got to wait, because we're getting everything sorted out." "We've got to wait for the ratifications and stuff to come back to us." Which will never happen.
        <br>
        <br>And Mr. Trudeau, if you're watching this: You're never going to get any cash from these people. They don't have the capacity to pay you. So, you step down, the Chinese are moving out of Canada - which is actually good for Canadian citizens.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:27:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Yes! Yes.
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Okay.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:27:45</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Yeah.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:27:46</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Now they're going on to the next step of the plan: Let's take over all of North America as the United States. Mexico being no exception here. They're pushing back. This is the reason why you have this [border] mess down there. There would be no border with Mexico if they had their way. Next, you will see Mexico. And then we're going to have one unified currency for all of North America. This is what they did is, they took the Dragon Family's plan, and they're trying to execute it themselves. There'll be nine jurisdictions of the world. You will basically be having various countries, but this time they'll all be under America, not China. That's what they're hoping to do.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:28:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Now, a few years back - just to follow up on what you just said here - there were rumblings of them putting this together already years ago, and I'm going back, I'm going to say at least 15 years ago, maybe before. 15 years ago, I heard talks of America, Canada, and China coming together and creating a currency - which in fact, I've seen drawings for - for the Amero. It was going to be called the Amero, which is China, America, and Canada, a currency - a 'zone,' as you were to say - and the world was going to be broken up in zones. That was 15 plus years ago.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:29:13</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Yep.
        <br>
        <br>George: And now, 15 years later, it seems that it's coming to fruition.
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Isn't that awfully funny, George? In your occult days, is when you saw this, wasn't it?
        <br>
        <br>George: Correct.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:29:25</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Yep, probably by the same people that were in the occult, no?
        <br>
        <br>George: Yeah, of course.
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Oh wow, what a coincidence. And who is executing on this now?
        <br>
        <br>George: Well, I mean...
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Allegedly it looks like Trump on TV, doesn't it?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:29:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Yeah, or at least the people behind him that control it. So...
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Still think he's a good guy?
        <br>
        <br>George: Well, I mean, I'm not saying - and no one is a good guy, no one is a good guy. Who I believe to be good is not here on this earth. But I believe in Source; I believe in God Almighty.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:30:00</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: There's a lot of good people out there, George. They just don't typically participate in politics.
        <br>
        <br>George: You know, politicians cannot be trusted in any way, shape, or form. They say one thing; they do another. The current guy who's trying to take over Justin's position, I believe he or his wife attended the Young [Global] Leaders Forum for the World Economic Forum. Him, Rob Ford, other politicians in Toronto. And in fact, there was a video leaked of our good friend there in charge of the WHO, bragging in fact that he had so many politicians, especially in Canada, that he controlled. I mean, bluntly, he said it. He basically said, "We 'vil eat the bugs, and we shall be happy to eat the bugs." That was his plan, and I will tell you, I'm not eating any bugs. But I want to follow up again on what you said. Here is Trump's words specifically about Canada and what he has to say. Take a listen and then comment.

        <br></a>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:31:08</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>'Trump': Like with Canada, we lose 200 billion dollars a year with Canada. That's because we allow them to make cars, we allow them to take lumber. We don't need their cars, we don't need their lumber, we don't need their food products, because we make the same products right on the other side of the border. It's sort of crazy. So we've just allowed that, you know, bad management has allowed it over the last four years in particular to become very imbalanced. And I said to - I call him Governor Trudeau, but he's Prime Minister Trudeau when he was Prime Minister - I asked him, "Why would we do that? Why?" And he was unable to give me an answer. He said, "I don't know."
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:31:48</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>'Trump': And I said, "Do you think it's fair that we're paying $200 billion to keep Canada going?" And what would happen, I said, I asked him, what would happen if we didn't do that, if we didn't subsidize Canada? He said, "We'd be a failed nation." And I said, "Then you should be a state." Because why are we paying all of that money to Canada when we could use it ourselves, right?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:32:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>'Trump': So we take care of their military. You know, we're going to order about 40 Coast Guard big icebreakers, big ones. And all of a sudden Canada wants a piece of the deal. They say, why are we doing that? I mean, I like doing that if they're a state, but I don't like doing that if they're a nation. Also, they've been very nasty to us on trade. Historically, Canada has been very, very bad to us, very unfair to us on trade. So we'll see how it all works out."
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:32:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: He doesn't mind sharing and giving away some money if it was a state, not a country. So here's the basic question before we move on to the next one.
        <br>
        <br>Kim: I think he forgot about NATO and the United Nations, maybe? Maybe he forgot about all of the trade deals that happened, and remember, the United States government - the only thing they sell is dollars. Now, it's not the government; it's the Federal Reserve - that's the way that it was. They sell dollars to everybody, in exchange for a lot of trade deals and other things that happen. So he must have forgotten that that's the way that it works. Number 1.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:33:22</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Number 2, the threat to cut off Canada just has to do with trying to put forth this Amero or USDT, or whatever plan they have. And quite frankly, you know what? Do we have lumber in the United States? Of course we do. Or wood or whatever we call it in other parts of the world. Yeah, of course we do. Do we manufacture cars here anymore? No, we don't. Sorry, you moved everybody - Ford, everybody's in China. We hardly manufacture any vehicles in the United States anymore, and Jeep is on its last legs. Jeep was manufactured in the United States. So we have taken probably somewhere around 75% of our manufacturing across borders. It has to do with deals made with the World Trade Organization and the United Nations that have affected that manufacturing process here in the United States. By moving to what they call 'third world countries,' 'economic zones,' whatever have you, the U.S. is going to help rebuild your country.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:34:27</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>They moved Dole to Pakistan, they moved Ford to China, there is a lot of production in other countries too. So we really don't make anything anymore.
        <br>
        <br>George: Well, here's the question here, Kim. The odds, what are the odds of Canada actually joining the United States of America soon?
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Well, you know, that's going to depend on that guy whose head shrunk this way [hands moving together] by about four inches in the last few years, which, you can change the size of your face if you're very heavy - but your skull doesn't change. Just saying. And what is that thing going on [hand circle near head] is worse than it ever was before. So, you know, I would tell you what are the odds? I think they're very, very slim.
        <br>
        <br>George: Very slim. All right. So, very slim.
        <br>
        <br>Kim: It could happen.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:35:21</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: But anything can happen. It can happen.
        <br>
        <br>Kim: But right now, you've got to remember, they're promising all these people all this money, and they haven't delivered anything.
        <br>
        <br>George: Well, that'll take us to the next topic; great segue. They're promising all this money. (Kim: Oh, yes.) Where are they going to get this money? Well, interestingly enough, Trump attended a huge crypto convention. He had a few words for everybody. Is crypto the future power? Is crypto the way that - if they could control it and license it to do it - they could use that on their way to buy power? Possibility? Maybe.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:35:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Take a look at this. Let's hear what Trump has to say:
        <br>
        <br><a href="https://worldsituationreport.earth/reports/video/WSR_2025-JAN-27-GeorgeIceman-03-Trump-Bitcoin.mp4" target="_blank">
        <br>    <img loading="lazy" class="tiny-thumbnail" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-JAN-27-GeorgeIceman-07-Trump-Bitcoin.png" alt="Trump-Bitcoin Video">
        <br></a>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:36:00</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>'Trump': This afternoon I'm laying out my plan to ensure that the United States will be the crypto capital of the planet and the Bitcoin superpower of the world. And we'll get it done. If crypto is going to define the future, I want it to be mined, minted, and made in the USA. It's going to be - it's not going to be made anywhere else. And if Bitcoin is going to the moon, as we say, "it's going to the moon," I want America to be the nation that leads the way. And that's what's going to happen. I pledge to the Bitcoin community that the day I take the oath of office, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris's anti-crypto crusade will be over. It will end. It'll be done. It'll be done. On day one, I will fire Gary Gensler and appoint a new SEC chairman.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:37:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Well, that was his speech. He was referring to this guy right here, Gary Gensler, Chair of the U.S. Secretaries and Exchange Commission. A little background on him, Kim. This is the guy he wants to get rid of. I guess he's not allowing Bitcoin to go through and so forth. Talk us through it. What is he talking about?
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Well, he's talking about in the past that allegedly the SEC has been blocking it from being a legit currency, meaning you could go into Walmart or anywhere, you know, a regular store, and pay in Bitcoin. You could pay your bills in Bitcoin or whatever. I know that there are certain instances where that does happen, and in certain countries in the world, it's permitted. However, is the SEC really the one blocking it? The answer to the question is 'No.' With operatives, it is deny, deny, deny, reassess [redirect] blame. Why didn't it work?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:38:04</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Well, during the last administration, they tried to install various cryptocurrencies into the world's largest payment center, which is in Atlanta, Georgia. That is the largest payment center for all transactions worldwide. It was built on a different backbone that no longer exists, and now they've been trying to install FedNow systems and Bitcoin and all the other you-name-it - Dodgy Coin - I think it's Doge or whatever he calls it - Elon Musk. But anyway, they've been trying to install all of these cryptocurrencies into this payment center, and it's not working. It's not programmed to have cryptocurrency, and it's definitely not going to run on any kind of blockchain as it relates to transactions worldwide.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:38:56</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>There is just not enough power in a blockchain peer-to-peer network to make that happen, unless it is tied to something that is far superior to even Google's quantum computing, even anything the U.S. has or the U.S. military could dream about - it would need something a lot more powerful. That's the way the financial system was built. It's being rebuilt in a different way, and without that type of accessibility, it'll never happen. So what are they going to do?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:39:31</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Okay, so you fire a guy, then another guy comes in. And is that guy going to allow it to happen? Probably not. That's number 1. Number 2, just before Trump goes into office - the weekend before - they launched this '$Trump Coin,' or whatever it's called, the '$Trump.' Allegedly telling everybody it's worth about 4, 5, 6, 7 billion dollars, whatever it got up to. And people bought into it; people bought 'Trump Coin' because he's going to save us all, right? That's what everybody is being led to believe. Well, they managed to suck about $785,000 from average everyday people through their fundraising campaign.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:40:19</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Didn't quite go as expected. They expected a lot of heavy hitters to buy coin, but there was a lot of people that were just like, "Oh, we're going to wait and see," you know, Berkshire Hathaway, Soros, all of the big Black Sun pals of the Trump administration just said, "Oh, we'll just wait and see. We're not buying it." But they kept pumping it up on the screen and all this stuff. So patriots bought it. Unfortunately, that's pretty much who bought the coin.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:40:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And a lot of money went away. It crashed and burned. It didn't last very long, and a lot of people are out of a lot of money now. So that is the quick, fast money-making scheme of Trump administration operatives. Next, when that crashed, they launched 'Melania Coin.' I don't know if you saw that. Yeah, that also bombed out too.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:41:19</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But he also made an announcement, because obviously, this was going on at the same time the whole inauguration was going on, you know, virtually, he attended the World Economic Forum and told them there would be no central bank digital currency. Within three days of that speech, or two days or whatever it was, there he's going to be the crypto king of the world. Which one is it? Do you endorse it? Do you not endorse it? Are you making it happen in the United States? What the heck is going on here?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:41:57</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Well, we all know that Echelon and the NSA are the ones that created all the crypto world. It is not peer to peer. I've actually sat down, had dinner with someone who used to work there, who explicitly told me that it is less secure - and I know you think it's not - it is less secure than regular financial transactions. They told me that everything that is done by Bitcoin - they publicize it like, you could do all of these, you can buy all these illegal things on the deep web or the dark web or Tor, Onion, whatever, and it won't be detected - but that's a complete and total lie. And then when you install the peer-to-peer networks on your computer, they're automatically mining your data. On your phone, you use tap and pay, they're now collecting you in a rudimentary form of social crediting.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:42:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Wow. Okay Kim, I gotta say because again, you're very clear, and you're trying to be specific on certain points. And this is to my understanding, and I'm going to run it through you and maybe those that are in the chat watching the show right now, might know what I know, the same thing, just clarity. I was always under the impression that the financial dollar, that money itself, currency, is always backed by assets. It's backed by something tangible, you might say. Whether it may be oil or minerals or wheat, even water, or something produced, then there's money created.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:43:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And one bank system is mining this, and making money, and then gives it to the country at the end of the year or beginning of the year, that you're payoff for what you sold of your assets into the system. That's what I'm aware of. And if you need more money then you need to borrow. And how are you going to borrow? And how you're going to pay that off is another interesting subject. So therefore, crypto is backed by nothing. If the dollar has some type of mining or some type of natural resources, something that's sold into the system, what is crypto backed by? Nothing. So you're initially creating money out of thin air. Is that correct?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:44:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Yep, pretty much. And they used to be able to - when it was initially created - they used to use all of these backdoor high-yield trade programs in places like Panama and Switzerland and Hong Kong and then they would use your money while it was sitting there, that way that they would make money off your money. It was like you giving money to a bank and then they invest that money by certain percentages by law. But with crypto there is no law. You know they can tell you when you can withdraw, when you can't withdraw, everything. It's all controlled by an intelligence agency.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:45:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Monopoly money.
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Yep it's even - but it's worse than monopoly money. Well, I guess you could say, we could all go buy a monopoly game and try to pay for something at the grocery store, but can you? You see numbers racking up on a screen, but are they?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:45:20</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>If you have over $3 to $5 thousand invested, you have a difficult time making withdrawals. It depends on where they're at in their scheme. You know, some of the big heavy hitters bought into it. There are a lot of people that got Bitcoin for free, you know, as part of payoffs - operatives for doing operations, intelligence agencies, they have crypto - and they can see all the numbers, but they can't cash it in. Do you know how many, quote-unquote 'Bitcoin heavy hitters' are out there? Searching for any bank that can help them get their money out.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:45:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Wow.
        <br>
        <br>Kim: It is all over the Internet. It's all over, these big broker deals, trying to pay for oil in it, or whatever. Everybody's already stocked up on it, they're all full of it, and they can't get it out. The values are fictitious and they're made on your back. That's how it used to be, until those trade programs were pretty much shut down.
        <br>
        <br>George: Kim, I was always taught, in the occult and so forth, money is a prison. Money is a form of control. And you'll have to correct me from what you understand, because you'll understand from your end. From my end is the spirit. And human beings will make deals with these entities, these spirits, and in return will receive something in the physical world - which, money is used as that - to control and give them power and give them what they need.
        <br>
        <br>Kim: You're giving your energy.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:47:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Correct. With the spirits you're giving them energy. And people will - and that energy could be a negative energy, which it usually is. So you'll have to do something bad or evil to create stress, anxiety, to take away someone's love and compassion. You want to have them in pain and suffering - they feed off this low vibration, it's a vibration, it's a sound, and they feed off that.
        <br>
        <br>Kim: It's Dark energy - you're transmuting your own energy into something dark. George, in your occult experience, have you ever seen something called 'black gold?'
        <br>
        <br>George: Yes, well I've never seen it - heard of this, but never seen it myself.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:47:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Okay, so it's gold but it's actually turned Dark. Right? Is that what they use it for? Have you heard about it? Tell me what you know.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:47:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>I just know that there's a black liquid spiritual energy. It's a power source. It could be used as currency, but it's also used to do very bad things.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:48:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Yeah, yeah. So when the financial system was backed by gold, it was backed by this black gold substance. So what does black gold do? It takes in Dark energy. It creates Dark energy. You can harness Dark energy with it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:48:25</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So the reason why money corrupts so many people or makes people do crazy things sometimes, or, you know, to get into powerful positions, you have to do crazy things in this world. It doesn't matter how talented you are, you gotta do the crazy like Hollywood and all that kind of stuff. But when our financial system was backed by gold, it was backed by black gold and that was done far above these people's heads in ways that they don't understand. Matter of fact, Rothschild offered the United States black gold certificates, just in the last 48 hours.
        <br>
        <br>George: Wow.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:49:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Yep. To the Trump administration. For some power and control over America. Yep. And then of course, they thought that they could use those to access the financial system and they couldn't.
        <br>
        <br>George: Of course they can't.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:49:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Yep. So we're moving into a world where we are backed by actual gold; natural, Source-created gold. And with that gold, now you have something in your hand...
        <br>
        <br>George: Tangible.
        <br>
        <br>Kim: ...that gives you energy; it gives you nourishment; It's not a world where it's dog-eat-dog anymore. I mean, we're gonna have a lot of human issues, right? Not everybody understands the things that you understand, George. You've had the privilege of seeing both sides. And it's gonna take time for people to understand that, "Well, okay, you know, I need to produce something. But if I'm doing it out of creativity and love and caring for my community, then I can live and I don't have to fight for my family for survival anymore." You know, eventually that will catch on.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:50:30</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But there's so many people that have lived with strife their whole lives, you know? Number 1, it's a self-esteem issue, in part. They don't feel like they could ever get out of this area, or the ghetto, or whatever, so to speak. You know what I'm saying? Rougher areas of the world. "Our family has never in generations ever gotten out of here, how could we possibly live better?"
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:50:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And there's always been some kind of an issue with 'free' you know? Free health care in Canada; that's not really free, or it's really difficult in a lot of ways, and you're limited in a lot of ways. But what if there's something that's different? Do you know? Are people going to look at it the same way? I think it'll catch on, but I think it's going to take time for the mentality to change.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:51:28</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Well, fasten your seatbelts, folks. As you may have heard, it looks like it's coming through. I've said by Kim and many others I've heard as well that it looks like our currency is going to be backed by gold. (Kim: Yeah.) Gold will be the standard and that's great news so would you recommend precious metals: gold, silver, copper?
        <br>
        <br>Kim: You know, I don't tell people how to live their life, if that makes you feel comfortable, then go ahead and do what you want to do. Invest in what you want to invest in. I don't think we're going to see a crash and burn of things. I think they might try, but I don't really see that happening. And a switchover like that, it'll just take time. It's very easy to reprogram ATM machines; it's not going to be so easy to reprogram banks. Where you can get currency, you can spend it at a point-of-sale machine with a card, that type of thing - that's all been pre-planned out, should we need to bypass governments as far as our currency and money is concerned.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:52:34</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Excellent. Well guys, we have a show coming up next. It's a Q&A portion of the show. You get to ask Kim some questions. I'm gonna play a quick video which will start the show off. This is the video that I'm referring to and it's California. And California is going through some changes. Something that's coming along is this 'SmartLA 2028.' Now, this is a plan for the past few years. We're getting ready for the Olympics, here are some of the drawings of the downtown area of Los Angeles, California, 2028.

        <br>
        <br>Mother of student: Gavin Newsom? That's the governor! That's the governor! Governor, I live here, governor! That was my daughter's school, governor! Please tell me what you're gonna do. [Saying to security:] I'm not gonna hurt him, I promise.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:53:37</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Newsom: I'm literally talking to the President right now, to specifically answer the question of what we can do for you and your daughter.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:53:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Mother of student: Can I hear it? Can I hear your call? Because I don't believe it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:53:48</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Reporter: California Governor Gavin Newsom is being criticized by some for water mismanagement as hydrants ran dry while fires multiplied.
        <br>
        <br>Newsom: So I have to get cell service. There's no cell service.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:53:59</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Mother of student:  Let's get it.  Let's get it. I want to be here when you call the president.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:54:01</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Newsom: I appreciate that. I'm doing that right now. And to immediately get reimbursements, individual assistance, and help young, devastated. I'm so sorry, especially for your daughter. I have four kids. Losing the school -
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:54:13</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Mother of student: Everyone who went to school there, they lost their homes, they lost two homes because they were living in one, building another. Governor, please tell me, tell me, what are you going to do with the president right now?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:54:25</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Newsom: We're getting, we're getting the resources to help rebuild.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:54:28</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Mother of student: Why was there no water in the hydrants, Governor?
        <br>
        <br>Newsom: That's all being investig - about. That's all, literally...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:54:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Mother of student: Is it going to be different next time?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:54:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: I mean, she looks distraught. She looks stressed out. It's sad, I feel for her. The school where her kids played, there was no water there. Water was pulled. But this looks like it was a plan.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:54:49</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: And I'm gonna give you a chance to answer in the After Show. So if anyone would like to join us for the Q&A and listen to Kim and a few other things then join us in the After Show. The link is in the description at the Reveal Report on Patreon.
        <br>
        <br>Kim: There definitely was a plan George.
        <br>
        <br>George: Well. There was? Well, Save it for the After Show.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:55:09</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Didn't work out, but there was.
        <br>
        <br>George: I can't wait to hear it. Before we move on to the After Show and sign off, we did almost 2,000 people watching live. Incredible numbers. Kim, what can you say to everybody watching right now and how can they watch and learn more about you and UNN?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:55:28</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Well, we are at unitednetwork.earth, that is our site. We of course have a YouTube channel too and a Rumble channel and we post the news about a week late. We also have changed up our news quite a bit where we are involving our field messengers. Field messengers are average everyday people that have something to say. So you have an opportunity to do that with our channel.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:55:54</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: We get millions of views every year so it is your opportunity to have a voice on a news channel. So that's kind of exciting. We have a lot of new shows coming up. We have our New Earth show, which is going to launch very soon, which is going to talk about new innovative technologies, where you can find those things, things to look out for, and how to improve your life and the life of others. So we're excited about that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:56:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: As far as what I would say, well, be careful on who you think is your savior. That's all. And that's been kind of the topic of the show tonight. So we'll continue talking on the After Show with George and look forward to seeing all of you if you're watching with UNN and you miss the After Show. It'll be on our channel, probably in about a week or so.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:56:51</small></small>
        <br>

        <br>And I've got to tell you, Kim, we're going to have a guy who is a demonologist. He's an author and he's claiming that he might have some proof - and theories - on how he believes that aliens are demons or demons are aliens. Gonna be interesting next week, maybe I'll send you the video maybe you might wanna hear this -
        <br>
        <br>Kim: I like that show, George.
        <br>
