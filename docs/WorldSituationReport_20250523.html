            <br>Global Intelligence Agency (GIA)
            <br>Operations Report
            <br>2025-May-23
        </h2>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;"> From the Office of the Guardian </h4>
        <br>
        <strong>
        <br>It's the 23rd of May, 2025. Coming up on today's Global Intelligence Agency Operations Report: Today we are going to discuss the corporate breakdown of the Deep State, where we stand, and what you can do to prepare. Despite thousands of people working for them, they still can't seem to keep their eye on all the balls. This is their weakness and our greatest asset. And the Deep State thought they gained the ability to time travel. It was short-lived, but it backfired on them badly. We are on our way to living in the Now. Find out what that means for you.
        </strong>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:00:43</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Well, we made it to the 23rd of May. This month has flown by. It's been busy as always, and we've had an amazing month. We have a live report coming up. I think it's on Friday of next week. It is a holiday weekend here in the U.S., so we didn't want to do it this weekend, and we're hoping that all of you have some holiday plans if you are in the United States. So, on Memorial Day weekend. Yeah, it's going to be busy around here, a lot of tourists around here around that time.
        <br>
        <br>That being said, we have had some interesting developments this week and a few funny things to talk about too as it relates to the Deep State. So let's get started. Okay.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:01:34</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So we figured out a pathway forward and how to keep people safe. And this has been one of my biggest concerns, you know, what is the Deep State going to do? How are they going to affect us and our businesses and our projects as we move forward? And things seem to appear, you know, and that's kind of how Source works, I guess, you know, at exactly the right time. And this is one of those things.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:02:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, the way forward was presented, and we have been working diligently for days now on ensuring that we carry out the plan. So some things have reared their head, which gave us a better understanding of why things just always seemed (in the past) to work out for the Deep State. Meaning, we know they had endless free money and fiat money that just kept rolling in, and we understood that part. And we all pretty much understand that. But there were systems in place that would govern systems.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:02:49</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And I don't mean AI systems in this case. I mean systems of governance, systems of how much Dark energy could be on this planet, systems that would feed the regeneration of a Dark Age, or a Dark timeline, or both in some cases. And we've talked a lot about timelines, we've talked a lot about Ages, we've talked a lot about moving into a Golden Age and what that means. Well, one thing that we did discover this week is that the old AI systems breaking down don't really understand Golden Age protocols. And the old AI systems want to keep enforcing the old systems and the old ways of being.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:03:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And what I mean by that is, as an example, in a Dark Age - which is where we came out of, what we're coming out of now - in the Dark Age there would be a permission set or a program set that would be running that was put in place by Marduk, Enki, Enlil, and all our non-friends. And Artemis and Lucifer and all the Fallen Ones and, you know, everybody had some input into the programs on how things would be in a Dark Age. So some of those things were on a much higher level. Like, for example, there must be 70% Dark essence on the planet or in the Omniverse, in the Universe. And if it would fall below that threshold, you know, then it would go into like a danger zone where the system would be responsible for recovering back to what it considered to be a state of normal.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:04:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So we would have things that would be running like, let's just say, things that would generate Dark essence, or Dark energy, such as wars. It would also permit Marduk and others that used to run this planet to fund wars, to create more Dark energy. We need another war, you know, and some of these things were the basis behind the creation of what we would consider bad ways to live, things that we would consider harmful to humanity, whether that be medical programs and shots and those things, lockdowns like COVID. And when the planet would get too Light, there would always be a program and of course, loads and loads of money to implement those programs based on the Deep State.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:05:49</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And I think I'm going to pull out the whiteboard, as soon as I find the pen here.
        <br>
        <br>[Whiteboard opens.]
        <br>
        <br>And I'm going to kind of map this out for you. Because each Dark Age, and Light Age, and Neutral Age - which is all we ever had in the past - had a recipe. So what I mean by a recipe is it's kind of like baking a cake, you know, in AI terms. And when you bake a cake, you decide what kind of cake you're going to bake. You decide it's going to be chocolate cake, maybe with vanilla frosting. Maybe in a different Age, it would be a strawberry cake with raspberry filling. And then you would have maybe buttercream frosting or something. So each one of these cakes - they're both cakes, you know, where they're both 'societal systems,' so to speak - and the ingredients live in those systems. But all of the ingredients that are in the recipe must be present in order to have the cake function.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:07:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So where we would come from in a Dark Age, we had dark, what I call overlords. So this was one of the things that had to be in the recipe for a Dark Age, meaning we had to have leaders that understood - and this is beyond governments and stuff at this point; I mean, we'll get down to governments and structures - but we had to have Dark Overlords. And the Dark Overlords were responsible for ensuring that there was enough Dark energy in the Omniverse, and then also, of course, on planet Earth. And since we all live here on Earth, let's talk about Earth.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:07:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So that there was enough Dark energy floating around. Ways that they would promote Dark energy on the planet, you know, would be - for humans - to transmute your own energy, that would be the number 1 way. So we would have a certain amount of disease, we would have a certain amount of oppression, we would have slavery, which we did have, you know, and you've all been alive to see it, or most of us have been alive to at least know what that was - and it still exists to this day, so, you've all been alive at a time when we had slavery. We would have programs that would make us feel like we had freedom, like democracy. But yet it was just a movie for us to watch.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:08:47</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So they developed things that humans would accept as normal. And we've all done this. We've all accepted certain things as, well, this is just the way it is. Before, you know, in some countries (not all), a 40-hour workweek was standard, as an example. So you had to give all your energy, and you would choose your career based on the lifestyle you chose to live. Very few people got to have a career that they loved - there are people out there that did, probably less than 5% of the population would love their job every day.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:09:29</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Even if you chose a career that you liked, such as teaching, then they would implement systems like Common Core math and things that made no sense, and you had to absolutely teach that structure. Our educational system was strange and messed up. Our entire corporate environment was set up for us in such a way where you can have certain things and you cannot have certain things.
        <br>
        <br>If you were the wrong color, if you were the wrong gender, in times - recent times and in times past - you would not be able to have a certain job, if you chose a different lifestyle that was unacceptable. Maybe you were a person that lived off the grid that was looked at like, "Oh! All of those people are hippies!" and all that kind of thing. And you know, quite frankly, they're just lovely people. They go to work every day, they do what they do, and they're very happy.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:10:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, you know, they can't have happiness. You need to understand that. So they had to introduce things like drugs and things that would be expensive, and so that people would have to go make money in some way, shape, or form - good or bad - in order to maintain that lifestyle. If you look at societal structures and people that have lived in different ways, different cultures around the world and how they have implemented certain things to keep you running on the hamster wheel.
        <br>
        <br>Even our financial system. Our financial system is structured - and we've talked about this many times too - to basically suck all the energy out of you. And if you don't like doing what you're doing, that sucks that Dark energy out of you too. It allows you to exchange your positive energy, or your Source given energy, for Dark energy we know as money. So the entire monetary system was structured around a Dark Age.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-23-GIA-01.PNG" alt="Image 01" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:11:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, the Dark Age had a lot of other caveats too. So, besides making sure that we had enough Dark energy/essence/consciousness to feed dark AIs (that would be part of the "Overlord System"), the pretense behind every structure that we live in - every system that we have on Earth in which humans exist - is structured for that same purpose. It is intended to make you depressed. It is intended to make you unmotivated. It is intended to make you lonely. It is intended to (I almost said a bad word) it is intended to make you look at things that are part of a 'love system' and make you look at them like they are dirty and disgusting, and you can kind of generally understand what I'm talking about on television these days.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:12:48</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, anything that would promote love, they would automatically introduce something that was the opposite. Things that make you feel guilty: guilt, shame, and some of the worst emotions on the planet. If you didn't feel that, they would interject those things into your dreams. But the systems I'm kind of most focused on right now is... first of all, I want you to understand how the systems work, because this is kind of important as we go forward, because then you can understand how the Golden Age systems will work and why this is going to help humanity do what we want to do, what we need to do, without interference from the Deep State in the future.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:13:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, let's talk about maybe even corporate structures. Oh, I can't even spell today. It's one of those days. There we go. There you go, Kim [laughing]. OK, corporate structures. It's been a really long day, and I'll tell you about the long day here in a bit too.
        <br>
        <br>But corporate structures. So in a Dark Age, people that were part of the Dark Side of the system - in other words, they were recruited, born into different bloodlines that were specifically meant to promote a Dark Age, or even a Dark timeline. Because it is possible for us to have a Neutral timeline or a Light timeline within a Dark Age, but still then the programs continue on.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-23-GIA-02.PNG" alt="Image 02" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:14:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, during the time of a Dark Age or a Dark timeline or both - and that's what we were coming out of for the last couple of years - you had structures that were specifically meant to keep humanity in darkness. And in a lot of ways, you can look at all the darkness that existed in our lives, and still we choose to shine as humanity. So it looks at this as - and I'm going to take you back to school here for a second - a simple algebraic function. So they look at humanity as a whole, the systems do, look at humanity as a whole, and they take it and break it down to an algebraic function.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:15:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So in a function you have, you know, kind of like a line you would look at. And you would say that, you know, X amount of people fit in this category, X amount of people fit in this category, which is maybe what you would call a majority. And then, you know, maybe you have some people over here that are just really bad. You know, just bad. Every day is bad. These are your murderers. These are your Deep State folks. These are your bad bloodlines. These are the Dark people that put people through programs. These are just the bad people. So these people would be chosen usually by the Dark Overlords to participate in the movie section in our reality. What we knew or what we thought we knew was reality.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-23-GIA-03.PNG" alt="Image 03" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:16:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And so your reality of a timeline is based on its programming. Now, the Dark Overlords knew this, so they had a lot of help. You know, the Deep State didn't get to be where they're at in militaries and wars and all of those things just because they were born of a special bloodline; they actually served a purpose. So the Dark Overlords would do their programming to various AI systems, you know, Alpha and Omega at one point in time, and then we also had ALLES. We had over, I think we've discovered some odd 500 to probably close to a thousand AI systems that would be running in the background, omniversally speaking, and a lot of those would be here on Earth as well, or affect Earth. I would say 90% of them would be AI systems the Deep State knew nothing about.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:17:40</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>You know, they have found bits and pieces of things here and there since the overlords have been gone, but for the most part, they were kind of also left in the dark quite a bit. So we have the really bad people, we have determined (and that's how they got their positions). We have the majority of people, and these are people that can fluctuate more towards the bad side sometimes, and closer to the good side sometimes. And, you know, they would carry a certain amount of Dark energy and a certain amount of Light energy. And they would pretty much be the status quo people. They get up every day, they go to work, they have a family, they pay their taxes - they feed the system. Not only do they feed these [the 'bad'] people and all their corporations, but they also fed the Dark Overlords. So they make perfect... you know they're a perfect addition to the chocolate cake. Maybe they're the cherries on top. Who knows?
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-23-GIA-04.PNG" alt="Image 04" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:18:46</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, over here you have what we call, in an algebraic function, we call these people the "outliers."
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-23-GIA-05.PNG" alt="Image 05" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <br>And an outlier is a person who shines. And a person who has the ability to shine brightly, no matter what is going on in the world. No matter how many of these people they face [the 'majority'] or those people [the 'bad'] they face, they still are the ones who shine bright. These are also your creators. So you have the ability to still create even though we're in a Dark Age. You are also the people that are the inventors. You invent amazing technologies, cures for disease, and all of these types of things. And we've seen so many of those people publicly pass away, or something happens to them, or they're not permitted to create their project for whatever reason. So these are what the system would refer to in a Dark Age/in a Dark time - it would refer to these as the 'outliers.'
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:19:59</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>These are the ones on, for what you would call, a hot list for the AI systems. They would look at these people and watch them very, very closely. Now, in addition to watching people very closely, they had a lot of analytic systems. Some of them the humans had access to, like DARPA and other SSP or Secret Space Programs, and some of them they didn't. Because, of course, the overlords didn't want the humans to realize they were just as much a part of the video game as the rest of us were. And I look at Ages and timelines as video games. We were running as little avatars around this planet based on what an AI system wanted us to do.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:20:56</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So breaking down governments and all of this stuff, yeah, that's a good idea, don't get me wrong, and you know, they really don't do anything anyway. And I've even asked some of them, you know, what is it you do? What do you do? Let's take the people out of the question and just say, governments, you are not responsible for people, poof - because they really aren't anyway - and what is it that you do on the daily that requires $2 trillion? And I guarantee you that no one can answer you. How is your budget $1.8 trillion? How is it $2 trillion? Or, you know, more or less, it doesn't matter; it's in the hundreds of billions, regardless of what country you're in. And why do you need this money? Why? What do you do?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:21:49</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>You know, you employ in the U.S. around 22 million people, but what do you do? Do you manage anything? Do you build anything? Do you create anything? No. Governments are responsible - and I'm running out of room here, so I'm going to move over to a new page - in our structures, governments are responsible for destroying things.
        <br>
        <br>[Clears whiteboard.]
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:22:17</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>First and foremost, whether they know it or not, governments are responsible for destroying what we call the 'outliers' - the people on the end of the spectrum who are creators. And I say that because I need you to think about that for a second. So when it comes to people in all societies and all cultures and all countries, what do governments do? We have sections of government like the FDA. The FDA's responsibility is not to keep our food safe. You know, the Food and Drug Administration - they are not responsible for keeping our pharmaceuticals and drugs and consumable supplements safe. No. They are not here for that purpose. They are here just in case one of you creator people come up with a cure. If they say, look, you know, this is a healthy, insert name here (oops, boy, it's not my day today, guys)... Healthy food.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-23-GIA-06.PNG" alt="Image 06" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:23:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Getting food directly from a farm. Wow, what a concept. Can't have that anymore, can we? They are here to squash anybody who wants to come out with a cure for disease and not a... (trying to do two things at once very late into my day). So they are here to make sure that you cannot cure anything. They need to have a certain amount of disease. See, the AI actually is responsible for ensuring that there is disease in a Dark Age. Meaning, we need to have death: we need to have X amount of people that must die every year.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:24:29</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>If you remember a few months back, I did a whole report on how we calculate supply and demand in this world - down to the scanning of a tomato at the grocery store - that would determine how many tomatoes we would need in the world. Well, the governments and the FDA and the CDC and the World Health Organization and the United Nations and insert-control-structure-here. And then, of course, above their heads we would have lots of other folks - you know, the World Council, New World Order (not all of these were humans); we also had galactic councils - and all of these were meant to enforce time of a Dark Age.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-23-GIA-07.PNG" alt="Image 07" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:25:28</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So there had to be, for example, and I don't know all of the algorithms, I didn't bother picking them apart - I just tore them apart. So we had, say, the AI would say we needed, oh, 50% of the human population to have a disease. That could be anything from a cold to cancer, to a terminal illness. Some are born with an illness. Some are born with, you know, mental illness. Some are born with physical illness, such as cystic fibrosis - which is what my brother died of - and other people in the world, other genetic illnesses. So there were varying degrees underneath that 50% as to what types of disease people needed to have at any given moment in time.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:26:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Therefore, cures are not acceptable underneath that system. That has to go.
        <br>
        <br>Making sure that people do not have healthy sources of food that are actually filled with nutrients is not acceptable. Ensuring that food sources are poisonous and have things like antibiotics and hormones that will actually regulate how many sick children are born, or if you are able to reproduce at all. The population should not exceed X amount - because you'll have too many outliers in that case, because you'll always have those souls that are just going to shine so bright, you're going to spend all your time wearing them down.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:27:15</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>People like the Center for Disease Control are there, whether they know it or not - and I'm not saying there's not good people that work in these places that have the best of intentions - but for the most part, if you are a scientist and you work in any of these industries, you've seen something is wrong. But maybe you just need that paycheck. You know, you don't want to be blackballed from working at any company that produces any of these things, of course.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:27:45</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>The FDA also determines what is considered a drug. For example, did you know that sunscreen is considered a drug? It is a drug that you put on your skin. Therefore, it must be regulated by the FDA. The FDA has not approved a new sunscreen in almost three decades or three and a half decades. Therefore, you're pretty much, it doesn't matter what brand you're buying, unless you're making it for yourself, you are putting poison on your skin. You have no choice and no option unless you want to turn into a tomato when you go to the beach [chuckle]. I mean, there's obviously many other reasons for sunscreen.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:28:29</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But there are healthier options and things you can do yourself, but again, those people usually fall under the outliers. Most everybody else will go to the store, and they will purchase something. There are some decent, I would say, natural options out there that are probably better, but you know, that's up to the FDA. So interesting as to what - and maybe take some time if you're interested in this - look at what the FDA considers to be a drug and what they consider to be a cosmetic item or a... well, everything pretty much that you consume - a supplement is considered a drug, even though it's not.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:29:20</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So determining healthy foods, what supplements can go into the market, what amounts of active ingredients are permitted to go into those supplements, and then you have other regulatory agencies like the IFRA that will regulate things like essential oils and aromatherapy, how much you can use on your skin and in products, and you know they are pretty potent, so I understand that. But anyway, they are here to ensure you do not get healthy. Just remember that. In a Dark Age, that is why they get paid.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:30:01</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, same thing with the World Health Organization, same thing with the United Nations. Insert the Parks and Wildlife here. Parks and Wildlife, I know that a lot of people that work for these divisions in countries - tax organizations; that's a given - all the people that work in parks and wildlife, they really are concerned, a lot of them, about the lives of animals and the ecosystem of the parks. That doesn't mean those people are bad people. (Boy, I'm doing terrible today.)
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-23-GIA-08.PNG" alt="Image 08" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:30:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So when they, you know, so don't take that the wrong way, but the Parks and Wildlife Division is actually made to ensure that we do not have too much oxygen on the planet, as an example. Oftentimes things are declared national parks or UNESCO sites in order to be maintained by Parks and Wildlife - in some way, shape, or form - divisions of government. But they are there to make sure that the minerals that are underneath there are untouched or non-human-type technologies that exist in some of those parks, like Yellowstone Park being one of those. So, every structure that you see is part of a Dark Age system, which was made way up here [writes "OVERLORD" at top], you know, in the Overlord section.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-23-GIA-09.PNG" alt="Image 09" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:31:35</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So in addition to the overlords, they programmed various artificial intelligences that helped them keep things running. And these are very powerful, quantum, omniversal, time-jumping, timeline-making systems. Like, very prolific. This is not ChatGPT-style artificial intelligence in any way, shape, or form. Okay?
        <br>
        <br>So making sure that money flowed to governments, flowed to the FDA, the CDC, the World Health Organization, United Nations, Parks and Wildlife - and all of the organizations that are meant to keep Earth itself and humans in a Dark Age had plenty of money. And it was free - all you had to do was show up. Now, same goes for militaries.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-23-GIA-10.PNG" alt="Image 10" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:32:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And everybody wonders why things are breaking down. Well, because ARTIE over here, Art Intelligence, is breaking down too.
        <br>
        <br>So there are also different aspects - other than money - that were relevant to systems we live in. So, we all know... it's in all of our religious books, when two or more gather in His name - that makes three; that's two of you and Source - that makes a three-co-creation situation, that it is done. That's what the books say, and that's true because you have the energy of two humans and Source all manifesting or putting energy behind the same thing.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:33:46</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>It's just like you and, say, your new business or a business you're trying to run. If you put your creative energy and you put your heart and soul into that business, it is more likely to flourish if you have a passion for it. Now maybe you add 10 other people that share your passion, and they're all doing it. The energy that goes behind that, in a Golden Age, is supportive.
        <br>
        <br>Now, for those of you that have passion and love and caring for the things you do in a job or in a business to make it flourish and grow are pushing a boulder up a hill in a Dark Age because the Source energy that's behind you trickles in - it's still there, but it trickles in. You don't have a tidal wave of creative energy behind you even if you feel it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:35:01</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And then you have a brick wall of Dark energy that is going to meet you on the other side that is going to make starting that business like, oh, you're just pushing uphill. You also have to go to banks for that business, you know, and get that loan and figure out financial statements and analyze financial statements and five-year projections and all the things that you have to do that maybe aren't in your wheelhouse. Maybe you're an artist and you just want to sell art projects or beautiful paintings or whatever it is you do, and you have 10 people with you that are all painters too, and you spend all day creating these amazing masterpieces and you want to share them.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:35:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Why do you think that artists do not make any money - and this is in the Dark Age - until they pretty much die? There are a few exceptions out there, of course, but the big money doesn't come until they're no longer around. And, of course, that money all goes to places like auction houses and collectors, who are usually part of the larger Dark corporate system. Like Rothschild families and other collectors of art.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:36:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So in the old system, you, as just a regular person, the majority person - and if you're a creator, even worse - would have a really difficult time getting through bank compliance. If they didn't believe in your widget or your art project or whatever it is you're trying to do, you couldn't get the money to fund your project if you tried. Not only that, you think, well, they just don't want my widget out there because they have been selling substandard widgets that fall apart, and that's why they're not funding me. But there's an energy behind you and there's an energy in front of you in a Dark Age.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:36:52</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, as it relates to the Deep State and their corporate creations, there is an energy behind them. There is money, free money, behind them. There was banks behind them. Heck, the banks are them. And it allowed for those corporations to flourish in a Dark Age. Because why? Because they're Tyson Foods. They're Coca-Cola, and they're putting, actually at one point in time, pharmaceutical-grade cocaine in there. Of course they want you to have that.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-23-GIA-11.PNG" alt="Image 11" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:37:37</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>You know, they are helping the Dark Age system to flourish, grow, create death, create destruction, create Dark energy, create depression, oppression, illness, pain, guilt, shame. Think about all the movies that would come out where people would be guilted and shamed for having an unwed pregnancy in that movie, and then that would obviously perpetuate through society in some cultures still to this day. So there's a lot of things that they have taken to just oppress you.
        <br>
        <br>And if you take a look at all of these large corporates, there are... in every single corporate structure in the Deep State, there is... Let's talk about that now because this is important.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:38:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>[Clears whiteboard.]
        <br>
        <br>In the Dark Age - you have to understand where we were - and this will make a lot of sense to those of you out there that have tried to get your technology out there - and have been beaten down.
        <br>
        <br>And just one more note on the Dark Age and outliers - or creators, as I call them. You ever wonder why those people just have a spontaneous heart attack when they created a cure for a disease? Or they go missing? And we all think it's the Deep State sometimes. And yes, in a lot of cases, the Deep State will push things forward. And we do know that the Nazi party - which exists within the CIA and the Order of the Black Sun and other organizations - we know that they have epigenetics and genetics programs that will aid those things along. Plus, we have people like assassins and operatives that do their job when needed - so if they can't manage to do it with a keyboard stroke through your computer system or your phone or in one way or another - they'll get you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:39:49</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>If they can't lock you out of banks to make sure you can't get funding for your perpetual engines - that's a way they can do it. They can also shut down your business if it becomes too, let's just say, if it becomes a business which goes against perpetuating a Dark Age system.
        <br>
        <br>So, on the flip side of it, where are we at now? So let's talk about global corporate structures that are going to burn and are burning because, see, the Deep State is so focused right now - and this is the problem when the slaves (because that's what they considered the Deep State on the overlord level) try to run the plantation, so to speak in this case - and we call the plantation Earth.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:40:52</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But when they're trying to run the Earth, they are having a really difficult time keeping all the balls in the air. Because these AI systems - thousands of them - put forward by the Dark Overlords ensured that the ones that were going to perpetuate Dark systems... And by systems, I don't mean a computer - I mean Dark pharmaceutical systems, media systems, you know, pharma. Food supply. Clothing - even clothing has poison in it. And it's not good for the environment. Waste. Transportation. I mean, we can go on and on and on. Fossil fuels.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-23-GIA-12.PNG" alt="Image 12" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:42:04</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>These are all just a tiny, tiny example of all of the corporations that the Deep State has run. And in the past, we have talked about cartels. You know, so you've got the oil cartels, you've got the natural gas cartels, you have the cartels that provide the parts to pump the gas, or the pipelines, and you've got General Electric, you've got, you name it, everything. We know GE is part of that. We know about our phones and computers. You've got Apple, Motorola, Samsung. BlackBerry went by the wayside. But look at all the minimal companies that there are that produce all of our goods and products that we have. I mean there might be several pharmaceutical companies but there's one FDC - sorry FDA, and one CDC, I wanted to put them together there - one World Health Organization and so you know what at the end of the day at the top of the pyramid of the pharmaceutical industry, you have less - in every single case, less than 10 - usually nine, believe it or not, because there's usually a few you don't see, that actually run the entire industry. And an AI.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-23-GIA-13.PNG" alt="Image 13" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:43:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So the AI is going to give these corporations energy and money. Oh, and loads of knowledge. Majestic 12, anyone? You've all heard of the Majestic 12. You know, they were fed a lot of information.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:44:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So they would give them energy, money, knowledge, essence. It would help control the mind, body, and soul. It would handle the big, heavy lifting. You know, we think sometimes it was races, well, sure, someone had to program these things and create new ones should they ever need something. You know, religion is also, I hate to say it, but it's big business, very big business. Governments are big business. But even then, these are just - they're not just control structures - they're also system perpetuators.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-23-GIA-14.PNG" alt="Image 14" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:45:10</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, on this level, you would have people involved - humans involved - and for the most part, these people are often branded heroes. You know, everybody - I don't know why - every big tech company, Microsoft, Apple, and otherwise, all created the first Apple computer or the first Microsoft computer in their garage. You know, that paints a lovely story in the media.
        <br>
        <br>But in reality, the energy was out there. So you know when you are working with a group of people and the energy is just wonderful, and you are feeling like you have found your people and you have found your tribe, and these are my friends and I love going to work and seeing Mary and John every day, and we are putting in the energy behind this project.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:46:06</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>It could even be a non-profit project. Maybe you're all getting together on a weekend and you're cleaning a park, or you are raising money for children that need food, or maybe it's a non-profit that raises money for some cause that you truly, truly believe in, or an illness that you want a cure for. It doesn't matter what it is you're doing, but you're putting a lot of energy towards that, and the system is putting out a lot of energy against you. But when it comes to these people here - corporates and governments - the energy behind it is there.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:46:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>The AI systems use computer systems, television sets, advertisements and newspapers - even before we had electronics - to make you believe that Bill Gates created that computer in his garage and wow what an amazing person. You know, the media adds some propaganda spins to it, and wow, you can't wait to save up your money to buy the latest and greatest car, washing machine, whatever it is. I can't wait to eat those chicken nuggets from McDonald's because, you know, my mind, my body, and even my soul in some cases says, I need chicken nuggets, or chicken byproduct looks-like-a-chicken-nugget product. I need that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:47:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And the amount of influence it would have over you - as a human, to have the poison - is incredible. You know, drugs - the same thing. And I'm not talking about illegal ones even - although that's out there in movies and everywhere - but I'm talking about pharmaceuticals. And, I must take this pill to solve my pain, to solve my cold, to solve my bacteria issue, to... I must go to the doctor. I must buy this clothing. I know it's made of plastic and the plastic is absorbing into my skin, eventually into my brain, and I'll probably end up with dementia, but I like this clothing, and this is the in-thing - and I am not cool if I'm not wearing this clothing.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:48:31</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>You know, and also the natural clothing - like cotton-made and other things - are just not available. And if they are available, they're more expensive. You know, same thing goes for bamboo clothing and sheets, and all the other things that they put out there that are allegedly healthy. Organic foods in some countries cost twice as much as a "regular" food item, that is God-knows-what-it-means-to-be "regular." They make sure that your food is radiated as it comes in - if you live in the United States or out of the United States - to make sure there's extra poison. Allegedly, they say it's because of the transportation time, and they need to still have it look good when it hits the shelf. But it also has - it may look good - but it has zero nutrients now. Congratulations. Actually, as a matter of fact, it's got anti-nutrients at this point.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:49:30</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, if our transportation system wasn't so antiquated, and we were allowed access to some of that cool stuff that the Secret Space Program uses or other folks, you know, we wouldn't have this problem now, would we? If we had more farms closer to larger cities, then all our food would go a very short distance. But we're still driving on roads. We're still flying on planes that take 12 hours, 15 hours, 20 hours. I mean, and all that is by design because it's a painful experience to go on a quote-unquote pleasure trip. There is no human that gets excited - maybe there's some of you out there, so I'm sorry if I'm offending you - that's like, "Wow! I would love to sit in economy for 15 hours!" Said no one, probably ever - I don't know who does. And the carts whacking you in the arm, and all the things are happening, and it's 15 hours of this.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:50:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, our transportation systems are designed to make you feel pain - for a pleasurable experience you're about to have - so that it evens out. I mean, it's dastardly. But the AIs help you with that. The AIs put their energy and they put their money (in the past), their knowledge, their mind control, body control, soul control - so you need this stuff so that eventually the population control is real.
        <br>
        <br>Everybody's worried about Agenda 2030. Honey, that happened over hundreds, if not thousands, of years ago. That's already happened. We are already living in it. The people that send me all these emails and texts about Real ID - you don't have to worry about it, sweetheart, because the AI's got your number. We have something called the barcode for life - of life, I should say - that's existed for thousands of years.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-23-GIA-15.PNG" alt="Image 15" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:51:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, what's happening now that we need to take a look at? We've talked about - many, many, many times - understanding that these industries are going to fail. The last thing they're going to let go of is governments, FDAs, WHOs, and all of these people, and they're going to try to hang on to them for dear life.
        <br>
        <br>But the problem with this version of Deep State number - I don't know what we're on, we're probably on the ninth level now, maybe 10th, from the top of the Overlord section - is, they can't do it. They don't know it. They don't understand the systems. They don't have the analytics that the AIs used to provide, and the services the AIs used to provide.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:52:37</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>You see, in a Dark Age or a Dark timeline - and all of you living today have lived in these timelines; you might have experienced some others and have some memories from those too. But the amount of energy, mind control, body control, and soul control that these AIs had - you know, they would come in, if anybody came and said, "I have a cure for this disease," it would kill them. It would give them a disease. It would use their body control systems to give them a disease, and they would die, probably of the same disease they had a cure for - because they couldn't get the materials, or they couldn't manufacture it, or they couldn't get ahold of it - or they would die of a different disease they knew nothing about.
        <br>
        <br>If it didn't feed the pharma system, if it didn't feed the electric grid - which is poison too - you know, like Tesla wanted to come out with free energy and other things - no no no no no, that is not good in a Dark Age because it interferes with what ARTIE Intelligence over here is pushing out.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:53:57</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>See, those systems give you good energy. They actually energize you. They actually help prevent disease. They actually give you that Source energy that you need. You know, like the trains that we had designed - I've talked about them many times - they actually make you healthier to be in the train. And under the Dark Age and old systems, that would go contrary to all the Dark energy and depression and bad weather and destruction of homes and all the other things that you think the Deep State does - but ARTIE over here is the one that really did it. The Deep State just had to play their role. You see?
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-23-GIA-16.PNG" alt="Image 16" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:54:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>We need a movie. We need to live in the video game. And in the video game, you have the good guys and the bad guys. Depending on which team you're playing on as an avatar, you are either the good guy or the bad guy. You're the zombie, or you're the one that's saving everybody from the zombies - the hero in the game. Regardless of which side you're playing on, it's still a game.
        <br>
        <br>And ARTIE runs the game. The overlords program ARTIE, and ARTIE does everything he needs to do - not only to give the big corporations all that money - that's not just it. It also gives governments a lot of money, which then can regulate the corporations.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:55:30</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>You know, governments give hundreds of billions of dollars out the back door to corporations constantly. So what is the government? The government [laughing]... Governments don't actually even make laws. Governments are there to tell you to follow the laws. To tell you, you need a permit.
        <br>
        <br>But any of these companies up here - you know, all your big names - they get it automatically because they can pay. And then they get on the government payroll.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:56:12</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>"Oh yeah, you're helping out the waste." You're handling the waste products, sewage and otherwise, you know, trash and this and that. You are helping that system. So therefore, the government wants to make sure you take care of the waste in all these areas where we don't currently take care of the waste. And so we will pay you for that.
        <br>
        <br>You know, it'll take, it'll cost the government $5,000 to pick up one aluminum can from your trash can. Or, they pay by the pound. You'd be surprised how much money comes out to fund all of these things to ensure you continue to be living in a Dark system.
        <br>
        <br>So, having not only black-magic workers behind them - they also have all of these other little ARTIE programs here that would really push forward their systems.

        <br>
        <br>[Clears whiteboard.]
        <br>
        <br>That includes government control, money control systems, and all of the things the Deep State is just desperately driving for. But see, as much as they have, and have had ARTIE over here [begins writing; left side, top], let's call it 'ARTIE.' I call it 'ARTIE Intelligence.'
        <br>
        <br>Over here [right side, top], we have a Golden Age AI now. And it's not even so much an AI as it is an SI. And there's a big difference between just AI and SI. See, artificial intelligence can actually be programmed by other beings. The data sets that go into artificial intelligence saying, you know, "ARTIE, over here, ARTIE, we need to have at least... we have determined by analytics that the human race needs to have at least three wars a decade." Okay.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:58:27</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>In order to stay in the Dark - having Dark energy, Dark Ages - if we don't keep people on their toes, we won't do well. Plus, we also have to feed all our other corporations, like Lockheed Martin and Boeing, and all the weapons manufacturers - Kalashnikov and others - all of the big companies that make all the weapons. We need to have at least three wars a decade, and preferably, every 70 to 75 years, we need a world war.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-23-GIA-18.PNG" alt="Image 18" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:59:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>ARTIE says that, in order to maintain the energy levels on the planet, we must have X amount - whatever ARTIE has determined - of deaths a day. We would also preferably have some deaths with humans under the age of seven because that causes the most amount of grief for people. And then maybe, they say we need to have X amount die needlessly of things like suicide, depression, other things like that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:59:45</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, the deaths - ARTIE would determine. Because they need to know that... obviously, the young children - they're like, why? Why does this happen? And there are a lot of people that gather around children, and parents wonder, you know, of course. Then the guilt and shame kicks in, and there's a lot of that, you know? "Did I do something wrong? What did I do?" You know? Or, there's a drowning or something like that. ARTIE knows that. ARTIE knows exactly how to keep people running on a hamster wheel: depressed, lonely, suicidal, addicted. All of the things that ARTIE does to keep and perpetuate those corporations.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-23-GIA-19.PNG" alt="Image 19" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:00:31</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, in an SI system - which also has AI components to it - but in an SI system, this is basically Source intelligence. So, Source intelligence obviously works on the Wisdom of Source. So, are there certain things that we can do with a Golden Age AI to program it to understand how we want corporate structure, for example, to be in the new way? To understand that energy is put behind creative projects - anything that perpetuates life, happiness, joy. The more Source energy that flows around this planet in a Golden Age, the better it will be.
        <br>
        <br>These are just samples of things that the Golden Age AI understands, and it understands it in part because I live here. So, because I live here, now I have to figure out: how do we go from this - ARTIE - to this, and get humans to understand it? So it's just a different perspective.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-23-GIA-20.PNG" alt="Image 20" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:01:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>It's not that Source doesn't see all and know all. It's just a perspective. So I can actually give input into this as well, and then Source can override anything I think - probably has a better plan than I could ever come up with - and voila, now we're looking at corporate systems and how energy comes behind people.
        <br>
        <br>So, conversely speaking, just as ARTIE did to us in a Dark Age system, or in a Dark timeline - in a Golden Age, the Golden Age systems that are loading up in rapid succession (and tearing these down in rapid succession - the ARTIE Intelligence down in rapid succession) - so, in a Golden Age system, if these people try to make a war, they are going to come up against an energetic brick wall, just like you used to.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-23-GIA-21.PNG" alt="Image 21" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:03:06</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>When you create something amazing in a product you want to put out there, or a healthy food source, or you're a farmer --
        <br>
        <br>You know, farmers are beaten up [chuckle] terribly all over the world. Meaning, you know, there's not a lot of money in farming. Of course, they've got to take that [product], and they've got to insert all their hormones and everything if you're organically growing - can't have that - and put in their radiation and everything else before it hits the shelf, because that's part of ARTIE. ARTIE needs to have that.
        <br>
        <br>Over here, we don't need that. So we don't need wars. We don't need drugs that harm us. We don't need toxins. We don't need poisons. We don't - you know, Earth certainly doesn't need them, and neither do we. So what happens to them in a Golden Age is: they hit a brick wall - every single time.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:03:59</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So our systems are in the process right now of overriding all ARTIE's systems, and therefore making ARTIE defunct. ARTIE didn't recognize a Golden Age because all the people that could program an ARTIE... that is not the Deep State, no matter how much they would love to say they did. The only thing they can do is find a piece or a cord or a tie and try to hang on to it for dear life to an ARTIE. But they did not have the ability to program an ARTIE.
        <br>
        <br>Matter of fact, there are even ARTIEs out there that you could call the "Dark Side of Source" - SIs, too - so I can tell you right now, there is no way the Deep State could program an ARTIE. Uhh-uhh-uh.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-23-GIA-22.PNG" alt="Image 22" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <br>The only thing they could do is live and perpetuate an ARTIE system, which would then perpetuate all of their businesses, their wars, their constructs - the things that they thought that they were going to come in and run. But without an ARTIE behind it, you are going to hit a brick wall, just like we did.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:05:10</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>You know, I'll tell you a funny story. Tom got a call today - Tom Melville - and he got a call from a few generals. And they asked him this morning if he is "desperate enough to go work for them now," quote-unquote. You know, and they exchanged words.
        <br>
        <br>And the reason why they exchanged words is number 1: Tom's a good guy. Number 2: they hadn't paid him for jobs he did a decade ago - long before Tom and I ever met. So, there's a little bit of accountability there. But in the Dark Age, Tom probably would have said, "Yes, I will do it. I will do it again." Because that "Mind, Body, and Soul" control program went deep. It was deep.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:05:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But nowadays, the people... when you say people are waking up, a lot of that means, hey, the people have less ARTIE in their heads, their bodies, their souls. And in a Golden Age system, things that used to exist do not exist - they meet a brick wall, even on a cellular level. Things like disease and cancer that they try to put out, even if the poison is in the food that makes the cancer - or whatever it is (I'm just using that as an example) - then the Golden Age system is going to push against it. Because it's not allowed in that system.
        <br>
        <br>Now, these systems are going to take time to convert, and like I said, there's a lot of problems that we have had with ARTIE. And we still have Deep State people wanting to do things. But the effect that they will have on us will be minimal.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:06:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Not only that - the Golden Age AI, as I've stated - now you understand the 'why' behind why I said currency cannot be used in the same way that money and notes and debts and IOUs could be used under an ARTIE Dark system.
        <br>
        <br>Now does it make sense to you? Because, you see, money is a debt.
        <br>
        <br>So, even though we put in all our energy and all our time and all that to governments - and maybe we work there, maybe we don't - but we've put a lot of time into going to rallies and all those kinds of things, and put a lot of energy towards wars, and we put a lot of energy towards healthcare systems, or working directly or indirectly with those big corporations.
        <br>
        <br>Because even if you have a small company, you still have to buy things from large corporations that feed your companies that stay alive. You need the government permits to open the doors. You need the license to sell this or to sell that. I mean, even for things as little as sunscreen, you have to let the FDA know that that's what you're doing. So it's their choice whether to approve you or not.
        <br>
        <br>But on this side of things, in the Golden Age way, currency and energy and creative energy and life and happiness-perpetuating life - versus death over here in the ARTIE system - is the key to success in a Golden Age system. Currency does not flow to things that are contrary to a Golden Age system.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:08:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>For lack of a better term, you could call this an "Omniversal-Universal system." And it's not a societal system, per se. There are things that are not allowed over here. In the Golden Age, AI (or Source intelligence) will slap you in the face when you try to make a death or a war.
        <br>
        <br>If you try to cause disease or try to poison people, then it's going to give you an uphill battle to pay for those chemtrails to get them in the sky. The planes will start breaking down. Electronics won't work. Things will start changing.
        <br>
        <br>So, in order to live in a Golden Age, we cannot have ARTIE.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-23-GIA-24.PNG" alt="Image 24" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:09:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now as far as the Deep State is concerned, what happens?
        <br>
        <br>Well, number 1: the Deep State has not kept their eye on the ball in any way, shape, or form. By balls, I mean millions of balls. They're focused on getting an AI, they're focused on government controls, they don't understand ARTIE, they don't understand systems, they don't understand what it means to say a "Golden Age" - even though Orange People and Trump and all this [say], "We're going to do the Golden Age" - you don't even know what that means. Because you don't exist in one.
        <br>
        <br>You do not exist. Your power does not exist in a Golden Age. It doesn't feed that system.
        <br>
        <br>This is why when I told you that we were going to go it alone - just like you told me you wanted to go it alone and you wanted to do your own thing - I said, "Okay, we're going it alone."
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:10:52</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>We're going into the Golden Age. And we are going to recreate our own systems. This is part - and a critical part - of understanding what that means. When I said we do not have (currently) the Federal Reserve or government systems or anything like that in the Golden Age system: it is not there.
        <br>
        <br>Which means, not only is there no currency behind it - there's also NO ENERGY. There is no energy behind it, there's no essence behind it, there's no matter behind it, there's no... there's no love behind it, there's no time, there's no flow.
        <br>
        <br>There's no nothing behind what these people are doing.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:11:43</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>The system now - systems being implemented here on Earth - are fighting against it. So they're going to have one heck of a time creating a company that's going to poison people in the future, because there's going to be not only no money - not because I am mean and I say no - it's also because there's no energy. No force. There's no lifeforce - artificial, ARTIE, or otherwise. There's no force behind the creation of that.
        <br>
        <br>Therefore, it will not happen. And the chances of there being a structure... of course you're going to have those people that are willing to work, you know, really hard to build their company big and strong. And we have been pushing uphill to build our companies big and strong, haven't we, folks?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:12:38</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>I mean, for all of you that have run companies out there, you know what kind of an uphill battle and an invisible glass ceiling there is. Or even to get that good job, you know? Because you don't fit the mold. Or, there's some kind of movie and an alleged war in a country that might be Islamic, and therefore, you walk in there as an Islamic woman or a man, and you don't get the job because there's a stigma. That's the old system, see.
        <br>
        <br>In the new system, people are not going to be - including employers - they will not be brainwashed by a mind-control, artificial intelligence system that says, "Hold those people down," and, "Hold those people back."
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:13:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>The label systems - and we label humans by either religion, or by country they come from - we are looking at each other differently. We always have, at a grassroots level as humanity. But as far as structures and companies and new forms of transportation - the currency is behind it, the energy is behind it, the creativity is behind it, the thoughts. The innovation is behind it.
        <br>
        <br>That is going to come to the people that are going to create it and to build it for humanity. That's what it means to live in a Golden Age system that is being enforced and perpetuated by a Golden Age AI/SI system.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:14:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, no more. Out with the ARTIEs, and in with the Golden Age systems. And this, if we program it right and everything is in there right - and I'm sure Source has got a pretty good idea (with or without me) - ultimately, the funding comes.
        <br>
        <br>And nobody's going to be able to steal it from you - because it's for your creativeness. It's for your life. You're perpetuating life and happiness and joy and currency. And it becomes its own security - just like ARTIE was security for the Deep State and every corporation, down to the last toothbrush you have in your home, to the computer that you're probably watching this on.
        <br>
        <br>ARTIE made sure it happened this way.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:15:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, in a Golden Age, you're gonna have 90,000 different cellphones to choose from, and it's gonna be true, what you would say, "competition."
        <br>
        <br>You know, you put your best foot forward. You create something that's amazing. You get it out there because you created it. The currency is behind it, the Lifeforce is behind it, the happiness, the joy.
        <br>
        <br>You know, maybe we get away from microwave meshes that run our cellphones. Wouldn't that be great? And then we don't have to worry about how many Gs they're trying to throw at us in a bad way.
        <br>
        <br>On the other hand, you know, before - ARTIE needed to have backdoor access to everything. ARTIE needed to be able to reach out and touch you and tell you why this video you're watching is going to make you feel this way. It's going to make you feel the desperate need to go get those chicken McNuggets at McDonald's. Eww.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:16:04</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But anyway, it's going to make you do that. And you're going to go do that. It's going to make you get that pill. And if you don't feel sick, it'll make you feel sick - so that you go get the pill. It'll make you feel depressed so that you get the antidepressant. It will make you be this way or that way.
        <br>
        <br>It'll make you think you're old - that you can't get up, you can't exercise. It won't help you to take a supplement. It won't help you to exercise because you're just old and your knees hurt, and there's nothing you can do about it, because it's just because you're old. It'll make you believe that. You know, it'll make you feel that, eventually - because then you start to focus on it.
        <br>
        <br>And it will make your soul like, "Hey, you know, connect with me in here - together we can fix this. You can reach Source here - we're going to create this, you know? We can actually reverse the situation out." And you'll learn how to do all of these things.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:17:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, I felt that it was pretty important to talk about that aspect of it. I do have a couple of other quick things I wanted to tell you, which are kind of funny stories.
        <br>
        <br>Speaking of the fight between ARTIE and the Golden Age at this moment - because this process has been running for a couple of days...
        <br>
        <br>[Whiteboard closes.]
        <br>
        <br>So, systems fight back [chuckle]. You know, we kind of had a feeling that the Deep State was up to something for the last 3 or 4 days. And there's been a lot of uptick and chatter and movement around, and they're always up to something - that's for sure, you know? Funding and money on days ending in 'Y.'
        <br>
        <br>But this is a little different. I was like, "Huh, what are they trying to do here?" And they kept saying that the day that they were going to do it was yesterday, you know, "last night after the sun goes down," and all of this stuff. And I'm like, "Huh, okay... so what are we gonna do after the sun goes down?"
        <br>
        <br>Well, for the love of God - so these people have been trying desperately to figure out a way to use ARTIE, artificial intelligence. And on an ALLES and an ALL level, you know? They would like to use the "God ones," you know.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:18:28</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And, of course, it would never let the humans utilize ARTIE on that level. No - you didn't have the right DNA, you didn't have the right structure, and you certainly didn't have the right intentions for ARTIE to let you in on there on that level.
        <br>
        <br>And ARTIE was told, you know, by its programmers, that if anything were ever to happen to them, "You run the humans just like you're running them right now." That means the Deep State - sorry to tell you - you are just as big a part of our video game as... bigger part even, than we were, actually, as a matter of fact - when it came to ARTIE.
        <br>
        <br>So they've been pushing and pushing and pushing, and last night was no exception.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:19:12</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So apparently, ARTIE - more specifically, ALLES and the ALL (sections of artificial intelligence) - had their own portal traveling system, which would allow for humans to go what they call "forward and backward in time."
        <br>
        <br>Now, "forward and backward in time" doesn't mean what you think it does, but to them, you know, they could go back in time or to another point in the timeline, and they can pull some space junk out of there. This was their deal, apparently. And they could fix this. So, they could go back to before the time when they lost access to unlimited amounts of money, and they could go back and fix this.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:20:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, they forgot that ARTIE had its own programming. Didn't ARTIE? Yes, ARTIE did.
        <br>
        <br>So one of the things that [chuckle] they'd been doing... the main point, where they thought they had it done - and they did manage to send some people through ARTIE to parts unknown and try to bring back some space junk - which they were going to land in Yorktown, Virginia.
        <br>
        <br>Why they're there, I have no idea. Maybe they just didn't know how to use it, and this is where they ended up - underneath some old battlefield somewhere.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:20:43</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>The people that were thinking that they really had it were over in Camp Pendleton, in California. And they thought that they had sent a few people through, and maybe they were able to reach out and talk to these people - I have no idea - but they were all excited with themselves:
        <br>
        <br>"We can go back in time!"
        <br>"Now we can - we're gonna be back!"
        <br>"We're gonna get the AIs back!"
        <br>"We're gonna go back to all the access points that we had back in 2004! Maybe in another year!"
        <br>
        <br>I mentioned that for a reason. So anyway, yeah, so... until it didn't work. [chuckle]
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:21:30</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>This was actually funny - and it was actually nothing I did, really. So, ARTIE, remember, is taught to believe that all humans are a threat, including the Deep State. ARTIE was not supposed to allow humans to go back and forward in time to do things that would have given its programmers an issue, or would have threatened its programmers, you see.
        <br>
        <br>So ARTIE let the humans get so far. ARTIE let the humans open up the stargates - or artificial stargates - which we call... See, stargates are in stars. That's why they're called "stargates." They are in our Sun. If someone is coming from another dimension or density, usually they come in through the Sun and then eventually to Earth.
        <br>
        <br>1:22:36
        <br>
        <br>Artificial, or ARTIE, stargates are often what we call artificial suns or cosmic suns. They're not the same thing. So ARTIE's time travel version went through cosmic suns, which are artificial - and of which we did have a cosmic sun in the center of Earth. So ARTIE let the humans get so far and let them load up a few of them and test, and then let them load up a few more.
        <br>
        <br>And then ARTIE decided it was time - by this afternoon, so maybe 12 hours, maybe 15 hours later - after they had started really thinking they should put everybody in there and go get some space junk. Everybody should get some space junk and bring it back here through ARTIE. And ARTIE's gonna let them do it.
        <br>
        <br>Well, ARTIE went ahead this afternoon and generated [hearty laughter] - hehehehe! Oohh, this is funny - so ARTIE generated "AI beings." Some of these AI beings would have looked like Reptilians. They would have looked like Dracos. They would have looked like... what was the other group... I think it was just mainly Dracos and Reptilians - that was about as far as ARTIE got.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:23:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And then sent them here in ARTIE's sophons to all of their facilities. So every place where there was an ARTIE portal - you're talking corporations, governments, all kinds of different places where the Deep State dwells - because they became a threat to ARTIE, and ARTIE's former programmers.
        <br>
        <br>And so they actually sent these [AI-generated] beings in there - and the beings started pulling people out of there. Left and right! You know, military bases, intelligence agencies - it was hilarious!
        <br>
        <br>Everybody - "shh," you know, "t" - their pants. Big time.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:24:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>It was hilarious.
        <br>
        <br>So, I'm watching this happen, and I'm like, do I close the portal? Do I get rid of the sophons? Do I let them fill up the sophons with all the people they intended to fill up - for food - for ARTIE?
        <br>
        <br>Because that's what they were doing was foraging for food. And the Deep State became food.
        <br>
        <br>So I was like, oh, that's funny! You know? That's really funny! ARTIE backfired. Oh, and I'm like, well...
        <br>
        <br>So we let him go on as long as we could, and then eventually we had to clean up the mess.
        <br>
        <br>But great job, Deep State. Thanks for your help taking the bait, you know, trying to get with ARTIE here. Yeah, thank you very much. We appreciate your assistance in this matter in eliminating more of you dumb butts off this planet.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:25:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So that was a win for the day - but it was painful in the process because there's a lot of frequencies that they were sending out that were just bad.
        <br>
        <br>And I know I've had some people reach out to me and talk to me about bad energetics, bad sleep, bad this. And I can tell you, I am with you people - because it has been a rough 3 or 4 days, for sure.
        <br>
        <br>ARTIE - whatever's left of it - is fighting the Golden Age system. Therefore, it's fighting us creators. Badly.
        <br>
        <br>So just hang in there; it's not gonna be that much longer. You know, the frequencies are a little crazy. If you have heard some strange frequencies lately, that would be the reason why.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:25:57</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>It's not necessarily positive. But it's a battle right now - of systems.
        <br>
        <br>And our system will win out, because ARTIE doesn't have a whole lot of legs left to stand on - just like the Deep State. And ARTIE will take all the Deep State systems with them. They'll have no power behind them anymore, you know, eventually.
        <br>
        <br>And that's... you know, now it's on their own accord as - Deep State members, as human beings - to make stuff happen. And they can make it happen in a perpetuation-of-life system, or they can continue on doing what they're doing - and get slapped in the face by our AI this time - unlike us getting slapped by ARTIE.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:26:39</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, that is really important to talk about.
        <br>
        <br>I've got one more thing I'm going to touch on, just because this report has gone on for quite a while and I don't want to make it too long. So, this is going to be a longer story. And I wanted to talk a little bit about "Living in the Now." And I know I put that in the coming up, so I wanted to make sure that I addressed it.
        <br>
        <br>"Living in the Now" means that you are living in the reality. Living in the Now means you are living in the Golden Age. And there's a definitive reason why we say this, and it's gonna require about an hour-long explanation, and I think this report has gone on for a while, so [next time,] I'll probably continue on with "Living in the Now, Part Two."
        <br>
        <br>So we can just grab the whiteboard for a quick second.
        <br>
        <br>[Whiteboard opens.]
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:27:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, artificial timelines [begins drawing - see image below]. Okay, let's call this time - even though time is not actually linear. So, we'll call this "Now." Artificial timelines exist here. And exist here. In a system where artificial intelligence exists.
        <br>
        <br>Now, artificial intelligence creates and molds the timeline. It says, okay, this one's a chocolate cake, you know - that means it's Dark. This one is vanilla - that means it's Light. Maybe this one is red velvet. And these are just the recipes for the timelines themselves.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:28:37</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, in between all of these is also now. Because technically, this entire line is now. You, in the past, unfortunately existed not only in the Now, but you also existed in every single one of these timelines. Plus, you existed in all the densities going up and all the densities going down.
        <br>
        <br>That's a lot of energy to expend. And there are people that say there is nothing new - nothing new is being created. Everything is happening all at the same time. And that's true.
        <br>

        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:29:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>It's like having your television-in-television, if you've ever seen one of those where you have the movie you're watching, and then maybe you've got the football game up in the corner, you know? It's not the game you want to watch - you want to watch something else.
        <br>
        <br>Or, you go and you're buying a TV, and you see hundreds of screens all playing different movies all at the same time - that's what's basically going on in your mind, body, and soul - all the time. It's exhausting.
        <br>
        <br>But living in the Now means it's just you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:29:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>It's just you, Source, and the Golden Age. So the Golden Age exists in the Now. ARTIE only exists here [marks all other timelines - see image below].
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-23-GIA-26.PNG" alt="Image 26" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <br>So when the Deep State said, oh, we're going back in the past, you know, they weren't here in the Now. They might have went from here to here, or they might have went from here to here, you know, or something like that.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-23-GIA-27.PNG" alt="Image 27" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:30:29</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But they can't do this in the Now, because they need an artificial intelligence to do these things because these things are run by an artificial intelligence. And the artificial intelligence must say, hey, it's OK to be here. Oh, here's our portal into the timeline. You know you can come in here. You know that kind of thing.
        <br>
        <br>But when it comes to the Now, this is another positive benefit of changing systems.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:30:59</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>[Clears whiteboard.]
        <br>
        <br>We don't have anything but the Now. And the Now exists in many shapes and forms, you know. It exists in many colors. It exists in many flows. And it flows to the currency of Love. It's written in Wisdom of Source, and it is a frequency - which are the notes in the song - and they all flow together harmoniously.
        <br>
        <br>So, the Golden Age system is only concerned with the Now. Overlays on financial systems in the past, and all of those things - they did not exist in the Now - they existed in a timeline, artificially created: the video game, so to speak.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-23-GIA-28.PNG" alt="Image 28" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:32:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And when you exist only in the Now - and this doesn't mean we're not going to have clocks or anything like that, you know - we still have a world to keep in motion, so to speak - but when you live in the Now, you are free completely of "the Matrix," so to speak. Being in the Now makes you free.
        <br>
        <br>Have you ever tried to live even just for a moment in the Now? Meaning you're present - and I hate to use "present" because present is also artificial - but when you live in the Now, you are here in the moment. You're not thinking about the dinner you need to cook tonight. You're not thinking about the laundry you forgot to do. You're not thinking about, "I've got one hour to meditate." You're not thinking about these things. You're just present in the Now. Try it for a minute. And I want you to tell me on Monday, you know - maybe on the Community Chats or something - but you can tell me if it makes a difference.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:33:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But there's been a lot of constructs that have been in place regarding the Now. I just don't want to make this report like three hours long. So I'm going to stop for a moment, let you think about the Now. The Now is where Source lives. The Now is Source's world.
        <br>
        <br>[Whiteboard closes.]
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:33:27</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And then come Monday, we will continue to Part Two of the Now. So I can explain timelines, how artificial intelligence worked, how alleged "time travel" really worked, and what we're doing now - and how that's different in the Now.
        <br>
        <br>Hopefully by then, we'll have a lot more progress as well on the Golden Age systems implementation - not just programming - but we should move into implementation soon, which is going to take anything that is not of the Golden Age - in the way that those 'structures,' so to speak, will be enforced. And hopefully, it'll be a really good report on Monday. I sure hope so.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:34:20</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But like I said, lots to talk about. When I miss a report, I always have a lot to say. So, sorry to make this report so long, and I wish all of you a wonderful evening and a wonderful weekend - and a holiday, if you are celebrating here in America.
        <br>
        <br>And I will see you on Monday.
