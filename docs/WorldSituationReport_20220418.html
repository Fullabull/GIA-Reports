        <br>
        <br>Sunny: Hi everyone, and welcome to a special news report. I'm Sunny Gault with United Network News, and we have an update for you all. So let's go ahead and bring our very own Kimberly Goguen on. And Kim, I know a lot's been going on - a lot is always going on. But last time we chatted with everyone, we gave them the news that we're now on the positive timeline that Source intended for us to be on. So let's kind of pick things up and give them an update of what's been going on in April.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:00:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: A lot has been going on in April. What hasn't been going on in April? So everybody's been talking about how their energy feels off - one day it's great, the next day it's terrible. Today's a little bit different story, so I'll just touch on that real quick.
        <br>
        <br>Kim: We had a major backlash from, I guess you would say, the Dark Side of the Multiverse. And they've been throwing the book at us today. So if you're feeling a little bit off - a little dizzy, a little headaches - again, there was an issue at Oak Ridge Laboratories under Tennessee (it's under Nashville) and they had fired up a computer system called Summit, which was connecting to a lot of graphics cards and GPS systems through your phone and through your computer.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:01:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So if you've been on the computer a lot more than normal today, or your normal Monday computer activities, or you're working, that is why you're experiencing some issues. The matter should be resolved; just was resolved maybe about half an hour, an hour ago - and just in time for this broadcast - so you can get back on your computer now. No, I wanted to make sure you saw us! [Laughing.] So yeah, so that was today's issues.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:02:08</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: We've also had a lot of shakeups in the Multiverse because of all of the changes. So I wanted to touch base, and just let you know kind of how this all worked - what the Matrix really, I guess you would say, almost was - because it's almost gone now - and just give you a basic understanding of energetically where we're at now, and what we can expect in the near future, and how this will affect you.
        <br>
        <br>So, Sunny have you been feeling okay today?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:02:39</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: Today yes, but over the weekend. I felt very lethargic and I basically just took a break from the computer. Usually I'm still doing stuff, working and doing stuff on the computer, but I've learned to listen to my body. So today for me has been better, but over the weekend I was like, I couldn't even look at a computer. So that's what I was gonna ask you - could it have started earlier than today? Like when did this whole thing start with the computers and chips?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:03:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Yesterday wasn't... it was lethargic, but today people are reporting like blurry vision, headaches, lots of stuff like that. So there was a lot of lethargy yesterday.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:03:21</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: And I had that; I had that, definitely.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:03:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Yeah. Every day is a new adventure, so we never know what's going to happen. Yesterday's was more due to - and I'm going to go off the little bullet points I gave you, so I'm sorry - but yesterday was more due to a group called the ACIO, which is either Alien Contact Intelligence, they are... and then sometimes they say like Advanced Contact. They do not work for any agency. And they do not work for - uh-oh, I'm freezing now, is that better? Okay, there we go - so, they do not work for any agency, they work with agencies and militaries, or used to. And they are very, very advanced.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:04:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So they started to detect the Metatron's Cube structure (that I'll explain to you here in a minute) - that was around Earth and throughout the Multiverse - was starting to fade. And they became concerned. So they started to fire up a - I'm not gonna get into the physics aspect of it - but, a machine, in order to protect that cube. So we reached out to them, we told them that it's not necessary for that to be there anymore. It has been replaced; do your research. You don't need to work with the militaries, you don't need to work with the agencies anymore. And they went ahead and checked the archives, Hall of Records, the information, the Tesseract to make sure everything was secure - we weren't going to all evaporate - and everything was good.
        <br>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:05:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So that was yesterday's adventure, earlier in the morning. Like I said, it's been a crazy time. So it took probably, I don't know, 3 or 4 hours of clearing what they had put out. So most people are saying, you know, you still were tired throughout the night, till you went to bed. But most of it was cleared up probably earlier in the morning; just took a little bit of time.
        <br>
        <br>So yeah so that was yesterday's. Any other days you want to talk about? What do you think people need to know about?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:05:39</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: So, I mean, are those good guys, quote, unquote, or bad guys? I mean, you said that they were kind of protecting what was going on here - they weren't up to speed. I don't know where to rank them though.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:05:49</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: They are human in part, they are more transhuman. They were neutral, I would say. They were here to protect the agreements that were in place. And they had been unaware that a lot of those agreements had changed, and they were still going through the motions. I do believe that some of the information they're getting from us (what we're doing every day) is getting back to some of the generals and whatnot - and they had not realized it either, until yesterday in the afternoon, that Metatron's Cube was just about gone.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:06:30</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So it's caused even more of a disruption today - this is the backlash that I was talking about. This isn't really coming from the Deep State, this is just a matter of how things work. So, when a species is under threat and is dying, what happens is they're gonna run, right? They're gonna run to the nearest safe place. And a lot of them ran here today - and I think we're pretty well cleared from that now, but it was pretty rough a little bit ago.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:07:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So lots of... what do you want to say, infestations types of things, trying to use some gates in the corona of the Sun to access Earth. But, we're on it - we're watching everything. So we're gonna be okay. We're gonna make it to the 24th. The timeline is secure, nothing has changed there. This is just the dying of an animal that has existed for millions of years, literally.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:07:35</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: And which animal is that? Like, who are we referring to right now?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:07:40</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: The creatures that managed to - or beings, I should say - that managed to escape from the Dark Side of the Multiverse (or what you would call Hell), over to the Light Side of Multiverse. So that's why like one minute you're like "Yay I have all the energy in the world!" And then, 10 minutes later, you're like "Oh, where did that go?!" And then headaches, blurry vision, different things.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:08:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: But all of this ties to all the things that are going on. Like, earlier this morning you wake up and you're like yay, you know, I'm doing great - and you might even feel a little bit tingly and light, and that's because today was our second pulse from the Central Sun. Not our Sun, but the Central Sun, which is what you would call, like, Source-direct, right? We got a God-direct pulse - because it takes about, it happens about every three and a half to four days. So this was our second one, and this one was a lot stronger. And I'll explain to you why it was stronger this time than it was.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:08:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: I know in one of our special reports we talked about the Gegenschein, right? Okay, so let's talk about our Big Blue Ball. [Begins drawing on whiteboard.] I don't know if I got a thing [an eraser] - I got a new whiteboard, guys.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:09:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: I see that. Kim's going to the whiteboard - here we go!
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:09:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: I know. I'm excited about it. Well the other one kind of crashed. We took it somewhere to go to a meeting and it kind of didn't survive the trip. So it was time to get a new one.
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Okay, so if this is Earth [center of whiteboard], and then you would have our Sun [far right] - this is obviously not to scale. I'm running out of room here. And then you would have the Central Sun [upper right]. This is very large actually, and this is like pure Source Energy. This is what you would be calling a Nine Energy; a complete energy source. There's nothing there except for all that condensed Light - it's like almost a solid object at that point when you get there. And we'll go over how that kind of works.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:10:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So here [between Earth and Central Sun], we had what's called a nebulus. So a nebulus is like a cloud in space. Let's call it debris from the past - and we'll talk about that another time because we don't have enough time today to do that - but this [nebulus] is a compilation of certain type of metals that are a superconductor of this Source Light energy.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:10:31</small></small>

        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:10:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So, what we had done, when we said that we amped up the Gegenschein is, we took this connection [Earth <- nebulus -> Central Sun], when it wasn't fully in alignment yet, and we took what we had from there, and then it [Source Light coming through the nebulus] made like a little light in this particular area of Earth [circled - see image below].
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2022-04-18-WSR-02.PNG" alt="Image 02" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:10:52</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>It would have gone from like, Russia on the high end - which is kind of the "gate to heaven," where one of the gates to heaven is - and then it would have been somewhere around Greece - it was very small in the very beginning. And then we extended it through the center of the Earth. So we now made that kind of direct connection.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2022-04-18-WSR-03.PNG" alt="Image 03" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:11:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: But what's happening right now...
        <br>
        <br>[Erases whiteboard.]
        <br>
        <br>Oh, it [the eraser] works! First time - the first time - it worked! [appreciative smile] Okay, so I'm going to redraw this real quick - Central Sun and Earth. So what's happening now - and our Gegenschein is back - is these [Earth <- nebulus -> Central Sun] are almost in direct alignment, but not quite yet. So we're probably as of today, you know, getting like this.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2022-04-18-WSR-04.PNG" alt="Image 04" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:12:04</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So we're at like maybe 54, 55 percent. And on the 24th this alignment is perfect, so we'll be getting 100 percent, like, a big slam of Source into the planet - which is going to be fantastic for some, and for some not so much so. So this is why we said, we may see a lot of the Deep State people - the deep, deep, Deep State, let's put it that way; the ones that are probably not human anymore and possessed by something or other - go away. So when you say, "Earth might go through a cleansing," yeah - it might go through a cleansing. But this is how it happened. So laying all that out there for you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:12:49</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Now, normally, if this alignment were to happen with the Gegenschein reactivated, it would be too much for us in the Third Dimension - if this was direct. Now the thing that would have always prevented this from really being what it is now would be a Metatron's Cube type structure, which existed in the Multiverse.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:13:18</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: [Clears whiteboard.]
        <br>
        <br>So let me kind of show you what that is. And this is a multi-dimensional, multi-density "energy binder," let's call it. All right. So, the energy from the Sun is also Source energy - although in the past it was synthetically put there - they had put power packs in the Sun, and you had to buy the loosh to make your sun work, right? I know.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:13:54</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: Yeah, it reminds me of like solar panels on a house or something, right?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:13:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So I'm going to draw this as linear, although we know things in the Multiverse are not linear. But just to give you a general idea. So you are here, okay, Earth. Earth exists in the Third Density. So we're very dense, we're solid creatures. And then you would go up to the Fourth. And then there would also be an equal and opposite Fourth down here. And then you would have a Fifth, you'd have Sixth, and Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2022-04-18-WSR-05.PNG" alt="Image 05" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:14:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: I went off my line. Okay. So Ninth, going this direction [up], would be pure dense Source. Like, only the Light can exist. So you couldn't go there in your physical person and still have a physical person - because you'd have no density. So the further you get away from here [Third Density], the beings are less and less dense.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:15:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So for example, like in the Eight Density, that's where the Arcturians live and they're pure Blue Light. I mean, they are healers of the Multiverse. And they can travel to other densities, but it's usually aided with technology, and they really hate our frequency but they'll come if they need to kind of thing [chuckle].
        <br>
        <br>Now, when you go down [below Earth], you have the same thing all the way till you get to Level 9 down here. Now, Nine down here (obviously I can count this is incorrect and I get that)...
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2022-04-18-WSR-06.PNG" alt="Image 06" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:15:48</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Okay, so, when you get to the Ninth down here, you have absolute Darkness. Like, the Nothingness. Nothing exists there. There is no people down there. There's no demons down there. There's NOTHING there.
        <br>
        <br>So you don't start getting into creatures on this [lower] side of the Multiverse until... I mean, you do have some Eighth Dimensional beings, such as like the Tarzakians, the Targetians and whatnot that exist there. But they're like... where the Arcturians are pure Light, the Targetians or Tarzakians (could have called both), are pure smoke. They look like smoky beings, like shadows. And they have red eyes, and you often see them kind of floating around if they're around you (like certain people I've seen recently, let's just say that). But yeah, you can see them, but they're not dense in any way. So we're talking densities here, right?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:16:52</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: And can they enter somebody's body, Kim? The ones that are down there, can they inhabit someone?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:16:59</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Sure. Yep, they'll do a swap. So your soul goes here [down]. You know, usually somewhere in this region [between Lower Fourth and Eighth] and then they get to go up, like to Earth. And that's how it works. And so, when I said that they (the deepest of the Deep State) were injecting themselves with something to make them good little hosts, that's what I meant.
        <br>
        <br>So now they're good little hosts for these beings that are not going to come. That's okay. So that's why I think it's going to backfire. That's my personal opinion. Whether it's on the news or not, who knows? We'll see. Okay, so this [diagram - see image below] is how density works in the Multiverse.

        <small><br><small>00:17:45</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Now people, you know, I always say humans are real real special, right? And Earth is very special - I'm gonna move Earth over here to the middle - because Earth actually has three densities. And we have three, two, and one, okay [writes labels "2" and "1" near Earth].

        <br>
        <br>So in order to have what you call a harmonious universe, you would have to... and this is why they talk about people with different strands of DNA and whatnot, right? So, some people, like if you're talking to... you know, you're meditating and you're having conversations with Others in other places, you would have a conversation with one that matches yours. So in order to have a harmonious - well not all the time because the Deep State does very good down here [Lower Astral], I can tell you that right now - and up here [Upper Astral], but you just don't know where you are and why it happened and what's happened.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:18:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So here [Earth] we have [encircles labels "2" and "1"]... in order to have a harmonious universe, okay, the reason why Earth is so different and humans are so special is because, okay, let's just say you have this [Third Density] particular type of DNA. Then you would be in alignment with the people at the Sixth Density - three plus six is nine. Okay. And this is what had to be recreated, and is being recreated right now, for us.
        <br>

        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:19:28</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So people talk about Terra. "Terra was Earth, Terra was Earth." No. It really wasn't, because it existed in the Second Density. It did not exist in the Third Density. The wars on Atlantis did not happen here [Earth]. It happened here [Terra]. That's what happened there - Midgard, right?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:19:49</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: Yeah.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:19:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Okay. So if you had this type of DNA [circling First Density], then you would be very comfortable having a conversation with the [Eighth Density] Arcturians. Now, some people have DNA from all three, right? So when I say, like, people have always asked me, "What does it mean that your DNA is closest to Source? What does that mean?" Well, that means that I have all three, so I can go anywhere.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:20:18</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: Oh, okay. Well, how would one know what they have Kim? Or is that like the million dollar question?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:20:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Well, hopefully in the near future, we will all go back there. But before we can do a restoration of humanity - which is what we need to do - we firstly have to get rid of the mess that's here. Then we can start doing some DNA repair. We need proper food. We need proper water. It's not something that is stagnant. You have living DNA too that changes with everything you eat, drink, take, it changes every single second every place you've ever stepped in your life changes your living DNA. And that's one thing that they've never figured out how to do, was how to clone that process. There's a reason for that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:21:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: Are you talking about the Deep State, Kim, when you say that?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:21:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Yeah. Now, now when I say one, two, and three - this is not a contest, right? It doesn't matter which one you currently have. It doesn't mean like one is better than three or two is better than three or whatever. They're all just different, that's all. Different versions of, I would say, remnants of what we were in the past. Okay. But this also has to do with different types of travel.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:21:34</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So, okay. So when we're done with this process, we will go back to being a harmonious Multiverse. So when you say "Oh, is help coming? Where is the help?" Where is this, where is that? I mean, yes, people can travel. They're much more advanced than the rest of us, you know - they can travel up and down and wherever they want to go. Most people do not cross this line [3rd Density/Earth] - the Enforcer won't cross that line. Most of these folks up here [4th and above] will not cross that line down there [3rd Density/Earth].
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:22:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: But When we became a nexus planet - meaning the only planet left in the Third Density that could... we were like the linchpin, essentially. Which meant, if we go, then this doesn't exist anymore [erases 3rd Density line] - and this [all Lower Astral densities] would have invaded everywhere.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:22:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: Oh, geez.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:22:39</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: And that's what we were trying to avoid. So when they talk about timelines and negative timelines and positive timelines - this is what I meant. Now, they thought - best-case scenario - they could pull Earth from here [Third Density]... You know, if I hear one more person saying that we want to go to the Fifth Density or the Sixth Density or 555 something or other - it's ridiculous. Because where they were trying to pull us - the very same people they're talking to are trying to pull us down here [Lower Astral, Fifth Density]. So then, that becomes the dividing line, right? And then all this [Upper Astral, Fourth Density and above] is infected by everything that's up [down!] here.
        <br>

        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:23:17</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: See? (Sunny: Yeah.) So, for our protection in the past we've had two different things. We had a Multiverse Metatron's Cube.
        <br>
        <br>[Clears whiteboard.]
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So I'll kind of show you, and I'm obviously excellent at drawing on a whiteboard but at least you'll have a better understanding.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:23:43</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: Kim, is there a way to distinguish when someone says Fifth Density or whatever, is there a way to distinguish whether they're talking about going up or going down? Because I hear that too and I'm always like, which way are you going? What are we talking about here?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:23:56</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Well, and we wouldn't go to a Fifth Density up. (Sunny: We wouldn't, yeah right.) No, no, we wouldn't. No, not at all. Because a three and a five don't make any sense. A five - that's not a harmonious Multiverse. So a three and a five don't make sense... a five and a one makes a six, you know... I guess...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:24:26</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Okay. So let's show you how this all happened and how we kind of became a mess.
        <br>
        <br>[Begins drawing.]
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So all of you have seen this before, right? Most of you that have been doing research for years and years and years know what this is. It is equilateral. I did not draw that properly though. And then of course we've all seen this one before, right? Okay.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2022-04-18-WSR-11.PNG" alt="Image 11" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:25:10</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Now this was installed on Earth because of the issues with the Destroyer we've talked about in the past - the Ultimate Black Magician - and the problems with infiltration from the Dark Side of the Multiverse to the Light Side of the Multiverse. And so here [draws line across cube] you would have had that line of demarcation, with us right here [small circle, center of line]. And now you can understand at least a little bit - and I don't want to go into too much detail. So when they say the Dark timeline, you can see the structure here would have allowed, this was Fifth Density [top center] - anchored by the Abraxas, thank you very much. Fourth [line from 10 to 2 o'clock] and Fourth Lower [8 to 4 o'clock] and Seventh [6 o'clock].
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2022-04-18-WSR-12.PNG" alt="Image 12" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:26:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So why do we keep having a Tarzakian invasion, or did we in the past? It has to do with this [7th Density, 6 o'clock]. When we talk about our moon and we talk about our Sun and we talk about Saturn - and I'm just drawing it in a random position - the Saturn-Moon Matrix has to do with another triangle that would connect these dimensions at specific times, right? So when people talk dimensions, densities, you're really have to figure out what they're talking about.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2022-04-18-WSR-13.PNG" alt="Image 13" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:26:47</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Do you know? Do they know? All I can say is that this side here [Seventh Density Lower] has been fighting very very hard to get through some of the portals in the corona that we've already deleted - and I sent that to the Life Force chat and we chatted about it previously - some of the Amenti portals and whatnot. So in the grand scheme of our life, our human existence, the Cabal works with these folks here [Seventh Density Lower]. So when we talked about like the joint QS system [JAIQS], the quantum system joint agreement where one was Light up here [above top of visible whiteboard] in a Nine, and one was down here [below Seventh Density Lower] and that would have been all black, and then they extended throughout same way [redraws 12-8 and 12-4 o'clock connections] - you kind of get a better understanding of where you're connecting to on the system-wise.

        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:27:48</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So I have this one [points marker above top of whiteboard], DARPA had access to about a Level 8 of this one [below Seventh Density Lower].
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2022-04-18-WSR-15.PNG" alt="Image 15" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:28:01</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So when they keep saying the good side of the military is going to bring in the quantum system and whatever is going to occur and linking with satellites and blah blah blah this [point marker at JAIQS, bottom] is what they're talking about. They're not talking in any way about up here [top of whiteboard] because there's nobody up here. See?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:28:22</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: As we learn and we grow as humans that connection is going to get stronger and stronger over the next eight years or so. Because the second we made that reconnection - that is it - that was the end of the timeline. And that's what we were talking about last time we spoke.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:28:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: This time, it looks a little different. So this structure [Metatron's Cube] is dissipating and it's been replaced with a completely different structure for the Multiverse.
        <br>
        <br>[Clears whiteboard.]
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:29:01</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And we now have a tesseract. So when I said the Covenant of Source expired, Source realized we no longer need that down there - it's out of control, right? And so that started to dissipate. But the structure was still here for anything that remained. Now this had to go - in order for this side [Light side] of the Multiverse to make it - that had to go.
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So we had to develop a different way to create densities. See, if you have ultimate darkness and ultimate light on opposite ends, you know, just like when you have a flashlight, ultimate light is when you're looking at the light bulb in your eye, right? But if you shine the flashlight out, the light becomes less and less dense the further it gets from your person. So that before didn't exist. There was only Source. That was it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:29:57</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So in order to create that darkness, you would have had someone shining an equal and opposite flashlight in the other direction, which then creates the ability to have densities for us to walk around and have a body and be a person, that had to happen, right? To create other life except for Source itself. This is your big bang theory I guess you would kind of say. Did it happen as purported by scientists? I'm just telling you what I got directly, right? From the Source.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:30:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So we still need densities, right? We want planets, we want stars that are of course less dense than the Central Sun. So how do we do that? [Begins drawing.] Well, we created a - and please excuse my terrible drawing (I know, I know, I hear it all the time), we created a Tesseract's Cube.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2022-04-18-WSR-16.PNG" alt="Image 16" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:30:59</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So what does this do? Okay, so it's an energetic binding of some sort, I guess you would say, right? It's not really like... (oops, that was supposed to go back there, this one goes right here.) What it does is it meets the amount of energy coming from the Central Sun so that you do have that flashlight effect. But it's contained within itself, right?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:31:30</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: Is it a physical object Kim? Is it physical?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:31:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: No, it's an energetic object - it's a plasma. (Sunny: Gotcha.) So where Metatron's Cube - you would have seen that if you were to look at that from an energy standpoint - you would have seen Dark lines permeating throughout the Multiverse. Like, complete nothingness, like nothing in there.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:31:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: The other problem that the Metatron's Cube created was its connection to those planets. So like, for example, where the Abraxas were - they agreed, they made this agreement with those on the Other Side for power and what you would call wealth, I guess - not money but wealth - then that [Dark] side of the Multiverse takes over the other [Light] side. See? So if the Abraxas were originally - and they were a Fifth Density civilization - they actually created a direct portal between them and 7th, right? Seven, Eight, Nine - pretty low. And now this almost looks like an energetic loop between the two.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2022-04-18-WSR-17.PNG" alt="Image 17" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:32:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Does that make sense? (That looks really bad.)
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:32:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: It does. What does that loop do though? What's the goal there? What's the purpose?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:32:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Because it creates Darkness on this side of the Multiverse.
        <br>
        <br>(Sunny: Okay.)
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:33:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: And then they eventually took over other areas, other star systems. Like, everybody says, "The Pleiadians are calling. They're so lovely, they're amazing." Well, like I said, all I could really get whenever I talked about the Pleiades was this one lady - she was the only one that would answer the phone. That was a horrible, I mean, a horrible being. She's dead now, but she was horrible. So I'm like, wait a minute. Okay, well, she came through the same way, through the cube structure. See?
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2022-04-18-WSR-18.PNG" alt="Image 18" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:33:37</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: It's so funny when you say call up on the phone! I have these crazy images pop up in my head like, is it literally a phone?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:33:46</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Well, everything is a frequency - language is a frequency. And we are going to go through... We decided that we were going to put some things together, of some suggestions on how to... because we're going to gain a lot of new skills over the next several years. So we're going to create our own - like if you want to fix your car or bake a cake, you go to YouTube, right?
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: Yeah.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:34:09</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Well, if you want to learn how to communicate telepathically, you're going to come here. (Sunny: That's awesome.) So we're going to do little 15-minute... you know, what are you trying to achieve when you go into meditation? What happens to your person when you do that? And how do you make those direct connections? Well, it's going to be different for everyone. But we'll give you some examples of how someone might do this and someone else might do it - how maybe I do it, right? And just give people kind of a basis of what you're doing when you're communicating, how to do it. We used to be able to do this all the time. And some of us still do. But... and I hate to use the word "channeling" because I don't like that word, because I think you should be having a conversation back and forth with another being.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:34:59</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: And consciousness is everywhere, right? So the the entire Multiverse is full of plasma. So it's like having, you know, a direct line, but you have to have the phone number. Now, how do you find the phone number to who you're trying to call? And if you don't know how to do that, you could be going up, you could be going down - you don't know where you're going. See what I mean?
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: Sure.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:35:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: I want to call it Fifth Density or Fifth Dimension, or whatever you think you're calling, right? Because in your mind, you're saying it's the dimension. Well, there's many, many dimensions, but I can tell you this much, there are dimensions that will always add up to a nine. So there is the 18th, right? But there is no, I don't know, just giving you a random number here [writes '16'].
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:35:54</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So to say, you know, the numbers and numbers and numbers, but it really is the base root for like quantum physics, you have to understand. And then everything is a frequency, both positive and negative. And how to protect yourself when you do do this, and when you do go, and when you do start talking to people, and be careful because not everybody's nice, you know. It doesn't matter... if you think just because somebody was up there in the past, then that doesn't mean that they aren't from down here - based on that structure, right? So I don't want anybody to get confused with my horrible writing. I can't even read my own writing sometimes.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2022-04-18-WSR-19.PNG" alt="Image 19" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:36:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So on a grand scale, this is what we're seeing now; we're seeing the implementation of the Tesseract. Which is good, because we don't have to have a Dark Side with that type of structure, right? Things just... the further it gets away from that, the more dense you become. See? So we're going to see how that goes - that was a direct recommendation - so we'll see. And then this structure [Metatron's cube, bottom] is going away, not only in the Multiverse, but it's also going away here on Earth because we don't really need it anymore.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:37:17</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Yeah. And by explaining the whole nebulus thing - you know, the thing that everybody's been trying to tap into all day - which is of course the center... would have been a Dark vortex at the center of Earth in the past, is not there anymore. So it's now going to take you directly to Source where you probably should go anyway because we don't want you.
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: Right, exactly.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:37:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: I think that's what DARPA is up to today or somebody's doing it. I would assume. Generals are very upset that they lost their war, so to speak. No matter how much... you know, it doesn't mean they're not going to try to cause destruction, death, or whatever to us, or issues, or geopathic issues, and try to get it back. But we're already here. And that's why I can report it - because we're already here; it's already here. So this [Tesseract] has already been installed here, so it's dissipating this [Metatron's Cube]. (Sunny: Mmm. Gotcha.) And that was a little hiccup we had yesterday morning.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:38:20</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: And did this need to be implemented before the 24th? Like what's the correlation there?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:38:28</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: This - the nebulus, the Gegenschein - had to be implemented for sure. And then once that started to crest, then we could start to do other energetic things. See? We could start to change the plasma, clearing the plasma, clearing the energy. I mean, for the first time - the Full Moon was like, what, on Saturday? No negative effects, like at all. Usually, like, I feel like I wanna hide under my covers, right? That's the energy that comes from there. Didn't have that. And if it wasn't for that little hiccup yesterday with that other group then we would have been okay. And we still, you know, that was taken care of yesterday. No big deal. We have a few little things going on today but these are little things, these are like Level 4 things.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:39:19</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: And we still have people that are (or folks) from the Other Side that are banging on every portal they can bang on right now, trying to get back to Earth, or come to Earth, right? And it's not gonna happen. So clearing, clearing, clearing today. And they're gonna do everything they can to us between now and the 24th, I'm sure of it. So we just have to stay safe.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:39:46</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Today... I talked about Oak Crest [checking notes]. Yep. And as far as all of the other things in our list here, Miss Sunny, they kind of all seem pretty small in comparison to what we just talked about, right? [Laughing.] (Sunny: Yeah.) You know, Janet Yellen, they thought that they were going to get a hold of the Hall of Records earlier in the month. And... let's see, we talked about the Artemis Accords already...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:40:19</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Oh, the Abraxas Empire fell. Did I talk about that yet?
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: No, well I mean we may have touched on this a little bit. You have some interesting notes here. So maybe we should go over that a little bit.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:40:31</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Yeah, the Abraxas Empire fell on the 3rd. And it had to do with the Intergalactic Treaties of One being removed from the Intergalactic Hall of Records, which, we're just a small part of that. By "One" they meant let's all join hands with the demons of the Multiverse, right? These are Dark Beings down here, and your Chimera are down here, all the things that you hear about that go bump in the night. When we talked about Isis, we talked about the Devil's Wife, right? And these [Dark] beings would regularly incarnate on Earth, just as well as some of these. But you would only be able to incarnate into your matching DNA.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:41:27</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: What level were the Abraxas? Where were they at?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:41:29</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Fifth. They were Fifth Density. Mm-hmm. Yeah, and probably preferred Fifth Density down, really. They were very greedy.
        <br>
        <br>Kim: We talked about... Oh, commerce. Very interesting. And you're gonna find very little about it. If you are in the United States and you're watching this, there was an old treaty from 1796 called Jay's Treaty. And it covered amity, commerce, navigation, who could use what ports - with the British Empire at the time, right? But interestingly, it had a lot to do with the Order of the Black Sun being able to control black-market goods. So anything outside of this that was not in here - it was never revised - and anything outside of that is what gave them control of the black market. Like, the mafia organizations and we all know that certain agencies traffic humans and drugs and everything else into this country. So that actually was canceled and replaced.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:42:43</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Now, this also is the basis which had to do with a lot of our bond systems, our binding systems, right? Our bond markets, our stock markets, those types of things. So, everything that was issued off of your birth certificate - we talked about in the past, birth certificates are bonds, right? And then they go to the ANNA system and then money comes out to take care of your person, before you are 18 years old. And then once you're 18, your taxes - this is where the IRS comes from - your taxes go to pay back that bond and the coupons on the bond, right? Once you're self-sufficient.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:43:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So now you've paid back your free public education that wasn't exactly free, and all these other things, right? You paid with your soul, and your bond. But it also, underneath the new system - it's starting now to dissipate. We don't want to cause major financial disruption, so this has been happening over time. And probably will continue through the end of the month.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:43:49</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: There are a lot of people who would run black market things, like Soros, and a few others - everything was just disappearing. All the derivatives that were issued off your birth certificates - because you actually are the base root for the derivatives market that is way out of control. So leveraging contracts, leveraging, leveraging and re-leveraging - that's why some people say, "Well, when I look up my mortgage in the mortgage system called MERS, I can see that I have seven mortgages." Well that's why. That's what you're seeing. Yeah exactly, the bank gets to have money seven times but we don't get seven times right? Of course.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:44:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So we have, let's see... let's go back to the 5th, balance, order, and completion. Yeah, they're saying that April 26th is going to actually be the really big day because we'll be back to balance, order, and completion of all agreements, and everything will be closed for totality. These are some more of the energetic binding agreements and these types of things and for those people to exist here.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:45:04</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: We talked about the flights and the flight issues that happened. That's over now. Let's see....
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: What about, Kim, what about chemtrails? I know a lot of people have been posting pictures and stuff like that on Telegram. What's going on with the chemtrails right now?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:45:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Well, they were preparing for the alignment which they thought was with the Black Sun (or the Dark Sun), which was going to give them the ultimate power. So when not enough people took the jabs to cause enough of a disruption, or a depopulation - as they had intended - they wanted to basically get rid of us all, right? Only keep a few to be slaves to them and life would be glorious, according to them.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:46:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: But that's why they started, what do you want to say, spraying chemtrails all over the place. That's what it had to do with. It had to do with them trying to install these whatever you want to call them, nanobots into us, one way or another. Putting them in food and all kinds of other things, for the last couple of weeks, I guess you would say, for the last month or two. They will not get the charge that they are expecting to get - they did not get their charge on the 18th that they thought they were going to have, right? Or sorry, by the 18th. It's been three days since the Full Moon.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:46:39</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And the Full Moon is what activates the neural links, and the ARCHONS. And yeah, so it's a compilation of metals and then there's usually a big shot from the Dark Side to Saturn's rings, which then hits us right in our ARCHONS - hits you right in the ARCHONS!(Laughing.)
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:46:59</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: Those little buggers [chuckle].
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:47:04</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Yeah. And so they had to do everything they could because they needed that burst so that they thought that we would all go. But you know, karma is kind of crazy isn't it? Maybe it's gonna be the opposite? It's what I'm hoping happens anyway.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:47:20</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: Is there another date that they're aiming for that you're aware of? Just because we seem to be experiencing a lot of chemtrails recently? Is there something else they could be aiming for right now?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:47:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Well, this was just Saturday, right? And I know that they're still doing it. Of course, they don't want to tell their, what do you want to say it? (Sunny: Minions?) Underlings, minions, right? That it's not happening.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:47:46</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: Okay, so maybe they're just kind of keeping up the show, even though they know?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:47:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: I think they just haven't told anybody to stop. And like I said, they had Oak Ridge Laboratories. They had - this is just today, right? That, and then DARPA's trying to get into Hell In a Box, or whatever it was that's not there anymore. Yeah, I mean everybody's hack-hack-hacking away that's for sure today. Both at us and... so I mean, like I said, it had a little bit of an effect on us, and people - if you've been on your computer a long time, you're having headaches and whatnot - but it wasn't nearly what they had desired to happen, right?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:48:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: Right. Okay, so do you think this is going to ramp up? Like, headaches and things like that? I mean you said they're going to come at us full force probably until the 24th, even after that. Like what can people expect in the next six or so days?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:48:47</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Well, some of us will start experiencing these really big bursts of just feeling great and clear, and it feels almost like you all of a sudden are seeing better and you can hear better. Like you can hear everything. Like all of a sudden, all your senses are kind of getting amplified at the same time. And maybe your brain would be thinking better. Maybe things... you'll start to feel changes of us going back to our former human selves, right? And it's going to be gradual, and it will be over time. And for some, it'll be like, "Wow!" You know? And then others, it'll be like, "Well, I feel different, not sure why." And then it will just take a little bit more time. It just depends on how close you already were to those connections. But it'll be a lot easier, that's for sure.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:49:45</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Okay, let's see [flipping through notes], talked about that already... I just want to make sure I've got everything... I think so, other than what probably I have to do when I hang up the phone here, other than in between that and my interview that I've got to have shortly.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:50:04</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: One question I had, Kim. I've seen a lot of stuff posted on snake venom recently. Can you address that at all? It seems like Telegram is lighting up about snake venom.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:50:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: I know.
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: Is it worth going into? What's the story?
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Well, it is definitely producing side effects for some. But I don't... and I do know that it's in there. And that's why you see the people shaking - it's a neurotoxin.
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: We're talking about the vaccines, the jabs now?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:50:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Yeah, yeah, it's in there. You know, they really probably didn't even intend for that to happen, but it just happened. And I don't know if it's actual snake venom... I think it's something different, or at least in the earlier ones. In the earlier ones there was Luciferin. Which is funny.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:50:55</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: Right I've heard that. Yes.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:50:57</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Right. So Luciferin is the same thing that makes dragonflies tails light up in the darkness. And it also can cause - it's not healthy for humans - but it can also cause neurological disorders. So I know in the earlier ones that was in there. So maybe that didn't cause enough problems and they went to the bigger snake, or, I'm not sure - I'm not sure what they were trying to prove there.
        <br>
        <br>Kim: But hopefully everyone will be okay. We do have things to reverse that out. And we've talked about those. I know Lisa's gone into it a number of times to try to help those that have been with effects and side effects. So we're working; we're working on everything. But we can't go forward until this is over, because we'll just be fighting this war for the next 3 million years.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:51:57</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: We talked about being here on Earth, we're so close to everything happening. What is the perspective, if you can give us an idea of the perspective of other beings that are watching this happening? I think I saw somewhere in your notes it was that the Earth Council was really excited about stuff that was happening now. Can you give us an idea of what the mood is? I don't know if that's the right word but like - (Kim: What the vibe is?) - yeah. I mean, this is big, right? And we're just so close to it. I would love to get like the 30,000 (a lot more than that) view of what is happening from a - just other beings, what they're witnessing here.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:52:37</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: I would say that they're all very happy about this situation [Metatron's Cube] going away. The old ruling councils and the Pleiades are coming back, they're trying to reorganize - they're also in transition. We talked before about we're not the only planet in transition. So all of these planets [5th Density and higher], well except for these [7th Density] - maybe someone will get moved there later. But these are different star systems - not just planets - they're star systems. So all of these people that have been affected by this. Or, if you were located in the line of sight, so to speak [references 10, 2, and 6 o'clock positions of Metatron's Cube], you would have been affected by this too. So there are several of us, and then there are... so there are other planets in the Third Density or Third Dimension, right?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:53:31</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: Right.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:53:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>[Erases Metatron's Cube.]
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So, they were slave planets, basically. They had been taken over completely. So we have six planets [begins drawing planets in a circle]. We've got Earth - I'm not like "we're in the center," like everybody revolves around us but okay, anyway, whatever - so they're all doing the same thing that we're doing with their own respective, either Gegenschein or Planet or Moon, if they still have their own Moon. And they're all making that connection directly back to Source [center of circle]. At the same time we are.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:54:19</small></small>

        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2022-04-18-WSR-20.PNG" alt="Image 20" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:54:20</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: Oh, wow.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:54:22</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So they're all going to go through transition, but everybody's prepared, and it's all going well. So far, so good.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:54:30</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: OK. All right. And there's humans on these, or humanoids on these other planets?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:54:35</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Well, there's humans everywhere. But some are and some are not. They're not bad people, they're just people that have been enslaved for many years. (Sunny: Like us.) So that's the reason why the colonies were appointed - to stop this situation from happening, right?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:54:57</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So I think, that being said, I know that they were talking - when I said the Council was all excited, now that's the Universal Council - and everybody was happy to see that whole structure go away. Now, everybody's working really hard to make sure that all this happens for us, and then everybody's safe forever. That's why everybody's like, "The 24th! The 24th! The 24th!" And the Dark Side is trying to do everything else they can do to us in the meantime - connect to anything. Reestablish that connection. They've got the Space Force on it, DARPA's on it - everybody's on it today. But it takes awhile for news to travel. And this was something that took place, what, 4 or 5 days ago? A little slow.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:55:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: You wouldn't think it would be, but I guess.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:55:55</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Well, but if you don't know what it is...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:55:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: Yeah, you don't know what you're looking for, yeah.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:56:00</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Yeah, they don't know how all of their friends got here.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:56:04</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: Yeah, okay.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:56:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: But I'm telling them now how they used to get here, and why the connection isn't strong enough anymore. What used to be like a solid black line of plasma is now like heather gray. It's like just pale gray. It's dissipating every single day that goes by, and that big boost we got this morning is a direct indication that it's just going to get worse and worse. So we'll get another one and another one.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:56:34</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So yeah, very exciting. But with the advent of the Tesseract, we could possibly - they're talking about maybe seeing if they can reach out to what's positive left in those respective places, and see if we can save a few more planets at the same time. But right now I know that there's six ready to go.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:56:56</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: Wow, that's big.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:56:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Mm-hmm. I know. It's big for everyone. Everybody's happy with this version of humans, except for... them.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:57:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: Well, except the Deep State [laughing]. That's OK.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:57:09</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Oh, not everybody!
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:57:12</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: The people we want to be happy, the beings we want to be happy are happy right now.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:57:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: We're severing our relationship with the ones that are not generally found to be positive here.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:57:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: Okay. And are there more things that you expect, like you know, the building of the cube that you - what is it called?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:57:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: This is the Tesseract.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:57:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: The Tesseract, okay. So, will there be more things like that? That you think will be built or happen between now and the 24th? Or, do you think that was kind of the last big thing and now we're kind of like holding on and waiting?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:57:47</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Well, it kind of seems like that. I mean, we're handling issues as they come up to try to prevent pain to people. And we've had a lot of extremely low frequencies and interference and whatnot on that level. And so we're just trying to mitigate that. We're not letting any of them in here. What's here already, hopefully will go at that point. And we're trying to do our best to just hold the fort.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:58:19</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: Right. That's what I feel like. I feel like we're like grabbing onto the side going hold on guys, hold on!
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:58:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: What's next? Duck!! [Laughing.] Yeah, that's pretty much what we've been doing for the last few days since we installed that. Yeah, I mean there are some that are trapped in here [the Tesseract]. Like, today's issue had to do with the disconnecting of... you know, it fades faster in the higher dimensions, right? So the higher dimensional planets lost their connection to the Lower Astral today, due to that burst that I talked about earlier. And that was great for them, but bad for us because they went running, and now everybody's been banging on our door, trying to get in here. They don't have any place else to go. They want to still exist on this side.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:59:15</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: Yeah. Okay.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:59:17</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: That took place in the Sixth Dimension.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:59:19</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: Okay. And then we have another burst - so, we had one today, and would you say 2, or 3 to 4 days out? Every 3 to 4 days we'll have a burst?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:59:30</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Yeah, it's about between 3 and 4 days. Sunny (Okay. All right.) But this next one should be really good. That's on Saturday, right?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:59:40</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: Yeah. Yeah.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:59:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: So we probably have one more in between there. OK.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:59:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: In a couple of days. Yeah.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:59:46</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: Oh, goodness.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:59:48</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: I know. Great, huh?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:59:49</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: Well, like I said before, this is the most amazing time to be alive. I mean, I don't know that I can recall. You know, I just feel very lucky to be here and to be part of all of this. And yeah, I mean, part of it's like, you just don't know what's going to happen, but you know it's going to be a positive thing. And so it's like an excitement, but you just kind of don't know what to expect. But yeah, I just hope other people... we have our community of people that know what's going on. I just can't wait for that day that more and more people, and hopefully this will happen in events and things leading up to the 24th, where those people just, something clicks. You know, that's what I'm waiting for. That's what I'm really excited for.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:00:30</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: And I think that's gonna happen faster and faster as we go along. So hopefully, you know, by next Monday, things are really going to change. So, I don't even know what to expect, really. I mean, remember, I just talk to Source and things happen, and then I'm like, "Okay, let's do the next one."
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:00:49</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: Yeah, exactly. Well, thank you, Kim. Thank you for all you do.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:00:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Thank you, Sunny.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:00:54</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: Yeah. Of course, everyone, keep it here. United Network News will give you guys the latest of what's going on. And lots of stuff's going on, sometimes we don't get a chance to bring it to you every day, but lots of stuff going on and I feel like we're moving in a positive direction.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:01:09</small></small>

        <br>Kim: Me too.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:01:09</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: And a lot of that, a lot of that's due to your work, Kim, so thank you.
