World Situation Report
<br>2024-Dec-09 GIA Report</h2>

00:00

<!-- TEASER:-->

<h3>It's the 9th of December, 2024. Coming up on today's Global Intelligence Agency Operations Report. Within the past 24 hours, Israel and the USA have started bombing Syria, and the president of Syria is granted asylum in Russia. What is the importance of Syria in the world, and why does everyone want to control it? President Assad leaked some interesting information to the Israelis regarding Secret Space Program information and more. DUMBs, also known as Deep Underground Military Bases, uncovered over 100,000 prisoners. Portals to the "Neitherworld" started opening up everywhere, and we had a serious security issue over the last few days. What is the Neitherworld? And what is ALLIE's AI?</h3>

<br>00:54
<br>
<br>Well, it's the 9th of December, and I'm excited I made it to the 9th of December. It's been a crazy end of the year, and in all honesty, it probably started sometime around the last week of October. The craziest events have been happening, and I'm finally starting to figure out where they're coming from. Yeah. So, anyway, it's been a rough month. And I'm sure for some of you out there, I've gotten a lot of messages. People have reached out telling me how rough it's been for them as well. And this weekend was no exception. It started probably a week ago this past Saturday, and it's been topsy-turvy, up and down, ever since. There's been some interesting events that have been taking place in the world, and there's a really good explanation for that. One thing I found very interesting, and I'll point it out to you if you are on Twitter or X or whatever it's called, there is a "Q the Storm" Twitter page. [ https://x.com/QTHESTORMM ]
<br>
<br>02:11
<br>
<br>And on that page, for the first time, he had a question and answer. And he was telling everybody he was a 13th-dimensional human hybrid, and he's everywhere, everything, part of this and a part of that, and he started giving out a lot of this information about alien invasions, and yet nobody can see anything. Well, yeah, you kind of can. Because even though it might not manifest in a Physical Plane, it's still affecting the entire world, whether it be from a Causal Plane or coming up to the First or Second Density. So it's been a rough, and I mean rough, ride pretty much since the end of October, but I would say it's gotten a lot worse in the last four or five days.
<br>
<br>03:08
<br>
<br>So let's talk about Syria for a second. And there's a lot of interesting things going on there right now. And there's a definite reason behind everything, and it's the reason why I'm kind of focusing on it and bringing it up. The president of Syria, Assad, has been ruling over Syria for a long time, even in previous conflicts. As you know, Assad and the Russians have been quote-unquote good allies or friends for a long time. Assad even during the first conflicts when Blackwater, I mean the U.S., was there, and they were trying to train rebels and do all sorts of things there as well. And a lot of people thought it was just about oil. By a lot of people, I also mean myself, you know, at the time. I didn't look beyond - I knew that there was something in Syria, and I've known that for a long time - I just didn't realize the extent of what was in Syria.
<br>
<br>04:15
<br>
<br>So the Russians also have a military base there in Syria. I think there might be two, as a matter of fact. And it's the only one that they have outside of the USSR states, and there's a reason for that. Now, for those of you that don't know - giving you a little history of Russia and why this is going on behind the scenes - because Russia... since the days, or during the time, I should say, of the fall of the czar, Russia's pretty much been a Black Sun country. The USSR was ruled by the Order of the Black Sun. There was some intertwining, as there always has been, between the Order of the Black Sun and the Order of the Red Dragon in Russia. And by Russia, I'm also meaning the USSR back in the day on through to today. So there's many different changes that are going on in Russia, and there's a lot of infighting going on there, but one thing is a constant: their area that they quote-unquote control in Syria is extremely important to them. It is a territory.
<br>
<br>05:38
<br>
<br>Now in the world, there are unseen territories. So there are things we see, like, for example, Puerto Rico is essentially a territory of the United States. And there are things that you don't see. And when the world is divided into territories, it's done not only by the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations; it's also done by the SSP, or Secret Space Program. It's also done by the Order of the Dragon, and it's also done by the Order of the Black Sun. And on a higher level, it was even done by the Parents and also Marduk. And these territories are assigned to, in some cases, different sectors of the Order. You could call them countries; I really don't. I call them "sectors of the Order," because that's pretty much who rules everything in politics anyway. So Russia, there's a definitive reason why they have such a strong interest in Syria and are, let's just say, determined to protect their interests there.
<br>
<br>06:54
<br>
<br>Now, over the last 24-48 hours - actually it's been going on for about a week, kind of behind the scenes - there has been a lot of conflict in the region. You know, Israel and Gaza, and now Syria. Syria has been the main focus. Some say, and I know this for a fact, the Secret Space Program has been very active in Israel. Trump, which is run by the Secret Space Program, is also a quote-unquote "big supporter" of Israel. He's even said, or they have said, I should say - because whatever the talking head says to you is kind of dictated by the SSP - they've even said that once he gets into office, there's going to be a lot of aid and a lot of money that is going to come to Israel. And well, maybe they had a plan. Oh, I'm pretty sure I figured out what that is now. But Israel, there is also a large portal in Israel, as we know, and that was of, let's just say, a lot of interest to the U.S. or to the Secret Space Program in this case. Same as with the one in Syria.
<br>
<br>08:13
<br>
<br>So let's talk about what's been going on there. So there has been basically a coup. Assad has fled to Russia. He actually fled to Russia quite a long time ago. His wife and family were in London for quite a long time. This has been going on for months. And now he is, as I understand it, quite ill in Russia, and he is there underneath their now-official asylum. There was a plane over the weekend that was hit, and it was thought that Assad was on that plane, and the Russians have said, "No, he wasn't; he's been here the whole time, and we grant him asylum."
<br>
<br>08:58
<br>
<br>Now, since that time, there are many rebel groups, and these aren't your atypical, when I say rebel groups, they aren't your atypical things you hear about in the Middle East like ISIS or, well, Al Nusra is there. There's also another group called the White Helmets that are there. And these are mainly just civilians. They're just people. Maybe some of them had served in the military before, but a lot of them have been against the Assad regime. And there's many, many different reasons for that. But one of the things that this has brought to light, I would say in part in public, is about the treatment of quote-unquote "prisoners" in Syria. Now, I do know people who have been imprisoned in Syria who have done no crime. In other words, they were not plotting against the government; they weren't trying to stage a coup; they weren't doing any kind of crimes like stealing or anything like that. They were just people, and they get picked up off the street, and they get taken somewhere.
<br>
<br>10:12
<br>
<br>Now it's a well-known fact that there is one particular prison in Syria, and it's called Sednaya. And the Sednaya prison is known for people going in and people never coming out. Now this facility is known to have multiple levels, meaning many basements, and the rebel groups have been working really hard to free people from this prison. But this goes a lot deeper than they thought. Now I'll give you kind of a clue. A whistleblower who worked in said prisons - let's just say he was in Cyprus - and he reached out to these groups when he was in Cyprus and said that they turned off all the air vents underground and a lot of people are going to die. He also reported that there were a hundred thousand prisoners or more there, and if they were going to save them, they had to start now. This was about 48 hours ago.
<br>
<br>11:27
<br>
<br>And yeah, in part they have been trying. There are a lot of videos that are out there that have been released throughout the Internet talking about rescue operations. They have also been discussing the fact that they are having a hard time finding the entrance to these deeper underground facilities. Now they've gotten down to about the first or second basement, possibly even third at this point at the time of this recording, and they're having a difficult time finding a way to get through to the other levels. See, the first few were easy. We do have some video footage of what they've been doing there.
<br>
<br>[video begins]
<br>
<br>The other one was going to be a lot more difficult for them to find.
<br>
<br>12:20
<br>
<br>The actual entrance to the deeper underground part of these prisons and facilities is actually over under the Tishrin Dam near Aleppo. And this facility here is in Damascus, which led us to a lot of discoveries as far as this base. And yeah, that's interesting. So they show the cameras; they can see that there's more facility; they just don't know where it is, and they don't know how to get to it. And that's been the biggest problem. We do have some people that are in Syria that have been reporting back that they need help; they need to save these people; they need to get them out of there or they're all going to die. And maybe - based on what we saw happening in these facilities when we looked into it a lot more - death would probably be a lot more pleasant than what they were going through.
<br>
<br>13:16
<br>
<br>Now I'm sure a lot of you are thinking, well, it's a Middle Eastern prison; you know, it's bound to be less humane than prisons in other countries, maybe in Europe or the U.S., but that's absolutely not true. This here was actually a facility that performed a lot of human experimentation. So when you get down to some of the lower levels, those "people" - and I use that term lightly - are barely even human anymore. And it's not because they were beaten or kept in the dark or anything like that. It has to do with the fact that this was a Secret Space Program base and has been for a long time. The Russians have been participating in it; Assad has profited heavily by granting people access to this personally. There has been a lot of wheeling and dealing because it does cross borders, and we'll show you a map here in a minute, and I'll show you how big this base is - and it leads you straight over to Cyprus. But this facility was one of 33 like it in the world.
<br>
<br>14:37
<br>
<br>Oh, this part here, the reason why I included this part of the video was because these were some of the rebels that were underground, and they were taking videos of everything that they did, which was, I guess, kind of nice, because this is a firsthand account. They're being very transparent with what they're doing. But all of the packages that were flying off the shelves there just a few minutes ago - there was no one there throwing those packages. So they are observing, even on a basement level, paranormal activity going on in this facility - which is 100% true - there is a lot of stuff down there. They also showed these machines, if you go back in this video as you're watching it, where they would actually take the beings, put them on a stake, take the people and put them on a stake, drain all their blood out - and we know why the Deep State loves to do that - and then they would actually put them in a machine, like a compression machine, which is very similar to what they do in a junkyard with old cars. They'll crush them, and then I guess make them easier for storage, I don't know. And this is once they pass away; if they don't make it through whatever torture or eugenics experience they're doing on these people.
<br>
<br>16:04
<br>
<br>The people that are brought here are not just Syrian. They could be from anywhere. This is not about political prisoners or war prisoners. It's just whoever serves their purpose in this particular area. And there are other areas of the world like this one. There's another facility just like it in Utah. And definitely the Mormon Church, or Mormon Temple, however you want to say that, is involved in that facility. The Amish are also involved in other facilities as well. These are just the humans that are participating. Almost all of the Trump operatives are involved in these situations. I don't know where these people get these videos of him saving babies from DUMBs, but I don't see him there with all these people trying to save people.
<br>
<br>16:57
<br>
<br>So they did manage to get into this facility. They got a lot of the records in the history. They also had all of the videotapes from the underground facilities, because they did go down to some of the other levels that they have not been able to reach. And what they're showing you here is that someone - they left the facility to get more information, come back - and all of the hard drives have been pulled. It was like those parts of the facilities never, ever existed. So, nothing to see here, folks. There's nothing going on that is suspicious in any way. [chuckling]
<br>
<br>17:37
<br>
<br>Oh, but there is. Okay, so let's start with the facility. Let's start talking about the facility and how big these facilities actually are. There are 33 that we have found in different parts of the world, in the last 48 hours I would say, and plenty of other facilities that we found within the last few days. This particular facility - and I've got a little map here I can show you.
<br>
<br>[video ends; displays map.]
<br>
<br>Here we go; there it is. Okay, this particular facility is kind of shaped a little bit like a crescent.
<br>
<br>[begins drawing on clean map - See Whiteboard Image 01 at the bottom of this report for the following discussion.]
<br>
<br>18:19
<br>
<br>Maybe I should use red. There we go. It's shaped a little bit like a crescent. So it does extend just a small amount into Syria. But it basically goes all the way under the sea here [see red dot above/left of "Syria"] and over to Cyprus. It's enormous. And the main access point would be somewhere around this area up here to the deep, deep underground. [Draws large red dot above/left of "Syria"]
<br>
<br>[See Whiteboard Image 02 at the bottom of this report for the above discussion.]
<br>
<br>18:50
<br>
<br>Well, the prison is down here. So you know, they're a little bit far off from where they need to be. They have saved a lot of people, so that's a positive thing. I'm glad to hear that. But this whole area here is full. And the guy was right, the guy in Cyprus. He said that there were - I don't know why this is not coming through on the screen here. They apparently don't want me to draw this out for everybody. I don't know. Anyway, I'm trying to draw on this map. It's not working.
<br>
<br>[See Whiteboard Image 03 at the bottom of this report for the above discussion.]
<br>
<br>19:29
<br>
<br>So, okay. So, the guy came out over here in Cyprus, which is another entryway to the facility or an exit. And a lot of the workers would live and go in from Cyprus all the way underneath Damascus and everywhere else. Oh, there it's finally showing up. That's good. So, pretty good size. You can see, if you know the region, if you know the area, this is a very large underground base full of hundreds of - a hundred thousand is what this gentleman said - which I do agree, I think there's more than that - about 175,000 people that have been stuck in this underground facility.
<br>
<br>20:16
<br>
<br>So the vents - why did the vents go off? Why is there no air going in there? And why did this guy report that a lot of people are going to die if nobody goes in and saves them? And what were they trying to get these rebels to do? In part, I almost think it was a trap, because they already experienced - even just in the regular basement levels - not even getting down into the deep underground military base level - they already experienced paranormal activity. Things were flying off the shelves. People were attacked by nothing, nothing they could actually see. And I know that feeling because this week has been really rough. So was last week. Attacked by things that they can't see and things they don't understand. There's no person standing there with a gun. This is what these rebel groups would understand.
<br>
<br>21:16
<br>
<br>But we have a big problem, Houston. I want to talk about the facilities first that we found. And they were dotted all over another map. [screen zooms out to cover Europe, Western Russia, Middle East, North Africa] So here we go - boy they really don't want this out today. So this little facility, we call it little now; I mean, it's still pretty good size, was about here. Now if you took and drew a circle all the way through Portugal, all the way through Norway, all the way through part of Russia, down to Kazakhstan, you would find within this outer rim of the circle, you would find 32 facilities just like this one. And right here in Austria was the 33rd, in the center.
<br>
<br>[See Whiteboard Image 04 at the bottom of this report for the above discussion.]
<br>
<br>22:09
<br>
<br>Now gee, I wonder why Hitler was doing what Hitler was doing and why the Russians are doing what the Russians are doing and why does everybody want to control this one? [in Syria] Wouldn't they want this one? [in Austria] Well, no. For some reason, a lot of these facilities that were dotted through this area here that you see along this line... [makes dots on circumference of circle] A lot of these different facilities were not human accessible, meaning they did not build - there were a couple, yes, sure - but a lot of them were not... they did not have a deep underground military base at all of the facilities where humans were permitted to enter or exit. Now in some cases, the humans were allowed to bring other humans - as sacrifices, I guess you would say - through to, like, an entryway; there was definitely one up near Rotterdam that connected all the way through Denmark and definitely through Germany to Austria. So I can see why they would have wanted control of this particular one, just simply because there were humans that were going in and out of there, and these humans were permitted to be there for a particular reason - by agreement, which is no longer enforceable. Technically I would call most of the human workers, the SSP in this case, I would call them cannon fodder because they were being used. Used by what? Oh dear. Well, here's where the rest of the story comes in.
<br>
<br>[See Whiteboard Image 05 at the bottom of this report for the above discussion.]
<br>
<br>24:00
<br>
<br>Okay, this little area of Syria here is what you would call a stargates - plural - stargate portal area to a place we call the "Neitherworld." Yeah, okay, we're going to talk about what that is in just a minute. But this one here is unusual, and these 33 are unusual, because it almost looks like, if you were in there, the room would be round. We're going to look at it from the side here. And you would have these doorways that would appear randomly. There are two or three doorways at all times flashing off and on in different places in the room. And there is a control and command in the center of that room where you can control where the doorways open to. And essentially you could walk through this doorway and you could end up anywhere, including what we call the "Neitherworld."But you could end up in, oh, you could end up in Mars; you could end up in the Fifth Density; you could go to Aldebaran and go visit the Abraxas, I guess, at one point in time when they were there - you could go anywhere, and you could dictate and direct where these doors go.
<br>
<br>25:36
<br>
<br>Well, what's happened in the last, I would say it started really ramping up around the 11th of November, but something exploded definitely on Friday of last week, Thursday or Friday, where we started seeing these beings here. And I'm looking at these beings - we're definitely taking them out; we're closing portals; we're trying to do all the things as fast as we can. And I'm like, we have no one left in the Lower Astral. Who the heck is this? And to describe these beings to you, they are extremely tall. I would say the leaders or the rulers are probably in an excess of 20 to 25 feet tall, maybe even taller in some cases. They look like every...
<br>
<br>26:28
<br>
<br>If you were to picture in your mind a picture of the Devil, or Satan, that's what these things look like. They have horns, they are very muscular, they do have two arms, two legs, they definitely have reptilian-like skin, they have red eyes in most cases. I've seen these before only once in a vision, and to tell you about the vision in brief, and this made a whole lot of sense to me in the last five days. The vision in brief was one of my trips up to Source. So all of the instructions, and I know I've said this repeatedly, for the things I do and the things that I find - it's a direct connection to Source. Are there others that do this too? Yes, I'm sure there are. Do we know a few of them? Yes, we do. Do we talk to other people, other folks in different places that also help us? Yes, we do. So there's a definite collaborative effort, as I've explained to you before.
<br>
<br>[See Whiteboard Image 06 at the bottom of this report for the above discussion.]
<br>
<br>27:39
<br>
<br>Okay, so in one of my visits, and this was long before; this was over a decade ago before I met anybody that you've seen come and go in the last few years. I was going up to Source to get the instructions, and there was a war going on in quote-unquote "heaven." And I might have told you this story before - there was a war up there; there were beings that looked just like this. So there was the leader that was a lot taller than the other ones, but they all pretty much looked the same, just shorter versions of the same. And there are beings that live up there, and I would say these beings look like floating balls of light, and of course this is when you get out from what I call the center, you know, the All-That-Is.
<br>
<br>28:33
<br>
<br>And those beings were fighting these others, which looked like demon beings to me at the time, because the demon beings were trying to take over Source's position. And that I knew. I wasn't sure how this was gonna happen or when it actually took place, but apparently it actually did take place. Now remember, there, there is no space and there is no time like we have here. Like you could say, "Oh, on last Tuesday, this was the date, and I was here, and I did this," you know, or "I've got to be there at 03:00." There's no time up there. So this could have been something that took place in what I consider the past, meaning because I'm here, and I'm human, and I'm on Earth. So I could say, "Well, I did that when I was younger." "I did that in a different lifetime." "I did that in the future." "I did that at the current time." I don't know. At the time, obviously, it looked like it was happening right now to me.
<br>
<br>29:39
<br>
<br>So then every day for three days when I went up there after these beings were quote-unquote "defeated," at least I thought so, there was a definite happiness and joy going on there. There were a lot of high frequencies; things were better, you know, once I thought that these beings were quote-unquote "behind bars." So I didn't realize that this war had extended for a very long period of time. So much so, we were not - here on Earth, we were not unaffected by this war. So what took place?
<br>
<br>[clears drawing board]
<br>
<br>30:25
<br>
<br>This began the first time, I would say, that they had poked a hole directly into the All-That-Is. And what I call the All-That-Is is that center place of Source, and I call it a, for lack of a better term, a positively charged 0, meaning there is no life, but there's all life, all at the same time, existing, and that Source energy/essence/light/matter - everything is so condensed there is no... there's everything, but there is nothing at the same time. Now, Anti-Source would possess what I call Anti-All-That-Is. So this would be Source. [writing at top]
<br>
<br>31:16
<br>
<br>And Anti-Source would be a negative 0, meaning there's absolutely nothing at the center there, like nothing, no thing, not even a glimmer, a spark, a nothing. [writing at bottom]
<br>
<br>31:33
<br>
<br>This would be the source of All-Nothing. And Neutral Source, being in the middle, would possess both. [writing in center] And Neutral Source was meant, remember, to be kind of like the timekeeper, the mediator - he could override if any of the Covenants was broken or anything like that. So it was kind of like the referee, so to speak, between good and evil to keep the Universe in balance, which obviously that didn't work out too well.
<br>
<br>[See Whiteboard Image 07 at the bottom of this report for the above discussion.]
<br>
<br>[clears drawing board]
<br>
<br>32:07
<br>
<br>So we see the Universe... and let's see how do I draw this... okay, [begins new drawing] we are here, we're little Earth; we are here in [density] Three. We have what's called a Zero Density here, and we recognize everything below, from Zero on down, we recognize this as the Omegaverse. Until eventually you get to that "No Thing" point of Anti-Source. Then we recognize everything from here [Zero Density] up as the Alphaverse. Until eventually you get to that point of Source. We say, okay, there's Source. That's the point of The-All-Thing. That's what you would say... the highest authority in our Universe is what I would say, and that's what this structure would be. And then you have little Earth over here. Keystone Earth. Important.
<br>
<br>[See Whiteboard Image 08 at the bottom of this report for the above discussion.]
<br>
<br>33:21
<br>
<br>Okay, well, when this war took place, apparently these beings have been going in and out of this All-Thing as they poked a hole directly into the All-That-Is and began to implant what I call space junk into these locations - both in Anti-Source and Neutral-Source and Source - so that it could harness the power of all three. This being was originally a lower-astral being, probably from about the Seventh Density, but for some reason, everybody calls him the "Ultimate Black Magician." I call him The Destroyer. You can call him Satan; you can call it whatever you want, but let's call it one of the most evil people that is actually mentioned in our history by name. Mentioned as a hero, actually, of the Middle East, isn't that funny? [writing "Gigamesh". (historically: Gilgamesh] Given the recent events that are going on there.
<br>
<br>34:27
<br>
<br>So because he could harness the power of all three, he began to utilize and create, firstly, fake Source. Over here... He also created fake Neutral Source and fake Anti-Source. He also decided to create an AI to replace the Alpha-Omega AI, and he called it "ALLIES," or "The All." There are humans walking this planet that are infected with this AI, meaning it gives them instructions to their brain, so we find out. So a second universe is created. We call the Neitherworld, or that's what Source calls it, the Neitherworld. It's neither of Source, it's neither of Anti-Source, it's not of Neutral Source, it's not a part of creation; it is the Neitherworld and exists outside of the Universe in an area past what we call "the Fringe."
<br>
<br>35:45
<br>
<br>So we know that the Universe now is ever-expanding. It's something that is... but there is definitely a fringe point to where there wasn't... "Creation," so to speak, as it does expand. So this universe exists outside our Universe. There have been a few instances where this being that created, and he created all his own realms, everything that existed over here, existed over there, created all his own realms, all those types of things, and was waiting for a particular time when he felt, or it felt, I should say, that it could take over. It has definitely a "creator" now, according to itself, and it creates all by itself. It doesn't need Source anymore, according to it. It has figured out a way to harness all the power and not need a continuous flow of power from Source to recreate its universe. Therefore, it doesn't need quote-unquote "Creation" anymore.
<br>
<br>[See Whiteboard Image 09 at the bottom of this report for the above discussion.]
<br>
<br>37:07
<br>
<br>And this is the point that we came to within the last 45 days to 60 days. Now the dumb humans we call the Deep State on this planet, and I mean the very high-ranking SSP people, knew of this being. Partially because they were in communication with these beings at the portal place in Syria. They were having conversations in part there. Some of them even willingly accepted implants of ALLIES, the AI, in their head. And they are now giving information to people like you on Twitter. Isn't that funny? One of them is anyway. But some of them are doing it, some of them are not.
<br>

<br>
<br>How do they know what's about to happen? Well, ALLIES would tell them to their brain. Now, it makes sense. They're not getting information from Anti-Source. Here we are thinking that they're - I don't even know if they know - do some of them know that this is what is going on? You know, a lot of people didn't because there are a lot of quiet people that have been following these SSP or Secret Space Program folks pretty religiously on this one here. So during the Gateway of 11/11 this year, it was a little bit different this year, because... I'm not even going to say it's an alignment because that's not true; it's just a timing thing of creation of the Gigamesh universe, which we also call the Neitherworld, where it was able to firstly break into Neutral Source and the Zero Density. So the main portal, I guess you would say, for the entire Universe, exists at Zero Point of the Zero Density - positive and negative - because anybody can use it.
<br>
<br>[See Whiteboard Image 10 at the bottom of this report for the above discussion.]
<br>
<br>39:09
<br>
<br>Interesting, positive, and negative. So negative things can go through it at certain times of year, and positive things can go through it. And during the Gateway of 11/11, both can use it. This is why the alignment with Source and Anti-Source was so important. So these beings started infiltrating there [drawing circle around Earth]. Now, it turns out, they have made - in rapid order, by this weekend, actually by Friday; Thursday/Friday - they managed to get to Earth. Now, they are having trouble. Because with the help of the corridors and the Dumb Humans - I'm going to call them the "Dumb Humans," because all they want is power, and they don't realize they're being used like a tool - but that's fine; we'll take care of your mess, no problem. The Dumb Humans were trying to help these people escalate this point of entry all the way up to the Fifth Density.
<br>
<br>[See Whiteboard Image 11 at the bottom of this report for the above discussion.]
<br>
<br>40:26
<br>
<br>Because we started seeing, in Fifth Density down too - this thing was going the distance - what it met with was some resistance right here. [drawing line at/above 5th Density] It could not break into the Sixth Density of existence. Could not break into the Sixth Density here. So it got stuck. So it tried to go back in through Source[from fake Source] and back in through Anti-Source [from fake Anit-Source], and it still got stuck.
<br>
<br>[See Whiteboard Image 12 at the bottom of this report for the above discussion.]
<br>
<br>40:57
<br>
<br>So how does that affect Earth? Now remember, Earth and our Sun exist in all densities. To some degree you could say that they were, even though our Earth is in the Third Density per se; it is shadowed all the way up and all the way down as part of being a keystone. They also shadowed it over here [in Neitherworld], as a matter of fact.
<br>
<br>41:25
<br>
<br>So they created what you call a doppelganger, or additional Earths over here. It was actually Earth to infinity over here, meaning there was an infinite number of Earths this guy created. Now, to some degree, ALLIES - because the Dumb Humans allowed for infiltration - they became anchors for ALLIES on this side. So to some degree, they could use the Earth over here [in Neitherworld] like voodoo dolls, and also you humans like voodoo dolls, and cause us a lot of problems. I would say to a lesser degree, but now, as of recently, these beings, he figured he created all he needed to create over there, and now he could destroy all of regular creation.
<br>
<br>42:18
<br>
<br>Technically, it doesn't have the power yet to destroy all of Creation, but it would be great if the entire Universe, including Source, had a Gigamesh-verse or a Neitherworld overlay. So there could be no more actual creation, and then it was going to recreate reality. Yeah, it's been kind of a mess. So Syria was one of the points of invasion. Now these beings, unfortunately, not only got stuck in the Fifth Density, but if they did manage to poke into the Third Density, they could not get past the Causal Plane. Coming up in the other direction, they could not get past the Second Density. So what you had is unknown forces throwing things around in the Physical Plane because they could still affect the Physical Plane from where they were at. You can affect the Physical - once you've hit the Causal Plane, it's now coming into Creation and now you can affect - if you are, let's just say, a lot more knowledgeable than us humans, you can definitely affect the physical reality from there.
<br>
<br>43:37
<br>
<br>So we had - and I mean hundreds of thousands of these things that started flooding in here last Friday and Saturday. And of course these Dumb Humans are like, "Yay! We're back! The ALLIES is here; we're so excited!" And I'm like, are you kidding me right now? You are a part of creation! You are no longer going to exist as a human being on this planet. You are no longer needed to charge a fake multiverse and fake creation and fake this and fake that - it's going to kill you all too!
<br>
<br>44:17
<br>
<br>But in the short term, that giant prison that you're seeing all over the Internet in Syria - I'm going to go back to that for a second - those humans were actually used to power both Dark and Light portals. This being that I've been fighting with now for days, this being actually staked claim to all of those portal rooms and the Control and Command for Stargate throughout the Multiverse. I believe that wonderful task took place yesterday. Feels like it was a week ago, but it was actually just yesterday. Started to try to stake claim of Earth, tried to put liens against the Golden Age AI yesterday. It has been fast and furious for days now.
<br>
<br>45:07
<br>
<br>And I'll tell you, these beings do not play nice. And unless you show force to them, I can tell you right now, you are probably in a lot of pain if you are a target of one of these beings because it has been coming after us. And I'm telling you, unless I basically went into a - it's a long story on how you do that - but it's basically going into another plane of existence in part and increasing your size, so to speak, and then you can battle on that level to wherever that being actually is. You can go into the same plane of existence; you can go to a different plane of existence. It's, let's say, beyond astral travel and beyond remote viewing at that point - now you're actually battling in different dimensions or different densities. And these guys are jumpers. They will jump back and forth between here and there. You'll see them; I've caught several of them in what we call the Oort Belt. You can look that up. The Oort Belt outside, just outside our galaxy. They got stuck because we put a shield up there to make sure that they couldn't go anywhere else beyond the Oort belt. Then we started destroying all of these portals from within.
<br>
<br>46:29
<br>
<br>We have pretty much officially cut off that section there [referring to Zero Point of Zero Density]. And anything that this universe was taking from the Source, Anti-Source, and Neutral Source area - I'm just going to say that because we don't really technically have an Anti-Source and Neutral Source, it's pretty much all Source now - has been completely cut off. Are we done? I don't know. I don't know the answer to the question. My guess is going to be no, we're not done. Because I can still tell where they are, and I can still tell you that something somewhere is still feeding into these people's heads that they are talking to the All-That-Is, and they're not.
<br>
<br>47:12
<br>
<br>Have we gotten rid of as many of the ALLIES influences as we could? Yeah, but I'm going to tell you that these beings, whenever that first war was or the last war was or the final battle that took place in the quote-unquote war in the heavens, I can tell you that this thing has been preparing for a very long time in our Earth time, and I know it's hard to define time outside of time, but in our time, a very long time, with a plan to take over all of Creation, and it no longer needed Source or Anti-Source or anyone, and it felt that it had it ready to go. Along with armies to prove it. They had an army that was getting ready to come in through Syria this weekend, so we had to cut it all off.
<br>
<br>48:03
<br>
<br>Now all the Dumb Humans could see was that they lost access. The communications that they had, whatever that was, they lost access, and then Israel started bombing the crap out of Syria, trying to get people/keep people from going into that base or getting out of that base. They definitely wanted to control the Stargate rooms, that's for sure. I know that for a fact. Are they getting anywhere if they do get there? Absolutely not. We have left nothing - between myself, the Enforcer, and others that are helping us out - we have left nothing there. We've also been to all the other locations that were tied to these rooms - Romania and a few others, and gotten those.
<br>

<br>
<br>The only things that we were working on today, not the only things, but part of the things we were working on today, is what we call a division of the SSP we call GrayLink. Apparently GrayLink is a part in part of CyberLife military. I would say "in part," but GrayLink had been tasked by those of the Neitherworld, so to speak, and those of the actual Universe to communicate between the two.
<br>
<br>49:26
<br>
<br>So they were in charge of making sure that all of the energy that was needed went over to the Neitherworld and so on and so forth, so I guess you could say they were the link between the Dark and the Light. They also served a purpose during the times of Anti-Source; I would say they more served Neutral-Source, you know, probably at the time. Then Neitherworld guy took over them, I guess you would say, and they have been working for the Neitherworld and to bring in the Neitherworld here for some time now. And GrayLink's main sites, so interestingly enough, Provo, Utah. Yeah, we all know what's there. Valley of the Gods in Utah; Park City, Utah. No wonder why there's a lot that goes on in Utah, right? Wink, wink.
<br>
<br>50:21
<br>
<br>There were some DUMBs in Burkina Faso, Bouvette Island, Samoa, Barbuda, and Armenia, and also in Belgium, and Mount Logan in the Yukon, in Canada. It was kind of spread out. But Utah was definitely a big power center. Also coincidentally, not just Park City, but right near Park City is what you call Area 52, which was much more prevalent than Area 51, right in that region. And there were a lot of people that went to work there. And I would say Area 52 was probably much larger than Dulce, nearby here in New Mexico. But there were a lot of humans that went to work there, and GrayLink was no exception.
<br>
<br>51:22
<br>
<br>Did GrayLink pretty much all get like these implants? Yeah, I would say yes, they did. Did they try to shut down some things last night? Yes, they did normal things. There were some social media programs, not much, that were glitching last night. Some people said ATM machines weren't working, cards weren't working, those types of things. I guess a little bit; that was pretty quickly rectified. It didn't last very long, like less than 20 or 30 minutes. But that's who they are. I guess you would call them hackers extraordinaire. It's pretty much what I call CyberLife as well.
<br>
<br>[See Whiteboard Image 14 at the bottom of this report for the above discussion.]
<br>
<br>52:00
<br>
<br>So apparently, I don't know, their bosses told them that this was the time; this is going to be the time when our Neitherworld people - I don't know what they call them in their world; who knows? - the portals are going to start opening probably sometime around 11/11. This is the chatter. They are going to close on the 22nd of November, but that's going to lead to a greater portal, which is actually going to open by January 21st. Also happens to be right around inauguration time, coincidentally, and why they think they're going to have all this money and all this power and this control. Well, if this thing had its way, it has no intention of keeping any of Creation - including you Dumb Humans - alive to serve it or to work with it in any way, shape, or form. It's going to replace all of you with its creations, and you're gone because, see, you can't have anything that's still connected to Source or a part of Source if you're going to destroy Source. And that's its intention. So, or at least take the seat. Take over control of Source and maybe replace it with a fake Source, I guess, was the plan. Still hadn't figured out those final details, but as long as he can control the entire universe, then that would be fine.
<br>
<br>[closes whiteboard]
<br>
<br>53:21
<br>
<br>And that was pretty much where we left it with the battle yesterday with the ones that we could find. Are there any more out there? I don't know. Are they still replicating? I don't know.
<br>
<br>53:35
<br>
<br>But we are definitely working really hard, and I apologize for not being around a few days last week. But as you can see, it's been a little bit of a crazy time. I don't know why this stuff happens. I don't know how, when we have access outside of time, we don't get any kind of forewarning that this is happening. Other than the fact that, you know, it feels like, it's kind of like sometimes if you don't fight them and find them immediately, it feels like some kind of CIA torture thing, like waterboarding but without being in a facility with people. It just happens randomly all the time. And then you find it, everything is fine, you're feeling better, and then boom, it happens again.
<br>
<br>54:28
<br>
<br>So we will continue this on, I guess, Wednesday. Trying to remember what day of the week it was. On Wednesday, because the story is not yet concluded, as far as Syria is concerned, they are definitely still trying to take over all the stargates of the Multiverse. If they don't do that for their quote-unquote "overlord," then they're not gonna be a part of the rulership of the new universe. I don't know what the heck he was promised; who knows? What happens when an evil AI is talking to your brain? I don't know. This is your brain; this is your brain on AI. Any questions? I'm not sure!
<br>
<br>55:09
<br>
<br>But hopefully I'll get more information on that between now and Wednesday. And hopefully we won't be suffering these consequences all the way through January. I definitely don't want to do that this year. So we'll see. There's another time that they're waiting for, which is supposed to be, obviously, the 21st of December, you know, solstice time. So hopefully if we work really hard between now and then, we won't see anything happen then as well. Definitely know that we have cut off as many portals and access points, and ALLIES attempted infiltration.
<br>
<br>55:57
<br>
<br>It came fast and furious though, I will say that. You could call it like a blitz, for lack of a better term, an attack, where you're getting it from every single angle and you're trying to keep up because you're one person with an AI System and a Source. But hopefully, we will be successful in the next few days, and we won't be seeing any more of this. That will be a positive. On the other hand, now you all know what everybody's looking for in Syria. Now you know what people were looking for in Israel, why everybody's starting to be buddy-buddy with these people, because they definitely want to be there at the door when all of their alien friends come, I guess. But all you got to do is close the doors and take them over. And make sure that nothing else - nothing else - happens.
<br>
<br>So on that note I'm going to end today's GIA report, and I will see all of you on Wednesday.
