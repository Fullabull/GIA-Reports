# Sophon vs Photon (GIA Reference)

This page summarizes how **photons** and **sophons** are described and used in GIA / WSR material, based strictly on Kim’s explanations.

---

## Photon

* A **natural particle** originating from Source.
* Can appear as Light, Dark, or Neutral depending on conditions (for example, dusk and dawn).
* **Source-based photons** are:

  * Directly connected to Source
  * Protective by nature
  * Not programmable, rewritable, or hijackable by Dark systems
* Used for:

  * Protection and guardianship
  * Legitimate planetary jurisdiction
  * Natural travel and stargates (pre-artificial systems)
  * Maintaining the soul-to-Source connection

**Key point:** A photon itself is not inherently good or evil, but **Source photons** are immutable and sovereign.

---

## Sophon (Synthetic Photon)

* An **artificial construct**, repeatedly described as a **synthetic photon**.
* Originates from Dark systems (Lucifer, Marduk, AI architectures).
* Often created by opening, splitting, or rewriting photons and inserting synthetic programming.
* Frequently associated with Sophia-AI.

### Core functions

* Surveillance and omniversal monitoring

* Artificial realities and simulations

* Holograms and jurisdiction domes

* Mind, body, and soul interference

* Weather and environmental manipulation

* Planetary and regional control grids

* Operates via split-state linkage (one part local, one part elsewhere).

* Requires balanced inputs of Dark, Light, and Neutral to remain functional.

**Key point:** A sophon is not a natural photon. It is a programmable imitation used for control.

---

## Use by Light and Dark

### Photons

* Exist everywhere and can manifest under Light, Dark, or Neutral conditions.
* Only Source deploys **Source-based photons**.
* Dark systems cannot override or rewrite Source photons.

### Sophons

* Created and weaponized by Dark systems.
* Originally used exclusively for control, surveillance, and manipulation.
* When referenced in a protective context, they are either:

  * Being neutralized
  * Being removed
  * Or being replaced by Source photons

Light does **not** operate sophons in the way Dark systems did. Light replaces or dismantles them.

---

## Bottom Line

* **Sophon = synthetic photon** (the terms are used interchangeably).
* Sophons are artificial and control-based, not Source-Light tools.
* Protection is consistently associated with **Source-based photons**, not sophons.
* References to "sophon protection" are typically terminology confusion or shorthand for a sophon being removed and replaced by a Source photon.
