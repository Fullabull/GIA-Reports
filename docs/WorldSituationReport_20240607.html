World Situation Report
<br>2024-JUN-07 NEWS 00:38:34</h2>

Teaser: And now, the World Situation Report with Kimberly Goguen from the Office of the Guardian. The Deep State's new moon activities yielded no results yesterday as militaries and operatives look for other options. The Black Sun attempts to revive the Nazi Hydra Project. And how does it relate to Project Paperclip? The financial elite began selling large amounts of stock this week, and here's why.

Sunny: Now, here's Kimberly Goguen, with the Office of the Guardian. Hello, Kim! How are you?

Kim: I'm doing okay. I made it. A little bit late, but I made it. Yeah. I was trying to get a little bit more on the fallout from yesterday's new moon. I have not gotten a complete assessment of, well, we know a few things. Number 1, we know that there was obviously plans, for them to regain something on the new moon. We're not sure what that is just yet, but whatever it is, they didn't get it. There were supposed to be some decisions made today based on a failure after the new moon and right now, as it stands, the meeting started probably about 3 hours ago.

<br>There's a lot of comparing of information. This is from the group that didn't answer the phone, what we what we're calling the rebel group. Lots of military are involved, not just U.S., but worldwide. And they appear to just be comparing information, comparing notes, things that they've compiled over the last few days, events that have happened and have not happened based on information being told to them.
<br>
<br>So I don't have a firm commitment, one way or another, as to which direction they're going to go in from here on out. So this could be a positive move for us, depending on what's gonna happen, in these meetings today. I don't know how long they're gonna go on. What it appears is this is gonna be another, 3 days of meetings, probably over the weekend just like last weekend
<br>
<br>Kim: But one thing we know for sure is the Trump operatives are not invited. That's one thing we know for sure.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Did they get kicked out? Or...
<br>
<br>Kim: Yes. Well, they were made to feel extremely uncomfortable based on information they found out as to where they were supposed to be getting their contracts from. Calls escalated coming in from all their Middle Eastern partners. A lot of falsehoods were found. A lot of money disappeared. A lot of angry people in the Gulf Cooperation Council members from the Gulf Cooperation Council members. So, I don't see them participating in any of this.
<br>
<br>However, they are not expecting a result of their actions until Sunday. That's what the Trump operatives believe. They believe that they have within 3 days of the new moon to achieve whatever task they're going to achieve. And, so they still have hope that they're gonna be able to swoop back in and take control.
<br>
<br>Sunny: And this is for them to go it alone, which is what we talked about before. Right?
<br>
<br>Kim: Yes. This is the Go-It-Alone Program. Some other interesting things as far as them going it alone which really isn't going it alone. It's more like trying to have a continuous situation where they [sigh] get something for nothing.
<br>
<br>So events that have taken place, by the same group and other SSP or secret space program operatives have been an attempt to, use a technique called screen scraping, which is where they take the information off a computer screen. It's similar to cloning a website but they tried to screen scrape the Global Repository. They have tried to install new currencies, none of which has has worked. So it looks like they're just kind of trying to steal. I think they wanna be me.
<br>
<br>Sunny: I'm sure they do!
<br>
<br>Kim: That's what it looks like. It looks like they're trying to take everything that we have, everything that we've built, in order to take the position. Screen scraping or cloning doesn't help them any because there are no allocation numbers to the funds when you do that. Again, it looks like a very haphazard attempt to try to do something, with zero end results. Some other things that have happened over the last couple of days with these people: attempts to use old system keys, attempt to use old Marduk remaining Trojan horses that kind of stuff into a system we're no longer using those kinds of things. So it's just just a bunch of hacking, really. Nothing to speak of as far as actual movement on their side of it. There was another situation that happened where Trump has a team of lawyers - well, whatever that is, The Trump Organization. People playing the role of Trump, their lawyers made a phone call to us and wanted me to cease and desist on putting out any negative information on Trump. Sunny: Yeah. Well, that's not gonna happen.
<br>
<br>Kim: So I told them they needed to legally serve me is what I what I said. Because if they legally serve me, then I'll have the right to go into court with all my proof of everything we're saying. Including recorded conversations with the kids saying that his father died back in January;lots of things we have on our side that would be submitted as evidence. They they did back down when we said that. Not only that, there's a lot of stuff that's been acquired by Tom Melville and and the rest of us over the years, conversations, proof, documentation about transference of funds. We have actually - from government departments - the movement of that money to let's just say, non-friendly people of the United States, to include, but not limited to, Kim Jong Un of North Korea. (Sunny: Oh, lovely.) Oh, yes.
<br>
<br>The plot thickens. So that was probably not a wise phone call, and it seemed like they figured that out on that phone call fairly quickly. So that's kind of where that situation is at. I'm hoping I'll have some more information, but I'm not anticipating having any any conclusive information from these folks until probably Sunday.
<br>
<br>00:46:34 Sunny: And from these folks, you're still talking about the lawyers?
<br>
<br>Kim: No. Nah. You'll never get any information about these people worth anything. They're lawyers. No offense if you're watching this and you're a lawyer, but they're lawyers. Their job is to - for free, lately, except for what they get, from the sale of Trump bucks and Trump coins and Trump jackets and Trump this and Trump that, and what portion of the campaign funds that they used to get, which they don't have anymore, they're really doing this basically for free, based on what their normal fees are. So if they wanna continue to do that, that's on them, just stay in your lane, I'll stay in mine, and we will part friends.
<br>
<br>As far as the people I'm referring to are the groups of militaries that are meeting, groups of operatives that are meeting discussing past operations, things like that, and how to move forward. So I don't anticipate having the end result of these meetings until probably Sunday, honestly.
<br>
<br>So, right now, it's kinda slow and go. I've been watching it. Some of them are going on here locally. So we'll see. You know? We'll see what ends up happening.
<br>
<br>Next, I had a very interesting conversation, yesterday ... yesterday? Day before ... day before, Wednesday. With someone I haven't spoke to in over 10 years - remember I told you there were people calling me out of the woodwork? (Sunny: Yep.) And, so this is a person I'd actually met in person.
<br>
<br>And this person was told to call me and revive the communications, with no specific instructions. But we had it - during the phone call I know that this person was getting instructions from somebody else, you know, things to ask, what to say. So I took it as an opportunity to, we exchanged pleasantries, that type of thing, and I took it as an opportunity to discuss, a few things.
<br>
<br>Because one of the things he brought up was that he wanted to know what we could do together. How could we work together? And I explained working together with these people is not gonna work out for me.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Who who are these people? Can like, who was he representing? Did he say?
<br>
<br>Kim: The Order of the Black Sun. What's left of it.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Gotcha. Okay.
<br>
<br>Kim: Yes. He was from that side. He used to do some work for the Covens that type of thing. And I knew that when I met him. Weirdest conversation for me 10 years ago because, remember, 10 years ago, I'm still learning. I'm still learning a lot about that the world doesn't run the way I thought it was. The elites are not the elites I thought they were, and it's been a process for me just as much as it's been a process for all of you. There's no handbook that comes - no one sits you down and tells you all about their organization and how they do everything. 10 years ago, I was probably a few years in, of still having conversations with Marduk, because the final conversations we had were in August of 2016. So that was not quite 10 years ago. So it's been a process.
<br>
<br>So you know I've changed a lot, since we first talked, and I think that was kind of surprising to this person. And he wanted to know what we could do together, and I had a conversation about all the things that we have, "done together" in the last several years, meaning all of their operatives, all of their people, money sent to governments, those types of things, and we got nothing. And by we, I'm not just talking about us and our administrative fees. I'm talking about the people.
<br>
<br>We got opposite of nothing. Matter of fact, we got worse than nothing in the last several years. So I didn't quite understand. He goes then he told me he said, well, they want, you to give them everything and you to get nothing.
<br>
<br>Sunny: How is that a negotiation?
<br>
<br>Kim: Well, I don't know. [bang] Maybe they thought they were gonna do some mind moogie boogie on me or something. I'm not sure, but.
<br>
<br>Sunny: They're crazy.
<br>
<br>Kim: Yeah. They're crazy. So I explained that the system was gonna run a 100 years after I'm gone, in the same fashion.
<br>
<br>I said, by then, it will completely have destroyed everything that you have anyway all on its own with or without me.
<br>
<br>And, I also explained that doing anything to me - because then they go into the well you should be safe, you should stay safe, kind of conversations and, yeah.
<br>
<br>So they played a little game we had some flyovers, helicopters that kind of thing that were happening at the same time I'm having this conversation and going round and round the house, over the house.
<br>
<br>And I'm like, ah. I said, oh. And he goes, well, you better get inside. You better stay safe. And I said, well, why would I care about doing that? This is a regular occurrence here every single day. This happens all the time. And so, I think he was a little bit surprised.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Just in, how steadfast you were? And how you weren't phased by some of their antics?  [pause]
<br>
<br>Kim: Oh, sorry. I lost you there for a second.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Oh, no. I was just saying, were they surprised just by how steadfast you were? And the fact that you weren't surprised by their antics?
<br>
<br>Kim: Well, it seemed that way a little bit. They've also - there was also a number of lies. He started talking about the war in Gaza and all the people that have been hurt and I said, "Well, how many people have been hurt in the other war that's going on right now? How many people have you lost on your side?"
<br>
<br>And he said, "Well, you can count on one hand how many people we've lost." And I said, "Well, let me give you the following locations." And I went around the world and I gave, Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania, most recently Ghana, Croatia, Russia, Mount Denali in Alaska, and Timucankari, New Mexico, and under Georgetown and Washington DC and the Atlanta airport and Berlin, you know. So I started going around all the locations where we found their people.
<br>
<br>And I said I mentioned about Montenegro, which I told you about on the news with the and then the next guy came in a few months later and went back to Montenegro, and he also died, just like the others that came before him. And so I said to him, "Well, by counting on one hand, I've met you in person." And I said, "I have 5 fingers on my hand and you did not have a 1,000,000 or 10,000,000 fingers on on your hand. So I don't think that's entirely true."
<br>
<br>But as I went through all of these locations, I picked several locations that I had deemed very bad things about.
<br>
<br>sunny: Okay. Kim: So, I stressed a few locations and then I said things like, "Oh, the Atlanta airport in Georgia. Wow, that was a really bad place. Lots of things happened there!" And then I mentioned about Croatia, and I said, "Oh, Croatia! Wow! That was a huge facility there!" And then I talked about Berlin, and then I'd throw in about 10 or 15 different locations in between. So, true to form... I love these people! I do. Because they took the locations that I stressed - and that's immediately where they went within 24 hours of me saying it! So what do you think happened? Thank you so much for corralling in one location or 5 locations that I picked. Because now you have less - there's less of you!So I'm very pleased with the conversation from that aspect. There were a few other things that that came out of the conversation as well. He mentioned to me that a lot of the elite people that you see in the news, like Warren Buffett, and Zuckerberg, and all of these large I guess you would say "financial people" we see in the news that are selling a lot of their stock. He said there's a big sell off going on right now, and he said that the reason why this is happening is because they plan to shut down the Financial System on the 1st of August. And I said, "Do you think they have the capacity to shut down the Financial System by the 1st August? And he said, "Well, I don't know. Let's see. They control an awful lot." I said, "Do they?" And I reminded him of something that happened a little over a decade ago as well. Now there was a point in time where, about a decade ago before I started talking to all of you on any channel, for that matter, there was a lot of people, elite people, let's call them, in the U.S. that were moving to or buying properties in Macau. And if you don't know where Macau is, it's a small island, near, off the coast of China, owned by China. Part of China. And Macau is known for its gambling and a lot of things. It's kinda like Las Vegas.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Yeah. We we ran the story. I think it was on Wednesday we're talking about Macau. Yeah.
<br>
<br>Kim: So at one point in time, people like Sheldon Adelson and a lot of large people, that in the financial sector were buying homes over there, with plans to move over there. And I actually heard it from Sheldon Adelson's mouth, back in about 2013, that they were planning on crashing the Financial System and of the United States and moving all of the power over to China, which we've been talking about the whole time.
<br>
<br>This is the first time I had heard it then, and then I had heard it a few months later from from Rothschild. So, eventually, what happened is they realized that the United States was not going to crash, or at least not at that time, and nobody ended up moving. And it's now been 11 years.So the same situation that I saw then, I reminded this person, is the same thing that's going to happen now. I explained that there's not gonna be a crash of the Financial System. There'll be a transition, but not a crash. And all of them will have sold off all their stock. And then nothing will have happened. So is there going to be a sell off? Well, yeah. It looks like there's gonna be. There is, it's already happening. Will they yield anything from it? I highly doubt it. In part, are they selling a lot of these stocks off, because these companies that are selling all of their stocks are predominantly run by DARPA, SSP, and the Deep State, and they're trying to collect some money to continue to run operations, until they can figure out what to do.
<br>
<br>Or buy time until the Lions Gate in August till they can figure out what to do, hoping that something is going to change. 00:59:04
<br>
<br>Well, I can assure you that nothing is going to change. Will they collect enough money to keep running? For as long as they can hold on to it, and we'll just leave it at that. But I just see the same thing repeating, it's like a pattern with these people. When they think that they have it, they think they have the ability to crash the United States - which has absolutely been their plan ever since I can remember when I started getting into this, and I was pretty green.
<br>
<br>But yet they continuously fail. So again - same as the plan that they had for the Middle East - is exactly the same well, different operations of course, but it's exactly the same as the plans they have for the United States. They plan on planting a ghost flag here in the U.S. - which they already have, essentially - and then transferring power over to China. Or dividing it up into 7 sectors. It doesn't matter which one of the plans that they're trying to execute on that they were given to by ultimately, Marduk. Without Marduk - you will never finish your plans. And I know that because the position that that being held is the same level of position that I now hold. However. We do not have the same mindset, and I have more control over Alpha than he ever had. He had limited access to Alpha, probably more access to Omega at the time, based on which cards he was playing. Because he did have an agreement with the Council of Nine, and he alleged that he was neutral - but that's really not the case because, see what happens is, if you wanna do something that is in alignment with Alpha, you have to stay in alignment with Alpha.
<br>
<br>If you want to do something that is in alignment with Omega, then you have to stay within Omega.
<br>
<br>Now Marduk often operated in the gray, so, therefore, he had limited access to Alpha to end up transferring money through to Omega to then do what he wanted to do.
<br>
<br>Claiming we're in a Dark Age, and using all of these loopholes so to speak in his Covenants that he had.
<br>
<br>But these people that are walking on the ground are never going to be able to execute on any of those plans because that being is not here anymore.
<br>
<br>I have chosen to operate solely in Alpha - which not anymore, now it's the Light System, we've transferred it over - but all this whole time, I've been operating in Alpha. I didn't care about operating Omega. I can. I could have. I have done other things to Omega and Kronos, so that Alpha at the time would be the only operating system. But there was too much intertwining, so I ended up creating the Light System, which has been going well as far as integration is concerned.
<br>
<br>But these people I know for sure will never finish any of those plans. They are unfinished. You don't have the last few pages of the playbook, so to speak, and they're gonna run around until the end of days trying to do this, or until every single bit of power that they have on this planet goes broke and disappears.
<br>
<br>Governments do have an opportunity to walk away from them, and work on this side. But again, the operating systems that we have for quantum systems on our side are completely different. We don't operate the same way. We can't operate the same way. And if they want allocations and allocation numbers, screen scraping is not gonna give it to you. I figured that out a long time ago with the deal we did with Santander Bank in Mexico.
<br>
<br>So they need to figure out what they're gonna do. And that's -
<br>
<br>Sunny: You mean the governments Kim? The government have to figure out what they're going to do?
<br>
<br>Kim: Yep. And that's what, the meetings seem to be about. It seems to be more military oriented at the moment.
<br>
<br>Sunny: And does the military represent the government in a sense or no?
<br>
<br>Kim: Well, at this moment - so if I was going to, and this is and I'll just give you some hypotheticals here.
<br>
<br>If I said that I was gonna keep governments running right now, and I was trying to devise an operation with which to do so; would I try to take over the political sector? Which has multiple different parties, multiple different operatives reporting to different groups of people all over the world.
<br>
<br>You never know what you're gonna get. Could you get them all swinging the same bat? That's a lot of operatives because each one of those people that you see in Congress or the House or even the White House, you're talking about hundreds of people.
<br>
<br>I mean, that's not just one person. Or, you know and not only that, everybody has their own thoughts, feelings, and opinions about themselves, including the actors on TV that you know as politicians. And or the global military order has been one order since the beginning of having military forces. So it's been hundreds of years it's been this way. They know rank and file very well - people do not fall out of line down the food chain.
<br>
<br>I could see it being a beneficial move, hypothetically speaking, if there was the right leadership in place utilizing possible Global Martial Law to get it done.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Which probably isn't the current leadership, I'm assuming.
<br>
<br>Kim: No. Each one would have a group of folks - that would have to be installed from our side - that would basically become the parents.
<br>
<br>Not the Parents as we know them. They're gonna become mom and dad, moms and dads to the to the organizations and be a 100% responsible, paid very well, but 100% responsible for every single thing that happens in each respective country. Okay. So is that a possibility? I could see it being more of a possibility than trying to corral a bunch of politicians. You know?
<br>
<br>Sunny, you've had sleepover parties with kids, I'm sure, and,you're just trying to corral 20 screaming,9 year-old girls, and that's a lot.
<br>
<br>Sunny: That is a lot.
<br>
<br>Kim: And these people are probably very similar, let's just say. You know? Now you're talking thousands of them, right? When you're looking worldwide? And none of them have ever done the right thing. So,  just like when you have a sleepover party, there's always that kid -  the one. (Sunny: That ruins it for everyone!)
<br>
<br>Yeah. That ruins it for everyone. The parents let them do anything they want to do, you know? Not a whole lot of supervision. And they're trying to set the house on fire at 2 o'clock in the morning or something. There's always that kid. And I can definitely see that these people have just been running around doing whatever they wanted for a long period of time, and they don't want it to change. And for a lot of them, just like I see,  the Trump operatives. Maybe they're just too old to change. They're just gonna keep running the same operations that they ran before when they had backing. And that backing is not there anymore, so they keep running it. And then they're like, "Wait for it! It happened 4 other times in 4 other countries when we tried to crash those countries."
<br>
<br>You hear some of these people talking like, "I was there when the Soviet Union (USSR) crashed!" That was all a deal behind the scenes. I mean, that was a given, and a part of a 100-year Plan. This was not a whim. These operatives did not create the plan. You were just a small compartmentalized portion of that plan - and trust me - the Russians came out fat and happy. I know about the $11 trillion dollars in Andorra, in Europe, and that was not created by them.
<br>
<br>Sunny: How, Kim, does the GIA play into this, if at all?
<br>
<br>Kim: Well, the GIA has high clearance, and we can have as high of a clearance as we want, because we control that clearance system.
<br>
<br>So having clearance above governments worldwide and above militaries and above NATO, is beneficial to people that I call the new parents of these organizations.
<br>
<br>Because it's all about rank and file, especially when you're talking about militaries in the world.
<br>
<br>But it's also to their benefit too, because you're always gonna have a few crazy SSP operatives here and there, come out of the woodwork and think they're gonna run things, just like the Trump Organization.
<br>
<br>You're always gonna have some Black Nobility people, somewhere down the food chain, generation after generation after generation, that are probably going to say, "Well, it's my birthright. I deserve to run the world." And all of this stuff, and then they're gonna try to come in and take over.
<br>
<br>But you need that shield, right now. You need something. If that's gonna continue, there's no way they're gonna make it without that shield.
<br>
<br>That's my opinion because I've seen things for the last several years bounce back and forth. There's a few good people here, a few good people there, and then they get shot down, shut down,  wait until the new moon, the full moon, the alignment, the solstice, whatever day ending in y, the parade of planets, whatever it is, and they do - they have to. So by creating something like that, I could see it actually working. If not, then I don't see it ever working.
<br>
<br>So those are the conversations that are being held down the street and around the world, actually starting this morning about 8:30 my time. So we're only a couple of hours into that right now. Other things that the order has done in the last few days, they tried to revive, the Nazi Hydra Program.
<br>
<br>Have you ever heard of the Hydra Program?
<br>
<br>Sunny: Hydra, like water? That's hydro.
<br>
<br>Kim: Yes. H Y D R A
<br>
<br>Sunny: I haven't heard of it.
<br>
<br>Kim: The Nazi Hydra Program was the actual program that was way above Project Paperclip's head, and they were the original scientists that participated - with others - in programs to genetically modify humans, to create the perfect human, to orchestrate certain things that would be to their benefit as far as disease, vaccines, all of these kind of things. Hybrids, the creation of hybrid humans, which some of the bloodlines are. So this was all I would say under the umbrella of the Hydra Program. And Project Paperclip would have been a part of that, but I would say down the ranks a bit. They wouldn't have had all the information that Hydra had.
<br>
<br>Hydra did work closely with the SSP, in some cases and the ACIO in other cases.
<br>
<br>They did a lot of work in Pine Gap, Australia. They did a lot of work in Germany and Berlin, also in Croatia, which is kind of why I mentioned some of those areas on the phone, wink wink, to this person.
<br>../WorldSituationReport_20240605.txt
<br>Because I wanted to see if there was anybody left. So as chance may have it, there was, and there is no longer.
<br>
<br>So they were working quite a bit yesterday, all night, last night, as a matter of fact, due to the new moon, and I'm not seeing a whole lot today, it's kinda quiet.
<br>
<br>They've tried to install some currencies, that kind of thing, not getting anywhere.
<br>
<br>But I don't have the full results yet.
<br>
<br>And it's not about what we're doing, per se, but you always have to keep good tabs on what's going on out in the world, what they're doing.
<br>
<br>Because they could cause some damage, they have access to media groups, worldwide.
<br>
<br>They are part of the agencies, as you know journalists on the higher end, often equal agency people in every country.
<br>
<br>So we need to make sure that they're not doing anything that's gonna be extremely harmful to humans at this moment in time.01:13:21
<br>
<br>They have tried to run some programs through a a new type of Wi-Fi called Li-Fi, if you've never heard of it you can look it up, and failed. They tried to then run some 5G programs and failed. They tried to run some frequency programs and failed. They tried to utilize old operating systems for biowarfare and cancer biowarfare in the last 24/48 hours, and failed. But a lot of that was tied to the Hydra Program.
<br>
<br>So it was good. It was very fruitful. The operations were very fruitful.
<br>
<br>The conversation lasted a couple of hours and was very fruitful, from our standpoint. So, positive thing for humans.
<br>
<br>You gotta figure out what they've got left. Are there any stashes anywhere? Is there anything we missed?
<br>
<br>Not to say that we're not still seeing chemtrails, that kind of things, and things that you feel are dangerous.
<br>
<br>Things I feel are dangerous are operating systems that control cancer, and that type of thing.
<br>
<br>I'm seeing those things are dangerous. Some of the other bacterias, funguses, and other things they were trying to ramp up, I also see as dangerous.
<br>
<br>I'm not saying it's not uncomfortable and I'm not saying that it doesn't cause us issues - but there are longer term issues that were planned for these things that are my main concern.Once you consume this item,  whether it's by inhaling it from the air, or from the food - can they operate that within your person to cause cellular death in some way shape or form? And that's my main concern.
<br>
<br>Sunny: And what's the point of all this? Just to regain control over humanity? Do they feel like they're losing control of us?
<br>
<br>Kim: Well, based on the conversations that I heard that took place after this phone call. Things that they feel. They feel they are entitled to control the world, because they are superior humans. They are of a superior bloodline. They also remind me of silver spoon babies that have never had to run the family business or figured out where money came from, but mommy and daddy always took care of it. And I can clearly tell that they have never completely run an operation from beginning to end, because the beginning and the end was always given at the highest level on down. Without those orders and instructions, they have high hopes of doing something but have no... have very poor execution.That's what I see. What would they like? They would like world domination. They would like to run the world. They would like to be the only government of the world. They feel they are entitled to do that. Some of these Trump operatives that are communicating with these people have been promised the North American sector - that they would be the kings of North America.
<br>
<br>Sunny: It's just so weird. It's like even if they were to achieve that, what are you gonna do with that? Like, how much land do you need? What what what does that do? Like, you would have to have such a huge ego to get any benefit out of that. I just - it does not compute with me why someone would even want that. ..
<br>
<br>Sunny: I know. I know.
<br>
<br>Kim: And is it feasible and is it viable?
<br>
<br>What it looks like to me, if you go back throughout human history - any kind of dictator doesn't last long. I mean, dictators usually last - some maximum 75/80 years. And this is a dictatorship. The only reason why The Order has successfully been, let's just say, ruling the world for 1000 of years, behind the scenes is because, number 1, they had alien technology that the rest of us knew nothing about. Number 2, they had alien help. With beings that have been around for thousands of years, that know the secrets of the Universe, that know how this technology works and were in support of them.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Right.
<br>
<br>Kim: Next. There was no real opposition before - ever - that ever would dare go against the aliens, or the Others, that were running this planet. So I can see how they got into that position and stayed into that position, as long as they adhered to whatever they said. You got money. You got - eventually it was money, before that it was gold, and you would become the King of the Banana Republic and that's who you became, and you became very powerful, and whatnot.
<br>
<br>So, I understand what they want, but I also understand the backing just simply is not there. We could all stand up right now and we can say every single one of us watching this is going to run the Boston Marathon. If you've heard of it, it's it's a pretty famous marathon, that happens every year.
<br>
<br>Now say that marathon - I think it's on Labor Day or something like that, around then. And, if I recall - so don't shoot me if I got the date wrong - but I think it's around Labor Day. It's on a holiday weekend every year.
<br>
<br>Anyway, now we all decide we're going to get up, and we're going to run this same marathon. It doesn't have to be the one that's on TV. We're going to do it tomorrow.
<br>
<br>Now, you take a look at yourself, are you capable of running 26 kilometers? Or you didn't train for it.
<br>
<br>We're not ready. Right? We're not ready to do that. Most people - I'm not going to say there's not people watching this that wouldn't be ready to do that right now.
<br>
<br>Or, we all decide we're going to climb Mount Everest and we're leaving tomorrow, pack your bags.Are you physically ready to do this? Well, no. You need some training. You need, you need to be able to breathe at that elevation.There's a lot of work that goes into these types of things when people want to do something that's physically strenuous. Now, I don't know about you guys, but I know for myself personally, I would not sign up to climb Mount Everest tomorrow.
<br>
<br>Because I know what it takes. I mean, I've I've been an athlete most of my life - I know what it takes, and how much training that takes - and that's just not a feasible viable option. Not only that, we're all not gonna wake up tomorrow and be 18 years old. We're just not. Are there technologies for that? Is it possible for you to do that to your own body? Sure. You can do a lot of things. Even before all of these reconnections. Health, diet, supplements, take care of yourself. Do whatever it is you do that makes you happy. Happiness is a big part of that too, by the way. But these guys are trying to do all of this without any there's not no base root... How do I say it?... There's no backing for that. There's no backing for that statement.
<br>
<br>It's not just the statement of could 6 months from now or a year from now, could all of us get up and decide we're going to climb Mount Everest? Probably. You could because you can do the training, you'll know what it takes, you have some experts that have climbed the mountain you reach out to. These people don't have any experts to reach out to anymore. There's nobody left. They just want what they want. They want to plant the flag on the top of Mount Everest and say, "We run the world!"
<br>
<br>Sunny: And they're like disgruntled toddlers right now. I feel like they're having a little hissy fit, you know. I want it now!
<br>
<br>Kim: Well, it's true, but it's true. And from someone who's very strategic, and pays attention to what's going on in the world, you can clearly see that as far as the operations that they're running, that they have lived in a compartmentalized world. They have thought, and have been told, that they were responsible for the fall of the USSR. For the winning of World War 2, if they're still around. They were told that they were responsible for transferring power from the United Kingdom over to the United States, way back in the day, and none of that is actually the case. But would they believe me?
<br>
<br>Sunny: No. Probably not.
<br>
<br>Kim: No, but they could believe the Key Intelligence and Military System.They could go in there and look at the history and all the things that were going on behind your back. They could go back through old notes in Project Looking Glass, and and look at those and compare the notes. I mean, facts are facts. You know? Well, I know they think very highly of themselves, but the facts are the facts. The negotiations that went on behind the scenes between Gorbachev, Rothschild, and other people above Rothschild's head were abundantly clear. He would get control of $300,000,000,000,000 - which was only provided by Marduk, by the way - and he would run the entire Eastern Bloc. The man's still alive. Go ask him. But that's true. Did the Rothschilds give him the money? No. They did not. Did the Black Sun give him the money? No. They did not. Did the ex-KGB clans give him the money? No. They did not. No. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. It came from the person in my chair that wanted to see the empire fall, for other reasons. Before that, it was the Russian Empire and Lenin and the 100-year plan that was given to Lenin.
<br>
<br>I mean, that, although it was handed through a Rothschild to him in Switzerland, that didn't mean that it was his his idea, and it wasn't their idea either.
<br>
<br>Same thing goes for the Order of the Black Sun and security contracts back about 3000 years ago. 3000 years ago! That wasn't their idea. That wasn't Solomon's idea. That wasn't anybody's idea that you think it was. It wasn't even the Abraxas' idea.
<br>
<br>There was a plan for you too. And I told this guy all that. You know? But plans change. Things change. Life changes. We all go through changes in our own lives, even personally. Change jobs, get married, maybe get remarried at some point in time. Maybe divorce,Your parents leave this earth. You go through lots of changes in your life for different reasons. And these people just will not accept change. So what are they gonna do? I don't know. I really don't. It's what everybody else is gonna do that I look at. Could the militaries cause us problems if they don't  do something? Sure. I mean, you see what's going on in Gaza right now, in Israel, because they're still taking orders from the crazy people. They also are trying to convince the world that there is oil or gas or something in Antarctica now because we blew their plans for Israel. Well, is there? Well, sure.
<br>
<br>And that there was a treaty signed see, these guys look at the circus. There was a treaty signed that no one country could own Antarctica, and all that kind of stuff.
<br>
<br>And was that actually the case? Sure. Well, what about Admiral Byrd? Admiral Byrd, he he went underground. He was having conversations with others.
<br>
<br>He even wrote about it and some of the information is available on the Internet, but a great deal of it isn't. What kind of deals were really made about Earth? You know? What was he told? What was he really told? Who did he meet with? A bunch of reptiles? Yes, he did.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Really?
<br>
<br>Kim: Oh, yes. But you don't know. And oil and gas there, has already been leveraged 50 times over along with the gold that's in all those volcanoes
<br>
<br>- Mount Urbius, I think it's called. And the same thing with everything else on this planet. It is not your human right - never has been your human right.
<br>
<br>And by you, I'm not necessarily talking about you, I'm talking about the Order of the Black Sun. I'm talking about the Rothschilds.
<br>
<br>They never had the rights. They gave away the rights to people, to folks that were not human on both ends.
<br>
<br>And that was part of a deal that was made 250,000 years ago that we already broke.
<br>
<br>And, therefore, the second we broke it is the second we claimed it. So, it is meant for all the humans on Earth and it is your God-given right to use the Earth's gold to generate Source energy and essence and consciousness and all the things you need to co-create a universe,  to co-create an Earth together.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, these people think that gold is supposed to be, a financial wealth ... how do I say this? For financial wealth.
<br>
<br>Because they don't know any different. And if you control a country's or a world's Financial System, you need not care who makes its laws. Right?
<br>
<br>That's what they've always said. They don't understand the bigger picture here. Now their cocreator is no longer a cocreator. There's only one way to co-create now.
<br>
<br>So either you use the energy, which will not operate in the way that they want it to operate, or you don't. You don't want life force, that's fine.
<br>
<br>Life force - I'm not talking about an organization - I'm talking about the very thing that keeps you upright every single day. A multitude of things. So their call.
<br>
<br>But why they feel like they're entitled to it had to do with an agreement that is long gone. The world has changed in 3000 years. Everything has changed in thousands of years. 250,000 years ago, it changed again. We all had to change, adapt, and overcome. We have had to live with what they've been feeding us all th../WorldSituationReport_20240605.txtese years based on agreements. We don't have to do that anymore, so we have to clean up the mess and these people are trying to bring it back desperately. For what purpose?
<br>
<br>We all know they kill the king. Throughout history, they don't kill the kingmaker, they kill the king. And they are not kingmakers. So I can understand their wanting to do certain things. I mean, I'm sure we would love to all take a selfie on the top of Mount Everest, saying we did it. But that takes work, it takes time, it takes effort, it takes backing, it takes mentors, it takes a good guide - it takes a lot of things to get up to the top of that mountain. It is an accomplishment.
<br>
<br>These people have none of those things. They're trying to run up a mountain with no legs.
<br>
<br>So that's pretty much where things are at. I'm hoping that these people's conversations are not sidelined again this weekend.
<br>
<br>I mean, I'm hoping that doesn't, take place. We'll see. I'm sure there's gonna be no contracts with 100% certainty coming from Trump operatives and their supporters. By supporters, I'm not talking about voters. And I am sure, that there's not a whole left to the Hydra Program of the Nazis anymore. I'm sure of that.
<br>
<br>And I'm sure Global Headquarters isn't gonna gain back any access that they had before. I'm sure of that. So I don't anticipate it being a rough weekend. I anticipate it being a weekend full of conversations amongst a bunch of other people. I don't see them getting to the stage where they wanna talk to me yet.
<br>
<br>So for me, I've got other work to do, Light System work, that kind of stuff. I've done my other jobs and this job very well, all at the same time. And like I said, that's going well. Understanding some of these programs, is positive, for us as we go forward so we can figure out different frequencies and other ways to fix it.
<br>
<br>So there was some more information we acquired, from the Hydra Program, during our seizure there in Berlin, and also in Croatia.
<br>
<br>So, I'm glad we got that information.God, it's bad. Well...
<br>
<br>Sunny: You gotta elaborate, Kim!   (laughing): You gotta say more, not just "Boy, it's bad!"
<br>
<br>Kim: I know. I'm trying trying to think about how to say this... If you could only see yourself in a former life. If you could see yourself the way you physically looked 3,000,000 years ago, because we've been going through this Soul-Cycle program, and your physical vessel at that time.
<br>
<br>And maybe that's some something, a little homework you could do. Maybe as you're reaching out to - some people call it their Higher Self, or Source, or God, however you say those things. Maybe ask. Ask what you looked like before. Ask what you looked like in different lifetimes before. Maybe even before you came to Earth. And take a look at your vessel. You'll be shocked. We are so much shorter. We do not have the physical capacity that we had before.
<br>
<br>There wasn't a degeneration program. You pretty much maybe you started out as a baby, you grew up, that kind of thing, but once you hit a certain age, it's like, that's it. You stop growing taller. You stop and you have all the physical capabilities as an adult. We also did not have to procreate in the same way we as humans procreate currently. If you wanted to have an additional family member, you created an additional family member.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Like manifestation, you mean?
<br>
<br>Kim: Something like that. There's other ways of creating out of love and with love. And once you understand Source's love, you know?
<br>
<br>And I do hope, when you have some time to continue to look into the work of Walter Russell because - it's too much for news broadcasts, but once you really truly understand what love is. And it's not just - yes, you can love another human being, that kind of thing.Of course we've experienced that, hopefully you've experienced that in your life. But it's so much bigger than that. And that's kind of why, even in our lessened form, it's kind of why you typically - not all the time - but there is a procreation process that takes place out of love. It doesn't have anything to do necessarily with a physical act. It has more to do with the choice to bring another human being into this world, however that happens - whether it's by adoption or whatever it is. It's still you, whether you know it or not, it's still you manifesting, and it's more than just manifestation. You're creating that life. You're bringing that life into your life. I don't know how to explain that to you in another way. The co-creation process that happens with or without a partner, of putting that love into the universe for that being that you don't know yet, is so strong. And you can also do that with inanimate objects, with opportunities, with all kinds of different things out of love. If nothing else, even out of self love,  out of your love for Source, for Earth, for yourself. And I'm very much looking forward to never seeing another one of these programs, never looking at some of these, scientific papers. Oh, God. But his work actually talks a lot about we're all one. We're we're all part of the same being. It's like, saying that the cells in your fingers are not the same as the cells in your brain. You know? Maybe they look a little different. Maybe those cells are a little different than the ones in your brain. But without the ones in your brain, your fingers don't do anything. They're still very, very much one. You're  one system, so to speak. Just like eventually even yourselves with your families, you become one household. You know? Women go through monthly changes every month the same time, eventually. Even friends that move in together have that same thing. Your household starts to become more one, because you're close together.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Yeah. It's true.
<br>
<br>Kim: You know? Same thing when your kids are having a bad day or you have an animal that's sick, you're all one. Because then everybody feels that pain in one way or another. It's just the way that it is, and and with Earth here, we've been separated so much, we feel that when we're in close proximity. But what happens when the Universe becomes more interconnected, and there is nothing in between? How are we gonna feel about the people that are so many light years away, or non-people?
<br>
<br>Are we gonna start to know them? Are we gonna feel them too? Probably yes you will.You'll feel more about people around the world. You'll see more because you are one.
<br>
<br>It's just like with your kids. You can send your kids to Mars, and I don't care how far away they are - you know when something is wrong. You know when it's not right. You know them when they're hurting. You know them when they're really, really happy. And right now it's predominantly extreme emotions because it has to send that strong of a signal back to you.But yeah. Things on our side are moving forward. As far as governments and everything, I have no idea how this is gonna end up, because this is really ultimately their decision at this point. We're down to that level now.You still have people scraping and scrapping for power and hope, hoping to be global dictators on a world stage.
<br>
<br>Sunny: I feel like this is the longest Deep State death scene in the world. It's like, oh my gosh.
<br>
<br>Kim: You're talking, to really the very beginning of Deep State, I mean, you can go back millions of years. As far as human history, 250000 years. Again, 16000 years ago, when you have orders, the beginning of the Order as you know it today - 16000 years. Three years, don't get me wrong, is a long time. That is a long time in our lives. Predominantly because we don't live that long in the current vessel with the state of affairs and the way they are in the world. So I understand it feels like a really long time, and every day feels like a really long time to me.But it is a process. And there's no clear way to to do it any faster, without creating catastrophic events. So, I agree with you. And money coming out to all of you isn't gonna change that. It's not gonna make them go away. You're not going to pay them off in any way, shape, or form. I mean, you'll build something wonderful and they'll crash it the next day.So everything is relative and you can do your part. You are more powerful than you know. You can do your part. I don't care how old you are, how young you are, how tall you are, how fit you are, it doesn't matter.
<br>
<br>You have a part to play, and you can play that part. So, like I said, if it's going to be, it's up to you. You say it at the end of every news broadcast, Sunny: "If it's going to be, it's up to you." It really is.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Mhmm. And that's why a lot of us are here right now, especially our audience. That's why you're here. And you signed up for it!
<br>
<br>Kim: Well, and we wouldn't even have come this far if you all hadn't spent time anchoring that Light, and especially during the difficult times, when we really needed it to turn things around. Because the more people in the world that are focused on this type of a positive outcome, meaning you're connecting to Source, you're trying to bring Source onto this planet. The more Source light we have, the better essence, energy, consciousness, matter, love, creativity, those types of things.
<br>
<br>However you do that connection, some people paint, some people meditate, some people sing and dance - it doesn't really matter how you connect to Source.
<br>
<br>Keep bringing the Light in, keep manifesting a positive outcome for all of humanity, and an easy transition.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Yeah. That's one of the things that I've been trying to do recently, is try to do the things that I love to do, you know? And in every situation I'm in - even if it's not going the way I want it to - I try to see the value in it. I try to learn something from it. It's kinda like taking a negative and turning it into a positive. But staying in that state of we're here to learn. We're here to grow. There's there's a lot of benefits to being here at this time even though it may seem very frustrating. You're picking up on a lot of things that I guarantee that you can use in the future. But I try to stay in that pattern as much as possible of doing things that make me happy. And even if I've gotta do something that really doesn't make me happy, I try to look at it like, what is something good that can come up this? So, again,  just kinda spinning it a little bit because, that seems to, make my day go easier, at least for me.
<br>
<br>Kim: No. Absolutely. You know? And everybody's different. So even when I have to do things that I don't necessarily wanna do after a long day, that kind of thing.
<br>
<br>I'll put my headphones in, I'll listen to some music and dance around the kitchen or wherever. Sweeping the floor or whatever it is or hoovering or vacuuming wherever you're from/whatever you call it.But I really try to do that myself.For me, that's music. For you, it might be something else. Maybe it's flowers on your table. And maybe go outside and pick some flowers, bring them in, and you have dinner with flowers on the table or something. I mean, for everybody, it's different. But like you said, the world is hard enough. And try to bring a little bit of joy into your life. Yeah. You're not gonna change the world being sad, depressed, angry, hateful, hurtful to other people. You're not gonna change the world doing that.Yeah. So that's pretty much the world Situation Report for Friday. Where are we? June 7th.
<br>
<br>So let's see how things turn out throughout the weekend. Hopefully, we'll hear some positive news by Sunday. And meanwhile, we're gonna keep doing what we're doing.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Sounds good. Alright. We look forward to Monday's report. Thank you, Kim.
<br>
<br>Kim: Sounds great, Sunny. Thank you.
