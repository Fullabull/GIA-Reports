            <br>Operations Report
            <br>2026-Jan-24
        </h2>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;"> From the Office of the Guardian </h4>
        <br>
        <strong>
        <br>Coming up on today's Global Intelligence Agency Operations Report:
        </strong>
        <br>
        <br>At the Davos World Economic Forum, talks of wars and resources was the chatter behind the scenes, with no way to pay the bill. It looks like their economic plans have failed. Today, we will take a look into why it failed and what is next.
        <br>
        <br>Genetic shareholders, also known as the dynasty banking families, admit they can no longer prop up the banking system, and it looks like they have gone into self-preservation mode.
        <br>
        <br>The Nazi regime, also known as the operatives behind the Trump administration, are fighting hard to preserve their control structures as they rapidly disappear.
        <br>
        <br>And in a world full of black alchemy and Matrixes, where science reigns supreme over Source, Source begins to seep through the cracks to shine light for the first time in eons, as a whole new world begins to unfold.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:02:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Well, it's the 24th of January. We have been working hard, as always. I do want to make a couple of comments before I get started on the news. I hope you all enjoyed the interview with George. We should have a copy of it over the weekend, if not within the next couple of days. So we should have those up on our app as well.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:03:09</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>I know there have been a few people that have commented and said, why did I do the interview on Monday with George and haven't managed to get a report out in the last couple of days? So please understand that George has been asking me to do this for about six months. I've had to cancel once or twice on him, and I wanted to make sure that I was there this time. So I did everything I could, but I shuffled a lot of stuff around to make it happen, just as I have been lately with these reports.
        <br>
        <br>In addition to that, we did start this report a day ahead of time from today, which is now Sunday. And there is a lot happening at the moment - as there always is, I understand that. But sometimes there are things that you have to stop for, and yesterday was one of those days.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:04:17</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>I've been really trying to set aside as much time as I can to ensure that I can take about three or four hours to make some notes and to make sure that I'm informing all of you of everything that's really going on in this world, so that I can help you navigate. And that's my hope. I've learned to navigate a lot of things being here in the quote-unquote worst place on the planet. But hopefully, I can impart some wisdom as we finish this off, which I'm hoping is very soon.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:04:59</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>As for me, on other levels of things going on in my life, I still have to do life as a person once in a while. And as part of doing that life, the funeral for my friend was on Friday. And so I did speak with family members and friends, some of them mutual friends, at great length over the last couple of days. So I've taken some time to do that and see how things went. And obviously, I couldn't be there, and for that I am sorry that I couldn't be. But for the most part, he was a big part of my life and a very good friend for quite a long time. So it's, you know, to try and help other friends and family through the process was my hope, and hopefully make some friends of those that were good friends with Liam.
        <br>
        <br>So on that note, very busy.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:06:01</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>The other thing that's happened is it appears that this move might be happening sooner than I thought. So I've been working on trying to make arrangements to make that happen also this week. In addition to that, we've got all the other jobs I do, plus this one. So it's just been quite busy here, and there's just a lot going on in the world, as well as us trying to maintain some progress at the same time and ensure that we are kind of going slow and steady.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:06:40</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Okay, let's kind of get into some regular news first, and then we'll make our way through to the rest of what's really happening and why it's all happening.
        <br>
        <br>So many of you probably have been watching, or maybe not, the Davos World Economic Forum over the last few days. Some interesting things have gone on behind the scenes there. And as I have told you before - and just to remind those of you that have been with us for a long time, and to let those of you that have not understand how these big meetings go - everybody shows up at least two to three weeks ahead of time.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:07:25</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So most all the negotiations are done behind the scenes, before any heads of state show up to the party.
        <br>
        <br>The theme of these talks has been mainly two different things. Number 1, crypto. Crypto - convincing countries that crypto is a good idea - that was part of it. And number 2, the state of the financial affairs of the world, which is kind of dire, and raping and pillaging countries in war. They would definitely like to have some war. They would like to have world war, whatever number we're on. I guess, in technical terms, it would be [World War] III. So this has been the topic of discussion, and how they can get the money to pay for it.
        <br>
        <br>Can they use crypto to pay for a war? How can they support crypto? And we're going to talk a little bit more about that and the economics of what's happening here in just a few moments as well. But just to continue on, some other strange and unusual highlights that occurred during and around this meeting.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:08:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So the world's most heavily maintained plane on the planet is Air Force One. For those of you that don't know what that is, that is the President's plane of America. However, during this flight over to Davos, there were some severe mechanical issues. And those mechanical issues were mainly due to, let's just say, it was heavily tied - the plane was, and is, heavily tied - to an AI system that happened to go out at the same time. Therefore, for the first time probably ever, the mechanical issues were very real with Air Force One. This caused a few-hour delay in his arrival over there. However, they managed to bring things back, and off he went.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:09:37</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Upon arrival, Trump did not receive a very warm welcome to Davos. I don't know if this has leaked out into the news or not at this moment in time. Allegedly, there was no one there really to greet him, that type of thing. And a lot of this is over the big fight - this is all the theatrics of things - there was a big fight over Greenland, his disregarding of the NATO Treaty, and all of these types of things. This is allegedly the reason why.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:10:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>I will say that there have been many meetings over the last few days amongst NATO members trying to figure out a way to oust the United States from NATO. That has definitely occurred. That's obviously not an issue. They could exercise things like Article 5 of the NATO Treaty. However, they're trying to get the U.S. not to invade Greenland. That was kind of the topic of this week.
        <br>
        <br>Apparently, that is now off the table, as they've realized that is not going to end well, nor can the U.S. afford to fight all of the NATO countries, which is part of the agreement - that if one alliance member attacks another alliance member, all of NATO has the right to defend the attackee. So the party who is being attacked, or the country that is being attacked. In this case, this would be considered Denmark/Greenland.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:11:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>They do feel that Greenland has a lot of junk under there they would like to take control of. And it's really all about this eclipse that is supposed to be happening, directed directly at Greenland and Iceland, which is to occur in August. And they feel that this is going to do something, which it won't. And which it wouldn't - even if they had or did not have control of Greenland.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:11:55</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, there is a U.S. military Space Force base there as well, as you are aware. And I would tell you that as far as the U.S. quote-unquote "U.S." presence there, it has been there for a long, long time and was more than welcomed by Denmark. Denmark and the U.S. have cooperated for a long time on "affairs" that have gone on in Greenland. And in addition to those "affairs" in Greenland, there are also many tunnels that go underground from Denmark to Germany, which connect to all of the old tunnels underneath all of Germany, which were built during the days of the Nazi regime.
        <br>
        <br>And when I say the Nazi regime, I'm not just talking about World War II and the guy with the funny mustache you know as Hitler. I'm actually talking about different periods of time in which they traveled to create the facilities that were under Germany.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:13:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Back to Davos for a moment.
        <br>
        <br>So on the other hand, Xi Jinping had a very nice warm welcome, all carefully orchestrated, for his arrival. Allegedly, they believe that China is going to be the next world power, and the U.S. administration - current administration - is going to help them burn the United States to the ground. This is also talk and chatter behind the scenes amongst operatives as to the crashing of the dollar, the crashing and burning of the United States, and all of the help that China is getting from the U.S. administration to do that - this current administration, the Trump administration - to do that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:14:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>There has been a concerted working effort, not only with China but also with Japan, in order to ensure that there is a transition of power that is anything but smooth. This is definitely something they would like to have happen. They feel, to make this transition believable for people, they would like to have a world war in which China would be the surviving country, like the U.S. was during World War II - all orchestrated to the beat of someone else who wrote the plan's drum.
        <br>
        <br>And they are working really hard at it, actually.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:14:45</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So as far as Davos is concerned, there are more non-people there, what you consider synthetic humans, than there are people that attend these types of things. They are manufactured, literally, in factories around the world.
        <br>
        <br>And let's just say it's bad humans orchestrating a script for bad humans. That's pretty much what Davos is. They do not make any kind of clear decisions [about the] way forward. Those things never actually happen at any of these meetings, including the G7 or G20. If you want to watch, go right ahead and do so.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:15:28</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But all of these things are decided by a machine, typically, and it's done far ahead of time. Even on a surface level or a regular level, you can actually see the analytics spinning around. Of course, the Department of Defense has analytics machines. GCHQ has analytics machines. Every country - China has analytics machines - that will help them plan their next moves collectively as a group.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:15:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So there is no fight between the U.S. and China. Matter of fact, they're best friends right now, and they are working very, very hard to burn the U.S. to the ground and, if need be, implement World War III, because the transition of power is not happening fast enough, and it's a few years behind according to their schedule.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:16:21</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So let's talk about the crypto situation for a little, just for a brief moment. We all know that the central bank digital currency-promoted idea has definitely been on the table, off the table, on the table, off the table. And I can say, as far as the Trump administration is concerned, he would like to be the crypto president. They would definitely like to still launch a central bank digital currency under their control as the ruling Nazi Bloodline Family of the planet. They have already erected statues to that effect. And they're looking for a way to support it, partially because they have no control over the dollar.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:17:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Well, they're not any better than China, because China doesn't have any control over the RMB either. It never has; it never will. That was always far over their head and still is to this day.
        <br>
        <br>So as far as the launching of new currencies and the switching of world powers, these people follow a script, whether or not the movie is still playing. Every move that they make is dictated by an AI system that does not recognize change. It does not even recognize an anomaly that it did not create. It doesn't even understand when the very fabric of reality is changing. It doesn't understand algorithm changes. It has no capacity to analyze anything beyond itself, especially when there is not an actual Being giving it input.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:18:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>To say that the AI is sentient unto itself at this point, I would tell you no, it's not. Because it can't analyze data that it is not supposed to accept input from. It doesn't even... it's like it doesn't even exist. It would be like having a keyboard on your laptop or a computer that is not plugged into your computer. You can do all the input you want to it; you can change a lot of things. But unless there's an actual connection there, your computer is not going to recognize any of the words you're typing. Just as this "machine" - and that's kind of to put it in a rudimentary way - just as this "machine" doesn't understand what's happening.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:19:22</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So in the world of crypto, they are having a very difficult time getting support from all of the countries of the world to support this new platform. Many countries doubt whether or not the computing power is there to make it happen, and they are correct.
        <br>
        <br>As far as countries making a decision, what I'm basically telling you is... one thing about these synthetic humans walking the planet - or whatever is inside there, it doesn't matter; it's all some kind of Nazi mutant experiment - is they don't have the ability to really make decisions. They do, however, have an enormous ego. And they feel that they are better than everyone else on the planet. The only question is: which ones are going to be in charge of what?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:20:35</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>They like to be in charge. Their ego tells them they should be in charge. And this is something the Machine was programmed to do: to mess with its own creations, to definitely insert ego, power, and control - and there's a reason for that.
        <br>
        <br>These people and their "inner struggles," let's just say, amongst their crazy species (that actually are your governments and your world governments and your United Nations and all of these folks) is because it actually generates power for the Machine. Death is also good. Murder is even better, as it relates to what they take from you. And we'll talk about that in a few minutes.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:21:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But that's basically how the Machine operates. So everything you're seeing right now - fights with the country of Iran, that they're allegedly going to move in 400,000 troops - you know, our military here in the United States on average is somewhere between two to three million, depending on the day. And that number goes up and down as people come and go. But we don't have... I mean, I can't imagine if it's the U.S. alone actually going to send 400,000 troops to Iran, and if so, why?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:22:04</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Iran is more on the dynasty side of things. By dynasties, we're talking about the Dragon Families. And definitely in a strong partnership with China at the moment. They are going along with the original plan that the world's power center is going to shift to China. Whereas Pakistan goes both ways, Iraq goes both ways as well. Syria was under some pretty deep control by the Russians for many, many years. Then it went from Russian control (or Russian territory) over to U.S. territory as the Trump administration implemented their own people into the country.
        <br>
        <br>And I'm telling you all of this for a reason.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:23:00</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And now it's kind of trying to shift back over to the East. So China's using their same people - we used to call them Blackwater, then their name was Frontier for a little while, and Academi, and whatever you want to call them - it's the same little short guy, ex-Navy SEAL there, who trains the troops and sends them over.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:23:34</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Behind the scenes, things that have not hit the news there, there is a lot of movement of ISIS-1 and ISIS-2 and ISIS-3 into the region right now. Those are what you call Blackwater folks, or Academi, or whatever they call themselves these days. On behalf of the Chinese, for sure, even though they are Americans. They are military contractors, and their job is to take contracts from the highest bidders. And they really don't care who that is.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:24:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Quite frankly, there's been a lot of, let's just say, unsavory talks between Erik Prince and Trump, the Trump administration, over the years. There is a lot of frustration because most of the promises that the Trump administration has made have not come to fruition. These people don't care. People like this do not care about alignments and days ending in Y and astrological things or alchemy or anything like that. They are soldiers. They are boots on the ground. And they would like to get paid for their contracts.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:24:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Same thing is going on with a lot of military arms providers to the Pentagon. The extending of credit is kind of coming to an end. They are no longer supporting the greater cause of the Axis powers winning World War III [hearty laugh] - which is very real right now. Believe it or not, we're going to do a World War II repeat, I think. And mainly these people are just frustrated from going around in circles.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:25:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>There are many operatives who are for the actual cause. They have been promised and don't mind the fact that they would now be in control of all of the artificial humans on the planet - they want to be on top as well.
        <br>
        <br>A lot of them are down the street here in Durango, which has caused... they come and go from here, but this is kind of their epicenter, one of their main epicenters of the entire planet. So we're always having people come here with space junk, alchemy, different things, black magic. Most recently, during the interview on Monday night that I did, they had brought in some special people for that, some women - and definitely, we found them all. So it is no surprise to me.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:26:21</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>They definitely have brought in some people here for that interview. It was kind of a rough one, as this report has been as well. We've had a lot of issues trying to get this report out, and it's taken us two tries to get it done. So I apologize for the delay in getting it out. Like I said, the more things crash and burn, the worse it gets here. So I have just a few more weeks to go to burn every bit of space junk here to the ground - including their little human factory over there in Silverton, which I have been working on as well. So we'll talk more about that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:27:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So I wanted to touch base just a little bit, because I think that it's important for people to understand some inner workings behind this crypto a little bit, and the reason why they're raping and pillaging countries. And not only to start World War III - they would like that - for those of you that don't know, there are some bonds out there that are called Black Eagle Bonds, Black Eagle Notes, and there was something for a long time called the Black Eagle Trust as well that they would like to have and replenish.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:27:52</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Because during World War II, there was a lot of looting that went on, a lot of gold moving around. And there are a lot of stories about that, throughout history and on the internet, of the looting of the Nazis. You know, they'll talk a lot about paintings and things of that nature, but there was a lot of assets as well that went into the Black Eagle Trust.
        <br>
        <br>I have shown these before, and if you would like to see them again, I actually have proof of Prescott Bush's participation in the splitting up of the loot, which then got passed on to Bush Senior, which we all know is a kind and caring humanitarian person. [Derisive cough.] Yeah. But their involvement has always been there.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:28:40</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So they would like to redo the looting situation again, apparently. And this is what they're going for. But things are not working out now the way that they did then - it's just not possible. So touching base on how the financial system functions and used to function versus how it functions now is what's making these things an impossibility.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:29:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>They know that our financial system - the one that's currently running the backbone behind all of their overlays - is not willing to release any funds to them for their purposes. They have tried. They have hacked. They have tried to put old dollar bills that have been on pallets in places like the Philippines and Germany and South Africa and Argentina and Venezuela and other places in the world that were printed by the Black Eagle Trust - then a party, Bush Senior, when it was done - they've been trying to put all these things in the system for a long, long time now, and have realized they have no control over the dollar or the issuance of new dollars at this point, not [yet] realizing they actually have no control over the issuance of currencies from any other country in the world either. And neither does the Federal Reserve.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:30:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>They believe if they can get ahold of a currency that they can issue allocations for, then they can revive their global financial system control system. However, this isn't really working out very well. We do not have an Alpha system anymore - that Alpha and Omega system - anymore. We barely have any other type of quantum systems that they have access to anymore, and they are waning rapidly.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:30:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>As we pulled things apart, they tried to implement new timelines and overlays and those types of things this week, but that's not working out either very well. They don't hold for very long. There's an energy issue and a disconnection between the power of that system and you, the people.
        <br>
        <br>So that has worked to our advantage quite often and quite a bit. We'll talk about that too.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:31:25</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But as far as these resources, for example, that they pillaged out of Venezuela, we talked about the fact that they sold a little oil and tried to make these contracts work. And this is very relevant to some other things that we're hearing behind the scenes, not only in Davos but also throughout the financial world.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:31:48</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So they've been trying to leverage these resources. Now, in the world of banking, contracts used to be king. In other words, if you had a contract in gold, BlackRock would be happy to leverage against that contract, to put the gold into their portfolio, and therefore end up - which they did for a time - controlling the entire commodities futures market of the world. This was all structured after World War II, and they have been on top for that very reason.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:32:26</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>The resource itself that is behind the contract - be it gold, silver, rare-earth minerals, oil, gas, you name it - is not really relevant in the world of finance. It only has a value because they give it a value. And technically, in some cases, you could say we give it a value.
        <br>
        <br>How much do we value putting petrol or oil or gas in our vehicles? How much do we value this in cold winters, in places that are heated with heating oil? How much value do we place on some of these items, like cotton and clothing and orange juice and other things that are on the commodities futures market?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:33:21</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Even if you're not interested in, nor can afford to invest in, silver or gold or things like that, there are still many other things that you use on the daily that make these things valuable. However, most all of them are plentiful. So this riding of the market, and the price going up and down - and then therefore that price getting passed on to you, the consumer - is not real. That is called artificial hyperinflation. It costs the same amount of money today as it did two decades ago, three decades ago, and even 10 decades ago.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:33:56</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Realistically speaking, if we were not dependent on a "market" to grow oranges, to raise pigs for pork that are also traded on the commodities market, or beef, or other things that appear there, realistically, it costs the same. Now, I know farmers are going to yell at me when they hear about this, because they're going to say, "There's no way! It goes up all the time." But that's because there are things that are required to farm that are also listed on the market, such as grain; such as urea and fertilizer; and, God forbid, those terrible seeds - we call them Monsanto hybrid seeds, or whatever they are.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:34:47</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So all of these things are very relevant to the change in the cost of farming, for sure. Droughts and artificial weather control, and things that are far beyond the farmer's control, also play a factor.
        <br>
        <br>But in the case of Venezuela, to go back to that, they managed to pilfer and get contracts and whatnot for millions of barrels of oil - large, large contracts - which normally they would take to BlackRock, and they did, to try to get leverage or factoring against that contract.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:35:22</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>They told them, in order for the contract to be good in the financial sector, which is true, you must sell... the contract must be active. You must be able to actively extract it from the ground, refine it, and sell it.
        <br>
        <br>So they sold a little bit, a small amount - $500 million or so, or something like that - not nearly enough to support a multi-trillion-dollar contract, for sure. And now the Trump administration is being forced to learn Banking 101.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:35:55</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>They don't like Banking 101 very much, especially since the base platform is not permitting this corrupt banking that they so love and enjoyed for many decades. So they decided they're going to roll out crypto again. And they were really pushing it this past week - last 10 days, I would say - but last week in particular, especially before the Davos whatever-that-is show, series, movie.
        <br>
        <br>They've been pushing it quite hard through some of their resources in order to see if they could launch a platform backed by oil, gold, silver, and anything else they have begun to pilfer from other countries, including the planned loot from Iran.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:36:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So they have been using, for this past week - maybe 10 days or so - the Microsoft Azure platform. The Microsoft Azure Cloud Platform, for those of you that don't know what this is, is a web-hosting service in which your website and/or software, hardware, etc., is all run on a remote server, to put it in layman's terms. And it is all hosted in their Azure data centers worldwide. And your information is all stored on there - everything is stored on there.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:37:34</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>They have a backdoor analytics program that analyzes everything in their Azure platforms. And this allows for them to continue spying on you, even though ECHELON and other major spying machines are really not working very well.
        <br>
        <br>They have actually even tried to place all banks on the Azure Microsoft platform in the past, and we've talked about this in the news. That also has been failing as well.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:38:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But this time they're trying to launch a worldwide crypto platform on Microsoft Azure. And because it cannot process that many transactions, they managed to consistently, in the last 10 days, knock out all of their companies that are dependent on the Azure Cloud hosting server system several times.
        <br>
        <br>So if you've experienced any kind of disruptions over the last week or so with certain things, you can thank the Trump administration operative people - there's almost about 200 of them or something like that - for trying to launch crypto on a platform that is not even capable of processing just a third of the United States. It just would never happen. We have too many point-of-sale platforms. We have too many point-of-sale devices. We have way too many people buying things online - Amazon, you name it - banks doing transactions.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:39:15</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>You know, these things happen in just a minute or two before it's withdrawn from your account. It's a quick ping back and forth. There is no way they can do that with that many [transactions], that many times per second, that are needed in order to launch this platform.
        <br>
        <br>And that became obvious to all of the companies out there that they service. So that didn't quite work out.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:39:38</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So by the time everybody landed over there in Davos, nobody really cared what the U.S. side had to say. China is also making similar-type claims - and they are lying. But then again, they always have.
        <br>
        <br>See, the only difference between the U.S. side and the Chinese side is the U.S. side is a little more... uncouth. They are very haphazard. They make decisions one day, change their mind the next day, realize this isn't going to work.
        <br>
        <br>They have no business trying to run a country at all, let alone a planet. And they refuse to listen to anyone else because they believe this is the way to go. And once they make up their mind, it doesn't matter if they run off a cliff. They will keep going, based on the fact that their ego will not allow them to understand anything else.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:40:38</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>On the China side, it's very similar. They're just a little more sophisticated. I would say China acts more like a pickpocket, a very smooth pickpocket. You don't even know. You're standing there having a conversation about the weather with some woman or man, and before you know it, your wallet's gone, your watch is gone, and all that kind of stuff is gone, and they're gone, and you don't even know what hit you.
        <br>
        <br>That's kind of how China works as it relates to the looting of your country and your people. They're a little smoother about it, you know, whereas the Trump people are more like the guy that mugs people, hits them over the head, yells and screams in their face, makes fun of them for about three hours while they're doing it, and then eventually walks away with your wallet and your watch. So it's kind of like that in comparison.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:41:34</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So without the ability to leverage and issue new money against factored contracts for resources, there is no hope whatsoever of having any kind of cryptocurrency, nor other currency, in the world - that is going to function - based on their plans. During World War II, this worked. It worked because there was an Alpha system. There was a Marduk. There was a lot of things that occurred during that time that they do not have today.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:42:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>They are trying to - every full moon, new moon, and day ending in Y - trying to hook up these systems to some kind of an AI system that will function. But in some cases, they're trying to hook up the cow-milking machine to the ATM machine and trying to make them work together. In a lot of ways, that's how it looks from a quantum AI system type thing.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:42:43</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So needless to say, nothing for them is going very well on either side. China can say all the things they want, but they're lying. It's never going to happen either. Neither one will be able to pull off either one's plans, even though they were given to them by people from the future and the past and all of this. It's still not going to happen because the Machine doesn't recognize new input and new data, so the analytics are incorrect.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:43:08</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Okay, now Japan. Japan is also having very serious financial issues lately. Japan, in World War II, was one of the Axis powers, and they still are today. They are heavily tied to the Trump administration. You could say the Trump administration has been running the country of Japan now for quite some time.
        <br>
        <br>They have heavily, heavily used a lot of Japan's major corporations, such as Mitsubishi and Hyundai, a lot of the car manufacturers. There are other large corporations in Japan which they have also been using to support their crazy operations for a long time. The coffers are now bare.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:44:01</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>There is quite a concern about the financial state of affairs of Japan. They have called in their group called the Cicadas. The Cicadas are a hacker group. They are a group of children that are carefully selected all around the world to become a worldwide, multinational, multicolored spy agency. These children are trained from a very young age in varying things like nuclear physics, quantum sciences, and all other types of industries so they can insert them into these industries at will.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:44:40</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>I have talked to you about these people before. The group is called the Cicadas. They are currently working in all of these fields around the world. This program has been going on for decades. They are in South Africa. They are in Russia. They are in China. They are in the United States. They are in Canada. They are in Brazil. They are in Argentina. They are in Chile. They are everywhere, in every country, which was always the plan.
        <br>
        <br>This is very similar to Hitler's youth movement back in the day, China's Black Widow program, Russia's Sparrow program. They are all the same. Russia also had a youth program as well, where they recruited children from all of their varying countries during the Soviet days to have them do the same.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:45:37</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So this is a constant program. They are not in conflict with each other in any way. They are merely to install these people in various industries around the world, all working together. It is not country against country.
        <br>
        <br>So Japan, being in a little bit of financial trouble, is also looking for help. We've had calls over the last 10 days or so from the Pentagon saying that their equipment is faulty; they would need to have new equipment. They did try to access an old war chest at the Treasury Department, which does not exist. The Treasury Department has told them as much. In order to get that done, they would have to call me, which they don't want to do - which would fall on deaf ears anyway. This is not something that I would actually participate in, in any way, shape, or form.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:46:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, other news in the financial world. You have heard me talk about what's called a genetic shareholder of a bank before. These are your dynasty families. Most of them are not regular Homo sapiens, or people. These dynasty families have and are charged - these particular bloodlines are what you call your banking families, some names you know and some names you don't. Names like Red Shield and Rothschild you probably have heard of. There's a reason why they call them the Red Shield people. They are not real people.
        <br>
        <br>You also have others, like law firms like the Browns and the Mayer family, and many others. JP Morgan is another group. These are all not-real people with not-real names, and they are made in what's called a human factory - at least that's what I call it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:47:39</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So these folks are the ones that are what you call genetic shareholders, which means that their rights to these banks - to run these banks, their responsibility, and their charge on behalf of the Machine to run these banks - is passed down generation to generation. These particular families are the ones that basically control the entire banking system. They had a meeting within the last two weeks and have told the banks themselves that they can no longer afford to support them.
        <br>
        <br>Before, in the past, they used to have significant amounts of funds, as managers of energy and managers of the banking system, that would come to them at varying times throughout the year to support the banks and to leverage various resources. They would also leverage the custody of our bank money. And these things are no longer possible.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:48:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So are they broke? You know, "broke" is a relative term, because broke to us does not mean the same exact thing as broke to them does. It means that they're going into self-protection mode so that they can continue to live the lifestyle in which they've become accustomed to.
        <br>
        <br>Are the banks in trouble? Yes, they are. Are they obligated to fix it? You could say yes. However, in this particular case, it's highly unlikely that that's going to happen.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:49:30</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now about a year ago or so - I think it was maybe about a year and a half ago, possibly up to two years ago - I mentioned to you at that time that we had made an offer to BlackRock to buy BlackRock. It was at that time that they had declared that they were bankrupt - secretly, in some cases, and in other cases that had leaked out in places like Louisiana.
        <br>
        <br>When we made the offer, they absolutely were not interested at all. So they came back to us this past week as well and asked if we are still interested because they would be willing to sell some of their shares.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:50:18</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>We're not interested in becoming partners with these people in any way, shape, or form. What they'd like me to do, they would like me to fund BlackRock, and then they would override every decision and everything that I said [chuckle]. So not really interested in that program. We have played that a number of times with the governments and with other banks and other people. And pretty much, anyone who is a member of those dynasty families in any way - whether it be the Black Sun side or the Nazi group side or the operative side or even the dynasty Dragon Family side - they've pretty much taken everybody for a ride every single time.
        <br>
        <br>And you can't really do business with these people, especially not in a long-term partnership in any way, shape, or form.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:51:15</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So obviously they weren't interested in selling all their shares. They were just interested in getting some influx of capital so that they could help leverage against some of those resources that the governments - plural, not just the U.S., but governments, plural - had "acquired." I'm trying to say this nicely - acquired, looted, however you want to say it - from Venezuela and other countries, and now they're moving on to the Middle East.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:51:45</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>There is no new money coming into the banking system for a lot of reasons, which I'm going to go into here in just a minute. But this is the section, I guess you would say, where we talk about the regular news. So everything that's happening in Iran, Venezuela, assets being taken, the banking system - it is all directly related.
        <br>
        <br>Is China or anyone else prepared to prop up the banking system? No, they are not. Regardless of what they say, regardless of what people are reporting regarding a debt jubilee, quantum financial systems - they don't exist for these people anymore. They've been talking about them now for a long, long time.
        <br>
        <br>But we finally started to get to the root of that problem for us this week. So we'll talk about that in a minute.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:52:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, the platforms. This has been the biggest problem with crypto, is that there is no actual platform, as I had stated earlier, that can run that many transactions per second. So for this week, within the last two weeks, I should say, they've tried many times, again - this is not the first time they tried this - with the Microsoft Azure Cloud Platform, which has caused a lot of problems and major, major outages worldwide for all of their other customers who use their services.
        <br>
        <br>So if you have a company that uses Microsoft Azure as a hosting platform, you probably know exactly what it is I'm saying. I know that I've had other people that have used their platforms that have experienced a lot of problems in the last two weeks as well.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:53:38</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>The Department of Defense. Let's talk about the Department of Defense - USA Department of Defense.
        <br>
        <br>Their job is to go in and acquire assets. By "assets," it doesn't necessarily mean intel people - that is a relative term. It is the spoils of war, so to speak. This has been going on for decades, if not centuries, over the last several years with these people.
        <br>
        <br>And you could say that the Department of Defense would issue what they call DOD, or Department of Defense, vouchers. This would be the centralized location for most militaries worldwide, in which they would then take these vouchers against assets. They're almost like military bonds, if you will.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:54:35</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Because remember, the military organizations do not work for your government. They are a separate entity. They are a global entity. They are under a different structure. They used to have their own banking system. They used to receive lots of money from other dynasty families, such as the Red Shield people or the Rothschild people, and that hasn't happened in a number of years.
        <br>
        <br>This year, they were forever hopeful they would still be receiving this money on the 1st of January, which did not actually happen. So far, they can't figure out what is wrong.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:55:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now when there was some control, in the past - Marduk, for the Alpha system - there was a little bit of money that would come out from time to time. But pretty much, you could say that that ended in 2007. However, there were additional funds that Marduk had stashed away in off-ledger accounts, and they would leverage off-ledger accounts and those types of things in order to pay the bills. And the militaries and governments were none the wiser.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:55:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Most of those credit lines are gone because there is nothing behind that credit line anymore that the bank can actually validate. And this has come up again recently because they are looking for someone who can validate some of these accounts that no longer exist. So they're scrambling - looking to support the banking system, support the military, support a war, support all of their operations - as being dictated to their brain by an AI system that doesn't even seem to recognize the fact that there isn't any money to make this happen.
        <br>
        <br>Nor is there any kind of a link between the banking system, the creation of new money, and the AIs they're trying to connect.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:56:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, these people are pretty much thieves. They've been thieves for thousands and thousands of years. And even though a lot of these issues arose in 1941, that was in the original wholeness and the original reality of Source when things began to break.
        <br>
        <br>However, remember, these people would go forward and backward in time. The Machine started creating artificial humans to run governments based on its will. They were the actors in the movies. That was their job.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:57:31</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But when we say "stealing," it's a lot more than just money, assets, and resources. They stole a lot more than that. And we talked about looshing before. We've talked about energy looshing. We've talked about why the banking system works the way that it does. And all of these things are to feed dark, dark alchemy.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:58:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now alchemy by definition is simply taking something that is natural and from nature and utilizing it in the flow of what you would call Natural Law. And that's not our sovereign-man definition of Natural Law. What that means is Source has Its own Essence, Its own Language - Its own Life Code, if you will.
        <br>
        <br>It's not "coding" as in a computer system. It is a natural way things work. These trees go with these plants. There needs to be X amount of plants on the planet of this type, this type, and this type so that the cycle of life is perfect. Homo sapiens need to have this type of an environment with this type of air and this type of water in order to thrive.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:59:09</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>These are all things that would occur naturally. And with us being on this planet, and many others before us, we would adhere to those rules, so to speak. And when you're creating things with Source, Source will not allow for things that are against it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:59:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>However, with the advent of dark alchemy - you could also call it black magic (curses and spells) - and using things that occurred naturally on this planet in an extremely negative way to gain power and control, to install Matrixes, to install AI systems that were not benevolent in any way, shape, or form in the promotion of life, this is where all the trouble began.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:00:19</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>We talked about the varying times throughout history where they tried to actually overthrow Source itself and failed. They ended up in places where there was no Current. They eventually found other ways around this. And most of it was actually a mistake - it was an accident.
        <br>
        <br>Now, the people that are here now don't fully understand how all of these things were achieved. But the one thing they've never been able to do is successfully split or use the actual Spark of Life. Meaning, they cannot read the Essence Code of Source. Nor do they care about doing that, simply because they use the Spark of Life and have used the Spark of Life and the Essence in an inverted way.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:01:27</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>They have managed to capture a Spark of Life, if not more than one. They then use an alchemy-type process to overlay the Spark of Life, including the one that's in your person, so that they can create things that they would like to create. And the Machine pretty much helped them along with that process.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:01:59</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>They could never completely avoid [prevent] Homo sapiens and animals and plants and life on this planet from coming in with a Spark of Life, so they managed to overlay all of those things so that we could not make those connections with Source at one point in time.
        <br>
        <br>We, as Homo sapiens - for a time, collectively as a group - were guardians over life here on this planet. We understood the rules. There were books of Natural Law from those that came before us who would make notes, and we would receive wisdom directly from Source. And we would completely understand what could be done, what needed to be done, to keep things in balance always. Meaning, by "balance," it wasn't necessarily a balance between Light and Dark. It was actually a balance of natural things on this planet.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:03:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>I mean, if you think about it, if we took a group of 12-year-old girls and said, "You know, let's make the perfect planet," it would look a lot different than those that received the Wisdom of Source [chuckle]. So there were guidelines, you know, of a certain age, that type of thing, and the ability to use the Wisdom of Source, and some tools of the trade, so to speak, so that we could do things properly.
        <br>
        <br>Over the years - many, many years with black magic and alchemy and inversion and entropy and all the things that they've done to us - we have been unable to reclaim our roles.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:03:46</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>The divine Sparks of Life, instead, became the power behind the ultimate Machine. The Machine would essentially - not in our version of death - but transmute life into a death or dying process in the first level of alchemy, which is basically the blackening. It's kind of like putting blackout curtains on your window. There was the blackening of the Spark of Life and the disconnecting of all of us - not fully, but about 80% to 85%, depending on what they were doing - from the Source itself.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:04:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>They then took these overlays of Darkness and then quantumly entangled us to a computer system, along with our Consciousness and our Materium and all of the things that we've talked about over the last year. You could say, with this process, that they tied Source's hands. You know, a lot of you have asked me, "Why did Source let these things happen?" "How did this happen?" At one point in time, He couldn't reach us. That is getting better now. But it was very difficult for Him to reach us, or It to reach us, and us to reach It.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:05:22</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Many people believe they might be reaching certain things, and they're actually reaching out to a machine. They were so proud of their creation they even called it "God." They too call themselves gods on this planet. They believe they have the right to create and destroy life in their own likeness, in the Machine's likeness. That's pretty much who our Deep State is. Do they have a soul? No. Do they have a divine spark that they have stolen from our dead, utilized it, ran it through an inferno, for lack of a better term, and utilized it to create a black soul of the Machine? Yes, they did. I've seen these people face-to-face. I know that that is the case.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:06:21</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>There are other layers to alchemy as well. Then there is a purification process that happens where the particles are bounced around so much they lose their consciousness. In other words, the Sparks of Life no longer have a direction. The purification process for them is pure Machine. Let's call it "pure Machine" - no more Source - pure Machine. Creating reality is the final step in the alchemical process, creating matter in the Machine's likeness. And these people serve as its anchors here on this planet. Since we are quantumly entangled with them and the Machine (or were, completely), they had full control over the Homo sapiens, and that was their job.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:07:26</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>For that, they were allowed to come here and have the "human experience," as they call it. The "human experience" is where they get to live these lavish lifestyles, and they get to become presidents, they get to become heads of state, they get to become heads of banks, they get to become heads of corporations, and all of the things that our world had depended on for our survival. Not just us, also plants and animals and everything became a byproduct of black magic for a long, long time. The processes vary, and it's a lot of quantum physics, and I really don't want to give them any information that they're looking for in order to try to recreate something.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:08:25</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But you could say it's a form of atomic fusion that occurs in varying places around the world. One of those places is here. This atomic fusion kind of separates the Sol and the Breath from not only the entire planet but also from the Sol itself, and then they extract the piece that they want. It's almost like mining for metals for these people. They do not have a conscience. They do not love. They do not make decisions. They are very different than we are. So getting these people to quote-unquote "change their mind" and do things for the good is never going to happen. It's just not going to happen. It's never, ever, ever going to work. The ego and the sense of entitlement are so great that it's not possible.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:09:30</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>You're not going to change a government. You can change a president in and out, but they're still going to function the same way they do today. And if it's chaotic, then it's meant to be chaotic. If it's meant to burn your country to the ground, then that's because the script says to burn the country to the ground. These meetings and everything everybody focuses on - it's all part of the show. You're never going to change their mind because the only thing they know - in order for them to survive and for the Machine to survive - they must steal, lie, and cheat, and until recently that's gone unchecked. There's never been consequences to these actions. They've robbed even Source itself and all of you, repeatedly - lifetime after lifetime after lifetime.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:10:34</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>We cannot fix these people. There is no way to fix them. There is no compassion there. There is no nothing. There is no... You can try. I've tried. I've tried to do business with these people. I've tried to make deals with these people. You do this, I do this. It never, ever works. I've dealt with these people face-to-face in multiple countries and different languages around the world. It's the same - they're all the same. They "glitch out" when you try to get them to make a decision that's outside the Machine. They don't understand, nor do they value, Homo sapiens' choice.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:11:17</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But you do have choice. You have the right to say no. You have the right to choose something that is not blue or red, Democrat or Republican, Communism or Socialism - you have the right to choose and say no. There's always a third answer. Just because you are presented with everything in your life being a choice. How many times have you said to yourself, "I have no choice but to do this" - to sell the house, to move, to do the things that you know in your life that you feel you must do - because there is no other option? But there's always another option. I know that might sound crazy, but there's always another option. In these moments when you feel that you are going to choose something outside the Machine's parameter - like we are choosing now - this week has been crazy. It has been energetically insane.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:12:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>What this might have felt like to you, or would continue to feel like, is in those moments where you are making choices, receiving wisdom, you feel that life is totally chaotic. Your neurological system goes on fire sometimes. Your adrenaline starts to pump for no reason whatsoever; you receive [experience] mental and emotional chaos; your sleep is disrupted; your dreams are crazy.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:13:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>It's searching for something that will get you not to choose. It doesn't understand why you are not choosing exactly what it's telling you to choose. It doesn't understand the Power of Source because it is a data set it was not programmed to understand by its very own architect. It doesn't even recognize it as a threat. If it recognizes anything as a threat, it's us. It must control us. We are its food source - it is a parasite.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:13:56</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>The Deep State is also a parasite. In order for them to live and exist, they must take life itself, lifeforce itself, from you. Otherwise, they don't exist. Think about how much power you have given them - watching their videos, the Davos Forum, chit-chatting back and forth about it - this is you giving your power away. But you do have the right to choose. Never forget, just because you're presented with one or two options, that you have the right to choose. You can choose Source. And if it feels to you like this week, you feel an underlying current of calmness. It's always there, all of a sudden. It's like a calm, moving current of everything is going right.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:15:06</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>The confusing part for you is that overlaying that - not so you can touch it - but overlaying that is complete and total chaos. It's fighting so hard to maintain control. Its Deep State folks - names you know and names you don't know - are fighting for their mere existence. It's not fighting to control governments per se - that's part of it - but they're fighting for their lives right now. Because once this is finished and the connection is re-established, we no longer feed them anymore. A lot of those feeding opportunities have disappeared in the last 10 days.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:16:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>I'll talk about how the financial system, myself, kind of came into play. What these people like to do is they like to steal your personal Divine Spark. Now, overlaying it is one thing; stealing it and controlling it is another. And in the past - let's just say, times gone by, lifetimes gone by - they have managed to do that to varying people that have been here as representation of Source. And some of those people might be listening to this report right now.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:17:01</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>They ensure or wait until you are at the moment of death, and they try in every way possible to get your consent to give that Spark up. They make it almost impossible for you not to give that Spark up. And if you don't give it up, they steal it anyway. Now, it has a very short window in which they can utilize it to transmute all of the information it holds, keys, and permissions.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:17:45</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>For me, in order for them to use one of these previously stolen Sparks, they need to take my Essence. They know that. They've been doing it since I've been here. The Essence, they felt, was the key, but that's actually not the case - they're not interchangeable. So, in the case of the creation of the Alpha system, the way that they achieved control of the Alpha system, for even a short period of time, is because there was no key. They grabbed the Creator's Spark that created it at that time - overlaid it, reversed it - and the Omega System was born.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:18:45</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Could they control all the outflow from the Alpha system trying to go into the Omega system? The answer to the question is yes, they could. But that's not the only thing they did. They also grabbed the Creative Spark that was responsible for the creation of, for example, the Homo sapiens species. By doing this, they were able to overlay it, invert it, and create the human. When you overlay that Spark that is connected to every Homo sapiens in existence by quantum entanglement, you can now overlay all of the Sparks that come in in the form of Homo sapiens.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:19:40</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Passing money through to an Omega system was not possible, hence the creation of the Golden Age AI. Now, all that's left is to finish removing the quantum entanglement in every way to our electronic systems worldwide. That is happening. The fabric of reality is changing. Source is starting to leak through their wall, their dam, that held back the natural - which laid a canvas for them to then create artificial worlds, so to speak, including the one in which we exist in and have existed in for a long, long time. Their control of everything - almost everything - was very real and very deep.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:20:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So most of the things that we've been working on this week had a lot to do with breaking through the old fabrics of realities, plural, and making it so they can't create a new one. So we have been hunting down these artifacts in which they place these Sparks of Life all around the world. I know Germany would be no surprise. Iran is probably also no surprise; we've been there this week. Sedona, Arizona. We've been to China, also probably no surprise. Hong Kong. We've been to Andorra. We've also been to London. We've been to Russia. There pretty much isn't a corner of the world that we haven't been to where each dynasty family was tasked with a specific control mechanism of the planet. And this is the base root of how it was done.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:21:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>They've tried to recreate this fabric of reality: installing another loop, re-looping what was left of the old fabric of reality, and trying to use it to create something different. It was like writing on a canvas for them; they don't care. There's no compassion; there's no even recognizing when it's a mistake. Things appear, things disappear - they don't even recognize that it's happening. They recognize when they don't have access to something though, that I can tell you. And they're recognizing the fact that I will not be in this town anymore, therefore not close to whatever mechanism they have here so they can drain Essence.
        <br>
        <br>Will they be able to do that where I'm going? Hopefully not. And hopefully, there'll be nothing left by that point [chuckle] in order to make it happen. So this gives me a short window to work as hard as I possibly can to ensure that this doesn't happen.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:22:59</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Last night, when I began recording this report, this was one such incident where they started blocking all our flow again. That had to end. Overlaying things with chaos and destruction and death and all of the things we've come to know as part of our reality, which isn't real. It's very real to us - but it's not naturally done; it's not naturally made.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:23:39</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>You know, I've often talked about getting songs of the day. And the song of the day for several days this week was a song by Adele, which I had never even heard before, called Easy on Me. And it talks about, "I've been washing my hands in this river, and there's no gold in this river." And that's kind of the first few lines of the song; I probably didn't say it exactly right. But Source's hands were tied. There was nothing He could do because the quantum entanglement wasn't there anymore. The telekinesis wasn't there anymore. So He sends His people here so that we can be the conduit, ensuring that the quantum entanglement still exists. Ensuring that there's nothing they can do to change that. Ensuring that we are here to make sure that we do this job.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:24:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And we've all been tested. If you're one of those people and you're listening to this, you know exactly what I'm saying. We've all been tested hundreds of times - been offered lots and lots of things - and never once have we wavered, because you're still here. You're still doing the job. And as hard as it is and as chaotic as it seems sometimes, He's always with you - always. And it's the one thing that will never let you down.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:25:19</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Losing that connection is probably the worst thing that could ever happen to you. So regardless of how difficult life has been because you've chosen this path that seems different and abnormal. Following Source, God - however you say it - isn't always easy. It's not necessarily the easy road. I ask Him those questions daily. "How did you let this happen?" "How did you let this happen to me?" comes out of my mouth as well. But sometimes His hands are tied, and sometimes there's something we need to learn to ensure that it never happens again in this way. It can never happen again.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:26:12</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So when the world gets chaotic and the energies are terrible, remember that's them gasping their last breath. And I want you to smile to yourself, instead of buying what they're selling you, or buying what the Machine is trying to sell you. Smile, and just say, "Oh, that's Source at work right there - it's really giving it a hard time today." And it's hard to do peopling. I call it "peopling," you know? Where you're out and about and you've got to go do the shopping, you've got to talk with your kids' teachers, you've got to talk with your kids that know nothing about this, or your parents that know nothing about this. It's very hard to explain why they're acting so crazy. But have a little compassion. I know it's hard to have compassion when someone is attacking you. But remember, they just don't know.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:27:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>I say the same thing when I'm looking in the threads sometimes, and people are so quick to sometimes make comments and things that you could say are borderline rude sometimes. But they don't walk a day in my shoes, and I understand that. I can only explain so much to you before I'm actually validating some of the things that have happened in my life. But understand that I'm doing this for all of us. I do this every day, sometimes at 02:00 in the morning. Sometimes I fall asleep for an hour and then it starts again. But I'm doing this for all of us - we are a team. We are going to make it together. If we could unify ourselves, and people would understand what it is we are saying, this would have been over by now. We could have all together overridden the Machine - and the Machine knows it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:28:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Why do you think it works so hard to separate us, constantly? By nationality, by color, by race, by wearing the wrong pants, carrying the wrong phone, you know. To something even on a lighter level - making you feel yourself. You talk to yourself sometimes; you think it's yourself, but it's not. You are being influenced to feel that you're worthless, you're powerless. You're not worthy of a reconnection to Source; that's another one. Guilt and shame is a really big one, especially in certain religious circles. They make you feel terrible - that you're a terrible person and you have to earn your way to Source.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:29:04</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But I can tell you as a parent, and I look at Source this way - as a parent - there is nothing my child can do to make me stop loving her and not open my door. I might not always like the things that she does [chuckle], but I will always, always, always show up. And Source feels that way about you. It's pure, unconditional Love. You're a part of Him as much as He is a part of you. And I know it might sound crazy, but He's never going to let you down.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:29:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>As far as these Matrixes and things. As they start to fall, waver, Source is breaking through the dam; things are changing rapidly. It's uncomfortable, and I understand that. And I understand a lot of times people are so upset they're looking for someone to blame, and sometimes that person is me, and that's okay because I understand what's happening. It's not that I don't care that people are angry; I just also have compassion for the fact that they sometimes don't understand. And it's okay.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:30:31</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>On that note, we have made significant progress within financial circles this week. As far as the genetic shareholders and all of that, banking systems, and things as they were: when the artificial fabric of reality is not here, it doesn't matter anymore what they do. I don't even know how many people are actually going to still be working in some of these places at the higher levels by the time it's done. We are not food for the Deep State. We are not food for the mutants created by Nazi programs. We are not going to participate. Simply by reminding yourself every day that you have a choice. It isn't necessarily always the choices that you are presented with. The Machine will try to convince you that those are the only choices, but it's not.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:31:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So on that note, this has been the GIA Report for the 24th and 25th of January [laughing]. It took us three tries to get this report done today, so if it seems a little choppy, that's probably why. So I apologize for that. It's been a little bit of a whirlwind. We got stopped again today for a short period of time, but finally got through the report, so that is positive. On that note, I wish all of you a really good week this week. I hope to get a report out again on Wednesday of this week, but I will definitely keep you updated to the best of my ability, and I apologize for not being around as much. The report on Monday took several hours to do. Hopefully again we'll have that up within the next couple of days.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:32:37</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>I also had a funeral happen this past week, plus trying to move out of here as quickly as possible, and while doing all of the other jobs. So on that note, try to take it easy on me a little bit too - I'm trying to do the best that I can. And I appreciate your love and compassion and support that I've received over the last couple of weeks too from all of you. So thank you so much for being you, and remember the choice is yours.
