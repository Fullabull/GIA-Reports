        <br>
        <strong>
        <br>It's the 28th of February, 2025. Coming up on today's Global Intelligence Agency Operations Report: It appears there is some confusion as to which departments actually belong to the government and which ones reported to the Crown Corporation. There are more departments of government around the world that reported directly to Crown Corp, or the Order of the Black Sun, than you may think. And the reckoning for the Trump operatives and the Rothschild family is coming fast as they continue to try and exert their power, and everyone else is, well, not listening. And the Trump operatives have big plans to claim they are responsible for all the changes WE are making, but will their plans work?
        </strong>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:00:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And it's the 28th of February. I can't believe this month is already over. Oh, what a long month for me [chuckle]. Oh, and the craziness just keeps on coming. And I know that this is just too good not to talk about. So on that note, we've got a little video for you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:01:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>'Trump': Because you're in no position to dictate that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:01:17</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Zelenskyy: I am not dictating.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:01:19</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>'Trump': Remember this. You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel. We're going to feel very good. We're going to feel very good and very strong. You're right now not in a very good position. You've allowed yourself to be in a very bad position and he happens to be right about it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:01:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Zelenskyy: From the very beginning of the war.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:01:37</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>'Trump': You're not in a good position. You dont have the cards right now. With us you start having cards. But right now, you don't have your playing cards.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:01:43</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Zelenskyy: I am not playing cards. I am very serious Mr. President. I am very serious.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:01:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>'Trump': You're playing cards. You're playing cards. You're gambling with the lives of millions of people. You're gambling with World War III. You're gambling with World War III.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:01:52</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Zelenskyy: What do you think about?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:01:55</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:02:00</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Zelensky: I am really respectful to you. I am very respectful.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:02:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>'Trump': It's back to you. Far more than a lot of people said they should have.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:02:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Vance: Have you said thank you once in this entire meeting?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:02:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Zelenskyy: A lot of times. Even today.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:02:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Vance: No. In this entire meeting - have you said thank you? You went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition in October. Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who's trying to save your country.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:02:17</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Zelenskyy: What's he speaking about? Please, you think that if you will speak very loudly about the war you can...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:02:27</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>'Trump': He's not speaking loudly. He's not speaking loudly. Your country is in big trouble. Zelenskyy: Can I answer?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:02:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>'Trump': No, no, you've done a lot of talking. Your country is in big trouble. Wait a minute, no, no, you've done a lot of talking. Your country is in big trouble.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:02:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Zelensky: I know. I know.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:02:37</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>You're not winning. You're not winning this. You have a damn good chance of coming out okay because of us.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:02:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Zelensky: We are staying, Mr. President.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:02:45</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Well, that was a whole lot of nothing, wasn't it? It's like WWF, but for out-of-shape people [laughing].
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:02:57</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>I have to bring it up just because it's all over social media and everybody's talking about 'The Smackdown.' And it's kind of reminiscent of Putin riding bareback in Siberia, shirtless, you know, the whole thing. And really - it's so clear that it's so staged and such bad acting. I mean, when in history have you ever seen a president of any country really do a live smackdown on TV, being tough on Ukraine? [chuckle]
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:03:35</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>It reminds me of what parents say to their kids. "You're bad!" "Why am I bad?" "Well, just because I said so." It's just so bad. Oh, my God. And behind the scenes, it's even worse.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:03:49</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But also, to make things worse, there's a little tweet that went out by a Republican, I think it's a Republican, Joe Wilson from North Carolina. Apparently, we have gone from MAGA, Make America Great Again, to now MIGA, Make Iraq Great Again. It just gets worse and worse, really. What, are we going to have MUGA and Make UK Great Again? Maybe we'll throw in a couple of other countries, probably only ones that start with a vowel because it doesn't make any sense for the rest of them. You know, we can have MIGA make Iran great again or Israel great again. We'll just go around the world until we run out of countries that begin with a vowel, I guess.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:04:45</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>This same representative would also like to put Trump's face on a $250 bill. Yeah, you know, this actually reminds me of back in the Kennedy days and the $3 bills that were put out by the Treasury Department. You know, I... Oh, Duck Dynasty. It just gets worse and worse.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:05:12</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, we got some calls this week to Tom, actually, and - because nobody will talk to me directly; I think they're all afraid of me - they got calls from Langley and a few other intelligence agencies this week, including Defense National Intelligence and a few other places. And this was all about complaining about what the Trump administration is trying to do - or the operatives, I should say. They are talking - Langley was talking - about the appointment of Radcliffe and that Radcliffe would like to get all the information on all the operatives around the world that are out there on behalf of the CIA. He would also like to call out or fire - I don't know what he's calling 'rogue operatives,' and I don't really think this guy knows what he's doing. Not 'I don't think' - I definitely know this guy doesn't know what he's doing.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:06:19</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now we all know that the Trump operatives are working directly for Rothschild. And at one point in time, there were divisions of the CIA that were reporting directly to Rothschild also. And Langley has been at a divide for quite a long time, meaning you have those with the Order of the Black Sun representing Black Sun heads of state, past and present. And then you have those that are representing the Democratic side or Democratic presidents or those that are blue or with the Blue Dragon known as Rothschild.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:07:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So this has been going on for a long time. So it's kind of hard to define 'rogue' in this case. And not only that, you know, you've got agents that are deep, deep inside of different places. And I'm not saying I agree or disagree with everything that Langley has been told to do and is doing, because some of the people, such as Langley 5, are absolutely nuts and off their rocker, and are still trying to run operations like it's 1985, or, well, 84.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:07:40</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>They have been running around the planet, trying to get pallets of cash that Bush had put out there years ago, trying to cash them in, when they all know full well and good that that cash is never going to be put in a bank. Those are what you call 'super notes' or duplicated [counterfeit] United States dollars. They have been out there for a long, long, long time, since the days of Bush Sr. at the CIA and behind the scenes even higher as the head of the Order of the Black Sun, or Black Dragon, or whatever you want to call it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:08:17</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, they've been running a bunch of operatives and agency people around for years - and it's not just U.S. dollars on pallets either that were never meant to be put into the system. Matter of fact, if you talk to some of the older operatives that are still around, they also know that they were picking up these pallets of cash, shredding them, and they were going into some kind of an account somewhere.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:08:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So at one point in time - off-ledger money is one thing, on-ledger money is a whole other story - and this money was never meant to be put on ledger. It was meant to be show money - always has been. It was something created by Bush Sr. in order to get people to work for nothing. But yet, for some reason, the operatives that worked for Bush Sr. - you know, they're probably in their 60s now, late 50s - what never ceases to amaze me is, they don't get it. How do you not get it?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:09:21</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Why are you still running what you call 'Project Becky' and thinking that these are gonna be cashable? They've never been cashable before. You might have put a few thousand dollars or something, you know, maybe a decade ago into the system or something like that, but you know, that ship kind of sailed a while ago. I mean, it's been, phew, at least six or seven years since they've been able to do that, so I'm not really sure why they're still running around, but I don't know. Maybe they're just listening to a bunch of crazy old men acting like it's 1985.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:10:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But other things are coming to the forefront. So we were asked our opinion on a number of different things that are going on with the Trump administration - because they are questioning their sanity - and so am I. I mean, I call them 'Duck Dynasty' for a reason. So the question here is - and this was the biggest concern - apparently people are now starting to see that there's a very real possibility that the United States government may go bankrupt. And our version of bankrupt and their version of bankrupt are kind of two different things. But they're definitely seeing a possibility of what we have been saying all along is true: that they'd like to bankrupt the country and buy it back for pennies on the dollar.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:10:54</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>We know about the DOGE raids. I call them the 'DOGE raids' because they are, well, basically trying to steal a bunch of money to help Rothschild achieve this task. So they have been looking to try to get money out of Social Security; they've been looking to try to get money out of different government departments; they've been trying to siphon that money through places like Israel and Switzerland and other places. And they can't quite figure out what is wrong.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:11:25</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>You know, couple that with the fake gold debacle that they've run into recently, and they're realizing that there isn't any gold to back anything. Yeah, the dollar in the U.S. is in big trouble right now. But, during this call with Langley, and then the subsequent call to me, I explained a number of different things that maybe they know, maybe they don't know. I'm not sure.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:12:01</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>First of all, the CIA is not a government department. It never has been a government department - not since its inception has it been a government department. There are many departments that we think are going to be cleaned up as the swamp is drained by Orange People, and they're going to save the day. We have heard things like the military is going to be cleaned up, the CIA is going to be cleaned up. Homeland Security is going to be cleaned up. The Treasury Department is, you know, that DOGE's on that like white on rice. Nobody's really mentioned the Mint. The Federal Reserve is dead because of Trump and Orange People. You know, it kind of reminds me of Willy Wonka, Oompa Loompa.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:12:52</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And then none of this is actually going to happen by an alleged member or group of operatives running the U.S. government. It's just simply not possible. So you see, in the world of rankings as to who is who in the zoo - technically, places like the military, the CIA, DNI, Homeland Security, the FBI - none of these are registered government departments. That's the first thing. Secondly, they've reported to higher ranks than the office of the president.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:13:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Just because these operatives are in a big white house, they think they have the right to send in their own people to go ahead and clean up the quote-unquote 'swamp.' But they keep forgetting that these are just contractors. They not only work for the United States, they also work for the Order of the Black Sun. They also report to, say, other folks like Global Headquarters, in the past or currently. They reported then eventually to Black Nobility in Italy. They also reported to a bunch of nonhumans at one point in time. And all the way up at the top, at the end of the day, they reported to the same people everybody else does.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:14:21</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>As far as the office of the president, normally the office of the president - of any country, that is - would never be able to phone such a high office, meaning they wouldn't have the same communication that the CIA has had and the military has had. Also, the other thing they forget is the Treasury is also not a government department. There is no Mint that is a government department. Definitely not the Fed - we all know that. The IRS - also not a government department. Pretty much anything that runs finances in the United States is not a government department - they all reported to Rothschild. And I say 'Rothschild,' and I use the name loosely - because it's pretty much the Order of the Blue Dragon that has been, well, in control of the United States sector anyway.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:15:15</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>You know, we have different colors of dragons, as you know, that other countries reported to. But such a low office as the Office of the President doesn't have the right to walk into any of these institutions, and I explained this loudly to several people because it's way above their head - it's outside their authority. Now, I think because a lot of these guys that work there as operatives are SSP or Secret Space Program operatives, they feel they have a higher clearance level than some of these other groups.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:15:54</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, that can be rectified in two seconds flat. You know, I don't have any problem with that, as long as everybody has an understanding that you now work for me. Nobody hires thousands of people and then says, "Oh, here's a bunch of money; have a nice day - you don't have to actually work or anything." Said no one, ever. So, on that note, the call was heard loud and clear.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:16:25</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But there's a lot going on with the Trump operatives, too. First of all, them throwing this guy in there with marching orders, trying to say they're going to clean up 'rogue operatives' that aren't really rogue, and they're going to clean up all these other operations [chuckle] - this is just another money grab.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:16:49</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Look, I don't agree with all the businesses that the CIA is into, let's just say. And I don't agree with a lot of the methodologies that they use, let's just say. But the DOGE department and the Trump administration and their operatives are so easy to read. Do they care about making America great again or making Iraq great again, MIGA, MEGA, MOGA, MUGA? No, they don't.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:17:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Technically, if you really want to look at it this way, without all of us - meaning American citizens or citizens of any other country - you don't have a country. But in this particular case, all they're really trying to do is take operations money that is earned from, let's just say, strange and unusual trading practices, and I'll leave it at that, because we are talking on the news here. Strange and unusual trading practices that have gone on, and put it underneath their umbrella, because they're starting to lose all of those siphons, and there really isn't a whole lot to be found by the DOGE department anymore. And that's becoming more and more apparent.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:18:12</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So they're looking for anyone, anywhere, especially in the United States, that makes any kind of money so that they can actually take it. And that's really what this is all about - it's not about cleaning up and draining any swamps or anything - this is a money grab, 150%. And I told them so.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:18:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Not only that, you expect to walk into a decades-old organization that has many different divisions. In the past, you see, there was a quote-unquote 'farm.' And what I mean by 'farm' is there are different operatives and agency folks that are hired during a change in administration. And they are there - they say - to serve the administration. So apparently the Trump operatives would like their division of Langley as well - because Radcliffe has gone in there with marching orders saying he'd like to form a new division of the CIA for the Trump administration, or another 'farm,' as they are called.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:19:30</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, there's a few problems with that. Number 1, by 'administration' - in the definition, at least in Langley's terms and in military terms - means this is a new movie. So if you think of the world of politics in every single country, you can think of it like Universal Studios or MGM Studios. And MGM and Universal Studios, as an example here, they put out movies, you know, several movies a year. You watch them in the movie theaters. You watch them, you stream them - Netflix puts out tons of movies, whichever movie organization you'd like to take a look at, put them at the top.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:20:26</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, above the movie organization, you had the scriptwriters. And the scriptwriters are Marduk, Enki, Enlil, you know, and then the orders were passed down to the Parents, or you could call them the 'editing division,' and they would then call all the actors guilds around the world and hire new actors to play in a movie.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:20:52</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, every administration, in accordance with militaries and agencies around the world... because even the old KGB wasn't part of the USSR, neither is the SVR. As an example, MI6 is not a part of the United Kingdom government, neither is MI5. You know, this goes for every single country in the world, insert name here. All of your agencies are not working for your governments. What happens is - by saying the word 'administration,' that means there is a new four-year-long movie that has been written.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:21:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>The script would then be passed down to people like the CIA and other different agencies, depending on who was going to be playing in this movie. So now this is the part where you hire the actors in the movie. Now there are some actors that play in the movie that are in the face front, such as a president or, you know, different heads of different departments. Even the head that you see on TV of the CIA is not the real head of the CIA, as an example. Nor MI6, nor the SVR in Russia, nor the Secret Service in China.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:22:15</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>No, no, no, no, no. You never see the real head. Now, that is the director. That's the director of that particular section of actors in the movie. Now, whether they know it or not, there's been another set of actors - and most of the time they do, at least on the director level - that there's another set of actors that are also hired to play the villain in the movie. Or maybe they're the villain, and somebody else is hired to play the hero. Just depends on the narrative of the movie, but the twists and turns of the movie and the excitement and all of those fun things for the movie have already been determined.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:23:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>The outcomes have already been determined, and they were probably determined decades before these orders ever got passed down. So by administration, you can exchange the word 'administration' with the word 'movie.' It just happens to be that, depending on what country you're in - because the term is not the same as it is in the U.S. - but this is a four-year-long movie. They hire the actors, they then pay the actors. Now the actors, such as the CIA in this case, and the military, are paid by the movie... liaisons.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:23:48</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So the scriptwriter puts out the script, in part very compartmentalized, piece by piece to all the different actors in the movie, and then he would have paid for it. And by he, I mean Marduk. Then it gets passed down through the actors guilds, and you could call these people the managers of acting people. And they would be like your Order of the Black Sun, your Order of the Dragon folk, and your Langley 5s, eventually, and on down the road, and Parents.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:24:20</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But again, they're just hired to do the administrative duty for four years. That's it. So, because of that, the militaries and intelligence agencies and whatnot, they have directors and they have managers and they have waterboys, and they have all kinds of things underneath them that are set to play the role in the movie, whether they know it or not. Who knows?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:24:52</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>You know, without any Covens, or Coven Masters or anything playing the game - maybe they thought they were the directors of the movie, I'm not sure - or the scriptwriters even. But no, alas, no. So, that particular group of actors guild, so to speak, is not part of the other actors guild we call politics - they are kept very, very separate. Finances are kept separate, the media is actually kept separate, the intelligence agencies and militaries are kept separate. Everything is kept separate, and they're all separate actors guilds that play in the movies.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:25:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, clearly this movie that we just saw here just a little bit ago is just bad acting. Stupid, ridiculous, say absolutely nothing, bad acting. That's a 'B' movie. I don't even know if they make 'C' movies or, like 'F' ones? Because that looked like an 'F' movie to me, wink wink. You know what I mean?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:26:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And on the other side, you have the financial sector, who also got passed down orders and instructions to play their part in the administration. And then, of course, there's a global movie that's happening all at the same time. And you can look at these almost like simultaneous mini-series running - it would be like if all seasons were running all at the same time - of a mini-series.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:26:31</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So I'm not sure why everybody is confused about this all of a sudden, but I do know why the Trump administration is doing it - it's because Rothschild told them to. They said that they lost control over the agencies. They're not able to pay the agencies directly, so they're going to put on a new face.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:26:52</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>See, Rothschild is very good at the new face game. When they can't do something or they fail at something, they put someone in front of you that you think that you would like - that you would trust - and you sell them a bill of goods. But it's still the same movie, still the same script.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:27:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Problem is is that there's no more scriptwriters. That's the other big problem that they're having. There's no more scriptwriters, and most of the other upper folks that were 'in the know' know that there's no scriptwriters. So what you're seeing is a bunch of haphazard, crazy, bad, bad acting because there is no actual script. So everybody's kind of at the improv right now. And the Rothschilds are also at the improv, so are the Chinese Li family and the Russians and the Iranians - everyone's at the improv.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:27:49</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And they show up every day, you know, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, which are typical paydays, especially new moons and planetary parades like the ones today, and they start playing their parts, or what they think they're supposed to play. And then they pick up the phone, and they think they're going to be getting paid for this acting job because they used to always get paid for the acting job. Maybe some of them don't even know where the money comes from. Who knows? Clearly they don't. You know, if they did a little bit of research, everybody's got the information. Everybody knows where the money's come from for the last 12 years.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:28:28</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>The fact that they claimed that it was them is their fault because why can't you - if it was really you, then why can't you perform again? Yep, and people are starting to figure it out, and the jig is up. So it looks like there's a lot of... How do I say this in the nicest of ways? There are some disagreements, some very heated, hot disagreements going on between, well, most of the entire world and the Trump administration right now because the movie is not paying, the actors aren't getting paid, and some of them are walking off the stage or out of the studio because there's no pay. They've realized they don't even have a contract with any of these people anymore.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:29:26</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>If they bothered to look, and some of them have, they've realized they don't even have a contract. There's no contract between the U.S. government per se - whatever you want to call that, the other actors guild - and the other side of the actors guild we know as the military CIA, DNI, Homeland Security, the NSA, insert intelligence agency here, MI6, MI5, you know, the BND in Germany. I mean, you can keep going around the world, every single country. They are an agency without a country - they're on an island unto themselves. That's pretty much where they are at.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:30:08</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>They thought, or were under the impression, that they could get Tom Melville to come and help them clean up. Because everybody's questioning the fact that they don't have any clearance to do what they're doing. And yeah, that's never going to happen. If Tom were to make that decision, he would be stripped of his clearance immediately, and he knows that. Because again - I will repeat - we do not work with or for the Trump administration.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:30:43</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>[What I mean] by 'administration' is: we are not a part of that movie. We have decided to not participate in any kind of payments of the 'actors guild,' because then Rothschild's going to say, 'Ah, we did it.' And the Trump operators are going to say they did it - and then they're going to try to take over the world and hopefully get all this money together and bankrupt everybody and burn the place to the ground - World War III and all the other plagues and everything else they'd like to do.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:31:12</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And that would be a 'No.' That's a 'No' from me. We're not interested in social crediting programs or anything that was written in a script that we are not a part of. See, even actors in a movie get to decline a position, and then maybe another actor will pick it up. As far as we're concerned, we're not acting in a movie. We're over here in real life. We have to get up every day. We have to work really hard. We have to, you know, we make our money. We are retired, whatever we are. We have families to raise, grandkids to, you know, enjoy. We have lots of things to do in our lives that do not include anything coming from the government.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:31:54</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So that being said, the other argument I then had was, "What does the federal government do?" Insert country name here, it doesn't matter. If you're a federation, a socialist republic - it doesn't matter where you are - what do they do? Now, your police forces and your fire departments and all that stuff, that's city and state or province depending on where you are. What does the federal government do?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:32:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And why do we call them the federal government? Why do we call it the republic? You know, we don't even have a government - even the White House doesn't belong to the 'U.S. Government,' if there is such a thing - they belong to Crown Corporation. I explained that within the last couple of weeks on the GIA report.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:32:48</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So we have no financial government aspects in any way, shape, or form. We have no militaries and agencies departments of government. We have very little - maybe about 15 different government departments out of the hundreds, if not more, departments that the U.S. has - and it's redundancy, redundancy, redundancy. And I understand that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:33:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>However [lengthy chuckle], you know, at one point in time I did put out a plan. Which I gave, which eventually made its way to Langley 5. Also, others have put out plans - namely a few people around here locally - they put out some plans, too, on how they would clean up the government. But see, what they forgot is that all those plans involved, well, me, really. Without the pocketbook, without everything to change things, without real negotiations, without real talks about who's going to do what - in the 'new movie,' so to speak - then I don't know where they're going.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:34:09</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>See, the Trump operatives are really good at claiming they have done everything. And this is just part - just like they play deny, deny, deny, reassess [redirect] blame - they also play the other way around, where they claim, 'We did that, we did that.' Anything positive that happens, or extremely brutal that happens, they claim that they did it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:34:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Well, this one here, I don't think they're going to get out of this one. You know, saying 'This is what I want, this is what I want,' and all this kind of stuff is not exactly what I want, see - because I understand where these people have been for decades. And I also understand that there has to be some kind of an amenable plan. Problem is, is they can't afford to pay for anything amenable, so they just keep flying in like pigeons on a chessboard, knocking all the pieces off and declaring they won and fly away.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:35:09</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Well, those little pawns on the chessboard aren't too happy right now. And there appears to be a mutiny - because they're saying, "We're not doing it." "Do we have a contract with you?" "We don't actually work for you." I'm not so sure they're happy about the other people they used to work for either. But in this particular case, they have been lied to again. They believe Trump is the Pindar of the Order of the Dragon and that Elon Musk is the head of the Order of the Black Sun, and that couldn't be further from the truth.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:35:39</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>They thought they had a trifecta of power there - and they certainly don't. But again, they just claim that everybody is anything - and everybody just believes them. And you know, as far as I'm concerned - from looking from over here in the seats that I sit in - that looks like a train wreck.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:36:00</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>You know how, like, when you see you have a good friend or a family member or even one of your children, and you see that they're gonna make a mistake. And like, I used to say to myself when my daughter was doing something, I would be like, "Oh, that's not gonna end well," but I wouldn't tell her, unless I'm like, "Is she gonna die of this?" No. But maybe this is something she needs to figure out for herself. And then, you know, as it goes on longer and longer [chuckle], you can start to hear the whistle of the train that's about to run them over. You know the whistle and the headlight and the choo-choo. They're like, woo-hoo, here it comes. Oh boy! [laughing] Oh boy, here comes that train that's about to run you over, or the bus or whatever it is.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:36:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And yep, I can definitely, I can smell the coal burning, you know - if it was an older train, of course - I can smell the coal burning, I can hear the whistle blow, and I can see the headlight coming, and the train tracks are starting to rumble and yeah - because everybody's turning away from them. And this weekend it's going to get really bad. I'm not sure if it's going to hit any kind of mainstream, but with the little things, you know, the hacks on the State Department and the, was it the Department of Housing or something that happened? Everybody looked the other way.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:37:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>There's a lot of ridiculousness - the other videos with Trump kissing Elon Musk's feet, and now this crap show that they're putting together. See, this is what happens when bad scriptwriters or actors try to write their own scripts - sometimes it really doesn't work out. This is not working out. This is a definite 'C' movie, for sure. Bad acting.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:38:00</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Okay, a little bit more I have for you today. 'Parade of Planets' is something that is happening today. And in the past - when there's an alignment of planets and there's space junk on each one of those planets - then normally there would be, it's kind of like a... something lining up, you know, that perfect lineup, and then the space junk kind of triggers itself, and then usually it would trigger some other type of an event.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:38:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now the space program folks and all the other folks, they might have been aware of some of these things that would happen in the past, and they always have high expectations. But they didn't put the stuff there, and I'm not so sure they know exactly what the stuff actually would have done anyway. It's not there anymore, so really nothing happened today. If anything, they're having a hard time figuring out why they're losing more and more. They're losing grids that were there, or at least the fact that they could see said grids and perhaps try to utilize them to send out negative frequencies and the like, but the grids are going away. Hopefully we'll be done with grids here shortly.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:39:28</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>They don't really have any access to see anything anymore, financial or otherwise. You know, things are getting pretty slim. Their access, their ability to see, is getting really, really slim at this moment in time. So, if anything, this Parade of Planets was more like a death march for the Deep State, as things go away, you know, their power goes away, their credibility goes away. You know, it's kind of like a country song, isn't it?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:40:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>While we, on the other hand, get to play the country song backwards. We get our planet back, we get our humanity back, we get our clean air back, you know. Yeah. Sometimes, karma is a real, you know, what they call her, that 'B' word. And yeah, we're definitely starting to see ours. And I know it might not feel like it, but things are definitely turning around for the better, and it's all in the name of operations on our part. And as I said, you know, a lot of times Source makes us look smart, but in reality it's been a lot of hard work and a lot of pinching and moving, and moving at the right times and strategies.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:40:59</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>You would have thought that light would have dawned on Marblehead for these people a little sooner, but it hasn't. And it's starting to happen - it's finally starting to happen. As for militaries and agencies around the world and treasuries around the world, and the Fed - the Fed is even trying to look at making some different decisions.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:41:22</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>I'll never forget the story of the frog and the scorpion because I look at all of these people like scorpions. Thus far, any kind of dealings I've had with any of these people in the last - over a decade; it's been over a decade that I've done business with these people - and not once in - oh, 13 years or so - have they ever done the right thing. [Not once] have they ever done any good business, really, in any way, shape, or form.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:42:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So... mmm, you know, we're... we're willing to make a slow crawl, let's put it that way. You know, we start somewhere, we've got to see where it goes. You know, do I think that they might be putting on a show? It's possible. I mean, they really love their whatever that is in the White House, I'm sure, and whoever is above them, as you know. And I'm not so sure.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:42:27</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>I'm not so sure we could see useful... departments at this point. There's been a lot of hacking going on over the last few days, and I expected that. Langley 5 is still trying to run the show over there. Yeah, that wouldn't work under a different scenario in any way, shape, or form. There might be some retirement pay - you dip your toes in the water, you lose your pay.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:43:00</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>I don't know. Maybe there's a negotiation that can be had. But as far as us and moving forward on our end of it, these are side notes to the real show that's going on here on Earth. And we all have a job to do, and our job has nothing to do with governments; it has nothing to do with Orders and Dragons and intelligence people or any of these people. Our job is to restore planet Earth.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:43:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And by 'restore planet Earth,' that means that reconnection to Source. That reconnection of you to Source as humans. That clearing of the Dark Matter throughout the Multiverse; clearing of the Dark Matter that existed on this side of the Multiverse - even throughout the Omniverse in a lot of cases. So, we're doing a bang-up job. I mean, you've got to remember some of this stuff has been in place, in earth years, for billions of years. And we're doing a good job. And I know a lot of you are helping, and so I wanted to say thank you for that, too.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:44:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>We are definitely looking at this sometimes through rose-colored glasses, meaning we're looking at it through day-to-day struggles and all of these types of things, and I know they exist. But compared to struggles that humans have seen in the past, this isn't nearly as bad as you think it is. But waiting for a savior doesn't really work out either. You know, we are the saviors.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:44:47</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>We have a lot of work ahead of us, even once we get into what you see as restoration. There is a lot of work to do. The planet is a mess. We as humanity are a mess. We have a lot of triage to do - we have a world full of people with PTSD that are hopefully going to get a little healing from the love and kindness and Light of Source. But it's still going to be - it's going to take a lot of us to turn the ship around. But I know you're up for it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:45:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>As far as all this sideshow, it is just a sideshow at this point - I don't think they're going to achieve any kind of major mass destruction anymore. There might be little things here or there, but I don't know - you know, all this stuff costs money. Just because the United States currently owes Iraq billions and hundreds of billions of dollars, it really doesn't make a difference when some representative, Joe Wilson, puts 'MIGA' on a tweet - because the Iraqi people, quite frankly, could give a [blank] less.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:46:04</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And they have long memories too, and they remember. And some of them aren't even that long, you know, where they have incited riots and all that kind of stuff in Iraq. It's been going on for decades now. They don't forget all of the orders under Dick Cheney. They don't forget the ghost flags; they don't forget the green zones. They don't forget - even the Americans that were over there during that time, you know, that went hunting for WMD and there's no weapons of mass destruction anywhere to be found - and they sent them on wild goose chases because they weren't supposed to find anything, and there never was anything in that particular area. You know?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:46:46</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>There's been a lot of things. But making a little tweet there, Mr. Wilson, with the promise of putting Trump's face on a $250 bill, ensures one thing: How are you going to have a crypto president when you're still issuing currency? With anybody's face on it for that matter - new bills or otherwise? Yeah, you're probably not. I mean, which one are you? One thing is for sure, Mr. Wilson probably has a little-boy crush on Trump - or whatever that is in the White House - or has been promised a whole ton of money. You know, those Fort Bragg-ers tend to really like this administration, or this particular movie, because they think it's going to pay them out great big payouts - that just never seem to come.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:47:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Anyway, on that note, I hope all of you have a wonderful weekend and happy first day of March. Hopefully you'll have a nice weekend. I've got a lot of work to do this weekend. I think tomorrow's going to be a very interesting day, and we should have a very interesting report on Monday.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:47:56</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>On that note, enjoy your night, and I'll see you on Monday.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:48:01</small></small>
