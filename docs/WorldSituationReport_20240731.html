World Situation Report
<br>2024-JUL-31 News</h2>

<!-- TEASER:-->

<h3>And now, the World Situation Report, with Kimberly Goguen from the Office of the Guardian. Tensions escalate in the Middle East yesterday based on funding that was promised from the organization Act Blue, and the U.S. claims they have killed Hezbollah and Hamas leaders during the strikes. But did they? More Secret Space Program military operatives come out of the woodwork for Lions Gate than we've seen in a long time. Their main focus is on opening the Gate to Hell, in Israel.</h3>

<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Now here is Kimberly Goguen with the Office of the Guardian. Hi Kim, it's good to be with you live on the news!
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>I know. It's good to see you too again, Sunny. I missed you.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>I missed you too!
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Your smiling face, always brightens my day. I know it brightens all our viewers days too.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>So what's going on, Kim?
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>You know, it's just that time of year really. Lots of stuff in the regular news. So we'll kind of start with that and let you know kind of what's been happening. So Monday night I talked about - Monday night my time - I talked about some things that were starting to brew in the Middle East a little bit. What I couldn't figure out is where the money was coming from, which we have. So we'll start with events that you know in mainstream news, and then we'll talk about what happened behind the scenes that made all these things possible.
<br>
<br>So allegedly there was a strike from the Hezbollah to Israel, which allegedly hit some children - of course, mostly children - at a soccer match. Thus far, we have been unable to confirm that it hit anyone, if there was actually a strike. So we're still looking for that. We're not seeing what they're saying. Then, allegedly, Israel struck Lebanon in retaliation. Allegedly, they had killed at that time one of the leaders of Hamas, a top general in the - sorry, in Hezbollah. Sorry, my mistake. Hamas didn't come until last night, where allegedly they killed, there was a strike in Iran where allegedly they killed a leader of the Hamas.
<br>
<br>Now, days before this event was to take place, they were actually moving around the leader of Hamas and the leaders of Hezbollah to safe locations for extraction to... Belize! Where they can join the rest of the non-dead people, sipping cocktails on the beach, and probably snorkeling and whatever else people do in Belize these days. So everything that is happening is pre-arranged.
<br>
<br>Next. Today, a fake Khameini - because the real Khameini is dead, let me just reiterate that; we have another masked man running around, no surprise to us. He died probably over a year ago, I think, in Russia, and it was over some kind of magic event he was trying to do there. So he announces today that they promised revenge in order to keep this charade going in the Middle East.
<br>
<br>00:36:47
<br>
<br>Now, as far as operatives are concerned, and why the Pentagon went in - there was about seven ships between U.S. and UK off the coast of Lebanon, and they had really intended to go into full-on warfare overnight last night. However, there was a lot of situations that ended up happening: whereby backup generators weren't working on ships; there was no communication lines; things started malfunctioning; some of the ships had to be extracted by other ships in the region because there was no power. There was lots of things that were happening that were kind of unusual. In addition to that, the parties giving the orders, flying around in planes over the Middle East, also started malfunctioning and were forced to land. There is other situations that happened in the U.S. where some people were locked into a base underground facility, and where they had themselves - they were planning on running control and command from there. They also are in time out. They have been unable to open the door, and they are stuck in one particular room. So congratulations to the 'Lords of War'. You had your five minutes of fame in the Middle East and that's all you're going to get. To the point, why? Why now? Why all of the sudden?
<br>
<br>00:38:35
<br>
<br>Allegedly - not allegedly, this is actually a fact - the operatives were looking for money to get this World War started. They're really having a strong intention of World War III. Why? We're not sure. Maybe it's some old order they had. I don't know. But the Lords of War - and I say this for a reason - are pounding their war drums all over the place right now. So they decided to flash money from a company which is allegedly a nonprofit, but then it also says, when you donate to this particular organization, that your donations are not tax deductible. So I have no idea if it's a nonprofit legally, not a nonprofit, I'm not sure. The company is called Act Blue. Have you ever heard of Act Blue? It is an extreme left-wing organization that promotes democratic causes around the world. And was also influential back in the days of George Floyd and the shooting, and they did a lot of funding to Black Lives Matter and other groups like that. The Black Panthers, and at that time when they were really trying to get this whole racial thing going on in the United States again, very similar to the Ferguson incident. They're also known to do a lot of funding for and through George Soros, Berkshire Hathaway, and a number of other groups, and to a number of other groups, to promote an agenda.
<br>
<br>00:40:30
<br>
<br>Now. Act Blue, in the world of Color Wars, means you are dealing with the Blue Dragon Family and the Blue Eagles, and that means you're also dealing with Rothschild. So you could call it a Rothschild fundraising center to promote their agenda all over the world. You would see the likes of people like Hillary Clinton involved in Act Blue, and now Kamala Harris, and a number of other folks. The website is very nondescript when you go on there; it talks about strange agendas or strange union things. It doesn't really look like they have a clear-cut plan. It just looks like they would be promoting things that people would like, and it's like a menu of where you would like to donate, [which] is what it really is. And you can look it up. I think it's 'Act Blue dot something.' And so I've seen a lot of activity over the years coming from this organization. But the website claims that, since 2004, I think it was, they have raised over $14 billion.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Oh my God!
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yeah, and counting.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>From donations? They're claiming that people donated that much?
<br>
<br>00:41:52
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Some people, yeah. Some people we would probably question whether or not they were actually people, but yeah. Yeah, that's what they claim, and that's what they're claiming on their website. It doesn't mean that it hasn't been a whole lot more, in the past when they had access to a whole lot more to promote certain agendas. But right now it looks like it's a front, in my opinion, for agencies and operatives. It has always been used for, let's just say, acts against humanity. I wouldn't actually call it a terrorist organization, but they definitely have funded activities that would be considered by not only people in the United States, but also abroad, as acts against humanity.
<br>
<br>So at the time when this money was being promised and not yet delivered, it looked like there was about two to three billion dollars in there, a little over 2.7, 2.8 worldwide, because they're a laundromat. So you had to look under rocks to figure out how much money they actually had. And spontaneously, strange things happen all over the world - everything just disappeared yesterday, and therefore money that was promised to say the Pentagon for their participation, and other organizations now no longer saw the 'flash cash', I call it 'flash cash' where they just show "Look how much money we have! As soon as we get this war started, there'll be much more than this! Everybody will be participating in this war!" And yeah, it just disappeared, and it's really sad. And then, all of a sudden, 99% of the activity in the Middle East stopped.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Just stopped, yeah. [smiling]
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Just stopped. I don't know. It was hot and heavy for a couple of hours yesterday, in the afternoon my time, but after that, boom!
<br>
<br>00:43:56
<br>
<br>Now. Part of the reason - now I can also tell you another part too, which is critical to relay. So during this Lions Gate time, there have been things - and I'll get into more detail in a little bit - there have been things that have shown up randomly, that were standing orders from demons of the past, that no longer exist. But it doesn't mean there isn't (like I said) consciousness that was transferred into computer systems, which then creates events. So one of those events is a line, and it has a long name to it, but that was gifted to militaries around the world. I'm calling the Parrot Line - P-A-R-R-O-T, which stands for basically for a communication line that was used, or would have been used, for the return of non-human beings that would have happened on this particular Lions Gate. So they were using this line to communicate throughout the world and to those in the Middle East, and for the last probably 24/48 hours we just saw it pop up. And it died yesterday about as quickly as it came. So without that Communications they were struggling with communications in this particular area of the world.
<br>
<br>00:45:25
<br>
<br>Next. Those of you may remember what was happening in 1983 in Lebanon, if you've been around for a while. That's all the bombings in Beirut, and it hit the news; it was all over the place at that time. Well, also, it was an opportunity for the United Nations basically to install the satellite systems for the nation, per the order of Rothschild, who runs their banking system very heavily there in Lebanon. Yesterday, for a brief period of time, there were a lot of reports on not only social media but also behind the scenes that they had cut the global positioning satellites for the entire country. And this was even for apps like 'report your location on Instagram', or 'look up directions to this place' - for even everyday users.
<br>
<br>Those satellite systems are no longer the United Nations'; they actually belong to us now. Not only there, but in several other areas. And the military no longer has backdoor access to it. So now everybody has GPS to find all of you people. Yep.
<br>
<br>Next thing. Militaries around the world have always been able to hide their tail numbers for aircraft. Meaning, it will say - even if you're like on normal Flight Tracker and those kind of things - it would say, "not applicable" or "unidentified", and you can usually judge by the type of plane that it actually is, like that's probably military, or a helicopter, or a drone. Now that is no longer the case; all those will be visible for everyone in the whole entire world. So everybody will know where you are - and you can't change it, either. So - that's the military. So congratulations!
<br>
<br>00:47:25
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>So that was something in the computers that you were able to change? So they no longer have the ability to hide who they are, basically?
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yeah. We can convert those; one is a backbone satellite system, and the other one is a backbone for the FAA worldwide. So because they had their own insert in there, they had the ability to almost go in like a back door and choose selectively which tail numbers to clear to come into the U.S. or to go out to another country. It was, let's just say, another level of Customs and Border Patrol. So now you will be standing there naked everywhere. So if they choose to continue on this operation, which is why I also suspect, not because I'm looking at Flight Tracker, but because I'm looking at the backbone flight system, which is why I also suspect that the alleged strike in Iran did not actually come from an alleged airstrike, I highly doubt it - unless somebody was on a roof and dropped something. I'm not sure, but nonetheless, more fake leaders are joining other fake leaders in the new Middle East, known as Belize.
<br>
<br>Sunny (laughing):
<br>
<br>That's a popular place!
<br>
<br>00:48:49
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>I know!
<br>
<br>So that being said, the operatives are working very very hard in their fundraising campaign. Act Blue wasn't the only place that they have been talking to. They have also been talking to wealthy Middle Eastern families such as the Al-Thani family of Qatar, the Kuwaiti royal family and the Saudi royal family, and others. In order to really ramp things up there, they need lots of money. And you're talking about, if we're looking at - because they struck Iraq, they also hit Lebanon, Syria, now you've got Iran involved - and this could get very very expensive. When you think about what was going on in Iraq probably more than a decade ago, then you'll know that that was about - at the height of things - you were looking at 50 to 75 million dollars a day. And just in the one country. Now if you're talking about the involvement of several countries, you're talking about somewhere around 175 to 275 million dollars a day, to really fire that up.
<br>
<br>00:49:49
<br>
<br>Now. Lots of royal families have lent money to the United States, to the tune of a few hundred billion dollars in the past - during Gaza and a number of other sectors - in order to get wars going. Now they're expected to throw money in the kitty again. The problem is that most of the Middle East... whether it's... how do I say this... A lot of the Middle East, it's what I call nouveau-riche type attitude, which is your new rich people. They're very flashy, they love having harems of women, many wives, lots of yachts, cars, white horses, racing horses, lots of 'snow' falls in the Middle East, and I don't mean the kind that comes from the sky. They may not be drinkers there because of their religion, allegedly, but that also is not true. Lots of things float around the Middle East all the time. And it's very, it's very flashy... very "I'm the man" kind of thing. Most of the royal families that are installed - and I say 'installed' for a reason - in various countries there right now, are predominantly the line of Rothschild, so we know that they're related to a demon, whether they know it or not. And they have all participated heavily over the last few years. Now you're getting to the point where you're cutting into their lifestyle. And they are not happy in any way, shape, or form. Therefore, the 'donations' that they believe that they are required to make in order to get this war going are just not there.
<br>
<br>00:52:00
<br>
<br>So yesterday, an associate of mine was basically threatened to call me and demand that I give allocation numbers to old historical accounts that are not at the Saudi National Bank anymore and that are not at the Central Bank in the United Arab Emirates anymore. So they can release this money. Now, that money hasn't been there for a long time. It has glitched. I know that, back when we were talking about that Web 555 incident [2024-JUL-08-WSR] about a week or two ago that went down, that they were showing money there for a time and then it disappears, and they show money and it disappears, but they're never able to spend a dime or even get a credit line against it, because it's not actually real. So they were threatening - this is the Qatari royal family - was actually threatening us yesterday to make this money good, to release this money to them, and then they agreed that they would offer us, once it was done, a lofty two percent. Well, and I will stress it again, people of the world, two percent, that offer went out the window a long time ago, my friends number 1, and number 2 currency does not fund wars, so you would have lost it anyway as soon as you got it.
<br>
<br>00:53:29
<br>
<br>Next. I don't work for you people. And I know that they are very - these people are very - number 1. I'm a female, so it's automatically a cultural situation there - women are good for one thing, and it doesn't involve business 99 percent of the time. Number 2, they develop the rules of bakshish. Bakshish is when it's considered a gift, or a monetary transfer to another party, from another person. That's what the word technically kind of means. But in reality, when you're negotiating with any of these royal families, they will sit there all day with you as long as you give them enough bakshish up front. And negotiating for them is like a sport - you give us a donation first, and then I will sit and talk to you. Well, apparently it doesn't go both ways because I basically said, "Hey look, bakshish," and then they open their drawer. That's what they do; I've actually been sitting there and watch this happen. They open their drawer right beside them, and they just point. In other words, please drop cash here.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Oh wow.
<br>
<br>00:54:43
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Oh god, it's awful there, and I'm not saying that the people of the Middle East are terrible, so please don't take that the wrong way. It's just the arrogance of the royal families and whatnot there and how you deal with them. And negotiations I've had with them in the past, obviously as a female, I'm automatically the underdog anyway, number 1. Number 2, they have zero regard for any other human on the planet except for themselves. If you are not of the bloodline of apparently some demon or Solomon, whether they know it or not, you are nobody in this world. And it gets worse the further up you go up the food chain there. But these people are looking for money anywhere. And I hate to break it to you, all of the Middle East, especially the royal families - not all of the Middle East, just the royal families, Khamenei included here, another fake man walking around, trying to drive an entire Shia community. You can all take a long ride on a camel in the middle of somewhere and never come back. Yeah, that's a nice way to put it, right? Get on your camel and go. And by the way, if you ever want to call us again, remember bakshish. You wrote the rules, not me.
<br>
<br>00:56:06
<br>
<br>Okay. Yeah. I actually had some dealings with members of the Saudi royal family in the past, some folks from Syria in the past, UAE, you name it. And yeah, I'd rather actually just deal with the people there. And we'll have our own C.A.R.E. people in the region, that will actually take care of people. And they can ride around on their golden camels or whatever it is they want to do until they run out of money. I could care less. But if you want to continue to fund war, I can tell you, you are gonna care, because you'll be... let's just say, in trouble.
<br>
<br>Okay, next. All right. In the world of crazy Deep State people, or whatever is left of it. This weekend on Sunday marks the new moon, and in the world of Deep State folks, this would be yet another start of another meeting annually. So it appears that whatever's left of the Deep State Generals, Global Headquarters, et cetera, et cetera, are now planning on having their meeting this weekend, starting on Saturday, which will last two weeks.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Their meeting last two weeks?
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Well, they're going to all the meetings, in case something happens. They're going to be having all the meetings by themselves. What they don't realize is that no one's coming. No one's giving you orders, and no one's giving you any money.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Oh, I see.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>But they're doing a reenactment, because they're the only ones left now. So there's no Draco. There's no Parents. There's no Covens, their Family Masters, so they're taking all the meetings as we go down the food chain here. So they're - they do have another meeting planned for this weekend! (laughing)
<br>
<br>Speaker 0:
<br>
<br>That doesn't sound very productive on their part.
<br>
<br>00:58:05
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Well, here's the disconnect in their heads. They think, and again I'm gonna repeat this, because they think that they could do better than the aliens and the demons and all the other people they used to deal with, directly or indirectly, and worked for, but yet they still go to meetings, expecting somebody to reach out to them.
<br>
<br>Sunny: And help them.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>And help them and give them money.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>No, it doesn't. It makes zero sense to me whatsoever. So part of the reason for the uptick that we've been seeing for the last 24 hours in activity has to do with the fact that the new moon is coming up on Sunday, early morning Eastern time, and these people are having a meeting starting the day before. Yeah. And in the absence of anybody showing up for their special meeting, then they would like to meet with us.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Okay. So someone has reached out for this?
<br>
<br>00:59:16
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Someone actually interesting - and not to me directly because no one wants to talk to me - but they did reach out to Tom Melville to have a conversation. Wanted to have it super secret. They're now desperate to have a conversation; I hear that they might be heading in his direction. He was already warned, apparently, by the time I sent him a message. And yeah, they're desperate to have a conversation with Tom. Nobody wants to talk to me, but they would like to talk to Tom. My guess would be they're looking for information because they want to know what they can and cannot do, I'm not sure, to make their meeting go well. They would like to take the place of the aliens. This is people above Majestic clearance, higher level clearance levels, above NATO, above Global Headquarters, that's who these people are. These are the people that are now declaring they're in charge. I'm guessing they think that... because none of these people really before have ever come forward with positive intentions of doing something different. All they know is they'd like to be in charge of something. And that is the mess that you see them creating.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>When does Lions Gate wrap up, Kim?
<br>
<br>01:00:42
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Well, allegedly, according to the internet, it will peak on the 8th of August, and then pretty much the alignment will be over on the 12th. That's what the internet says. We'll see with all the changes, because things have been changing, obviously, on this planet. And that alignment doesn't mean what it used to mean anymore. We've had a little tougher time this year than we have any other year, based on past orders from various demons and other things that were still stuck in the Omega system, but not terrible.
<br>
<br>Difficult things that have taken place. Okay, well, yesterday we saw a huge uptick in activity from Monarch Military, Arsaka, Montauk - you know, all of these SSP folks - and they were all in the Middle Eastern region in various locations. Kurdistan for one, small little villages in Iran in the middle of nowhere. We saw them at the Mar, M-A-R space, Saba, S-A-B-A monastery in Bethlehem yesterday. And under Jerusalem as well, Temple Mount. And they go to these various places because, according to their information, wherever they get it from, these are the places where the gates to the Lower Astral are going to open, like they used to every year in Israel. That was the main place in the world where a gateway would open to the Lower Astral.
<br>
<br>01:02:36
<br>
<br>Now, how that was done actually, by, let's just say 'non-human' beings was, the gateway of Source for the entire planet basically is that border between Iran and Iraq - that's the main gateway. So they would create the appearance, during this time, of an overlay and an underlay on that gate, which would be able to utilize the energy coming directly from Source - the direct current - to then transmute that current and open up a gateway in another location not too far away; in our world, that's not too far away, over in Israel. So did we have a few little things pop up there that they thought were for their pleasure, of course? Yes, we did. They were short-lived, lasted maybe an hour or two hours, that was it - done, dusted, dead people - and that was it. This was yesterday. As the war was going on, this was going on at the same time, and ... it does cause a - you know I would say that I actually found the people underneath Mar Saba Monastery because of the giant stab in the head I got at the time they tried to fire up the machine. I guess they figured I was the first target, I don't know. Yeah, but God rest your souls and have a nice day. And that was the end of that.
<br>
<br>01:04:18
<br>
<br>But hopefully, we're nearing the end of things being able to... how do I say... during this time of year, this will be the last year we ever experience any kind of, a little bit of an eruption. And compared to what would normally happen this time of year, it's not that bad. It's really not. So hopefully, between now and the 8th, there'll be nothing disturbing our direct current anymore. Like I said before, a couple steps forward, a couple steps back, a couple steps forward, a couple steps back, and it is a fight - not with human beings, I mean, these people are just going along with the flow of Dark energy. They like that.
<br>
<br>So yeah, we'll see what happens, if these people actually show up to the party - right now I have 'negative zero' confidence in these people. Based on the orders that they've been giving for the last few days, yeah, no - not even a little bit of confidence at all. You still have people running around with Rothschild's full Rolodex of terrorist organizations they can fire up. Making deals, sending people off to Belize for retirement. This has been going on since Hitler retired in Argentina, died of old age, some kind of natural cause, etc, etc. It's an old game, and they're playing the same exact game. One minute I think it's Desert Storm, the next minute I am back in 1983. How old are these people running this beep show, you know?
<br>
<br>01:06:10
<br>
<br>So every move that they're making now has already been made before, this is not a surprise. Very predictable. So hopefully things will be calm now, or calmer, in the Middle East. We won't see as major of a situation, I hope, that we saw in Gaza. We will continue to see who else plans on funding them, but one thing is for sure: it won't be us, not directly or indirectly.
<br>
<br>I do know for a fact - here's one other thing I'll put out there to you: some of these Lords of War are trying to get people to come to me to get funding for their affairs. Indirectly. Singing songs of sunshine, and we love you, and we've really been looking at following you, blah blah blah. That's happening. Number 2, they would like me to be their cannon fodder for all the stuff they're doing. So they actually tried, at one point in time, to put some accounts in my name. That was the plan for this Act Blue money as well - they were gonna launder it into my name, and then pay terrorist organizations so they could set me up. (Sunny gasps.) I know. And you know what? This has never happened before!
<br>
<br>Sunny (hearty laughter):
<br>
<br>Just like all their other plans, that are just repeating from years past!
<br>
<br>01:07:54
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yeah, I was totally shocked! I've never seen this one happen to me before! I've never been set up by Bush senior either. I was never set up by any of these people before. No, never! But congratulations! Here's the problem I have with operative sometimes, and these are the ones that are playing the Lords of War. Here's a problem I have with you: I've already played all your games! And actually I played those games with the people who taught you, and created those games in the first place! So why are you... you know? I mean, it's okay. You know what? I already got your number. I already got your books. I've already got - I know where you're going next; I know how you're gonna try to set me up next. I know for a fact that you're telling terrorist organizations that I didn't pay them, so they couldn't get paid, so that they'll come here, and we'll have Durango, Colorado full of insert-terrorist-organization here. I already know what you're going to do because I've already done this before.
<br>
<br>So I will counteract you every step of the way. I too have people all - I've got my own little contacts, I've got everything I need to reach out to any one of these humans. Matter of fact, I even have friends in Belize. I can make them the welcoming committee for your people that you just sent down there, who will then call all their other people, and tell them what's going on. So you know what? If there's a game, go ahead and continue to play. Let's play, boys and girls, because I can tell you I'm going to run over you like a freight train.
<br>
<br>01:09:32
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>You know what I think we should do? I think we need pictures of those people in Belize, and just spread it everywhere online - where they can't control it.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>I know! I mean, I can call some people down there, and see what we can do. Have some cocktails on the beach.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Seriously. You know, the news, I know we can't get it, shown probably on mainstream media or whatever, but there are people that will just repost. Let's give them some proof that these people aren't dead, and that these people are just lying.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Exactly! And if you happen to be - and I actually, I'll go ahead and give you, I'll write it down, so make a note and I'll tell you exactly where they are - and that way we can get many people on social media posting this.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>That's right.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>I mean yeah, they're in a secured area there, but I'm sure you can get on a boat - they're always sitting on the beach hanging out, so you can probably get on a boat with a little long-range camera, and start taking some pictures from the sea. Sure.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>We need some paparazzi down there is what we need. From Hollywood! Take them down there to Belize!
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>The problem is, is that no one pays for those pictures. See, well paparazzi, they pay to see the stars at their worst, and all this kind of thing. Or to hide the fake pictures, one or the other. Yeah, no one's gonna care. No one cares about those people. Enough to pay for them - or maybe they do, I don't know! Act Blue I hear has money!
<br>
<br>Sunny (laughing):
<br>
<br>I don't think Act Blue's gonna pay for it.
<br>
<br>Kim (laughing):
<br>
<br>Oh wait, they don't! [hahaha]
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Maybe they'll just do it for followers, and 'fame and fortune' online. I don't know.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yeah. Or maybe if we have people watching this from the Middle East they can go ahead and send their people down there.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>We need some pictures people! Pictures.
<br>
<br>01:11:31
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yep. Yep. So we'll see what happens in the Middle East. Khamenei or fake Khamenei or the Khamenei people, people of Khamenei - operatives - are planning on a retaliation. Let's see if they actually do something.  Khamenei is - or the the original Khamenei, I should say. Prior to that it was Khomeini. They are all 1000% of the bloodline of the Order of the Dragon. All of them. They never install a religious leader in any religion, whether it's Catholicism, or Shia, or Sunni, or whomever, that is not one of theirs. It's part of their little trick they do, to try to put as many Lucifer worshippers in religious leading positions in order to... It's kind of a way they trick the people, if they're worshiping a person, versus God itself. It's the same reason why, in some religions, you go to confession to a third-party person. Yep, because you're going through essentially a Luciferian organization. And I'm not, look, this is not about people that go to temple or church or anything like that, in any way shape or form. Because it is you people that are really going there with the best of intentions, and are truly there for God. You're not there for the other people there, you're not there for whoever's standing there talking, you're 100% there because you're trying to connect to our Creator.
<br>
<br>01:13:17
<br>
<br>And that, in my opinion, is the most important thing. And as long as that's your focus and your aim when you go to these places, and you're staying away from those fake people in pointy hats, and other people around the world that claim to be in charge. Also, that's why there's a lot of conflict between the different sects of Jews also in Israel, because some are of that clan and some are not. So there's a lot of fighting and arguing that goes on between those two groups. And a lot of pushback, for that very reason: because they're aware of what's going on there.
<br>
<br>So, like I said, as long as your intention is all of the best in reaching God/Allah/Yeshua/Jesus, wherever you are in the world, there's no harm in going to church. So please don't take that the wrong way. As far as their leadership, they think that they can control the people through their leaders, which is definitely failing anyway. Because people can connect every single night in their room before they go to bed, or in the morning, or in times of trouble in hospitals, or wherever you are in the world, that connection is always there.
<br>
<br>And with the direct current coming in, it's all easier. It's all the more easy to make that connection to your Creator, so they're gonna lose that battle no matter what. That ship is going to sail, retaliation or no retaliation in that region.
<br>
<br>01:14:56
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>You know, and deep down I believe humanity knows that, because if you're ever in trouble, or you think you're going to be hurt, or your child's going to be hurt, or your child is missing, or something like that, it doesn't matter where you are; you do some sort of prayer, or you reach out somehow. So I think that's something that's deep within us that we already know. I think that's just proof we already know that. We're listening to other people saying, "Oh! You got to go to this building and talk to this guy behind this wall and do a cross and say your Hail Marys" or whatever. But I think deep down, we know it's really simple because we do it. We do it when we're concerned and when we need help, but we know no one else can help.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Well you don't know where to look for help. I mean like you said it's something that is - we just have to remember like how that connection really works and how we can get there from here. And as much as putting out the news is extremely important, you'll get all the news eventually, all directly yourself, of what's going on.
<br>
<br>01:15:58
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>I'm going to be out of a job basically, guys!
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>That's right! Let's put us out of a job! There you go.
<br>
<br>Sunny (laughing):
<br>
<br>That's a good thing! I'll find something else, don't worry!
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yeah, we'll find other things to do. Sunny can sing, actually.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>I can't sing! I'd be so bad!
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>You know, I think we're a little ways away from that. But I think with the world rapidly changing, you're actually seeing a lot more of a result when you make those connections. Quicker results. Changes in the world and in your personal life, or whatever it is you're connecting for, than you did before. As long as your whole heart is in it. Really. Your whole heart - mind, body, soul - has to be in that connection. So whether it's meditation and you're saying it's Source, or you're going to pray for a loved one - mind, body, and soul, you have to believe, in yourself and in the Creator. If not then it doesn't quite work out as well.
<br>
<br>01:17:09
<br>
<br>But yep, I'm actually looking forward to some hopefully positive changes over the course of the next 12 days, is what I'm looking for. And the harder we work to make sure that there is no interference, I think the more of a boost that we can expect over the next few days. So that's my hope. My hope is to to ride a positive wave that I see coming in, and no matter how many things - and I'm not even gonna say the dumb humans, meaning the Deep State - no matter how much interference is attempted, it's kind of like when you... if you're in a crowded place or you've got... you've had sleepovers like with your girls, and you've got 20 young girls screaming at you, and everybody wants a different ice cream, or whatever treat, or this or that, or these two over here are fighting, and the noise is just a lot, and you're like, "STOP!"
<br>
<br>Sunny (laughing):
<br>
<br>That's my house in general, Kim. That's the daily thing right there. No party required!
<br>
<br>01:18:24
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>But you can either go for a ride in your car, or you go outside, or you go into the bathroom and put a towel over your head and go, "Make it stop!" You know? And you just have to take those 10 deep breaths and just breathe. And that's kind of how I feel, but on a larger scale with what we've been doing for the last few days, it's like I want to part the waters of confusion and dark energy, and throwups here and there of stuff that was pre-programmed to happen, and just go "Stop!" and then just let that direct connection come through for the Earth and for the world. And that's what I'm hoping to see over the next few days, before we hit the peak. Because we're already in that timeframe, and we have been, even before the 28th. We're not quite fully there yet, as far as that full alignment that happens every year. So hopefully, with a little bit of hard work between now and then, we can take advantage of that peak and really ride that wave.
<br>
<br>So hopefully forever more, and the connection won't ever be lost again. So that's what I'm hoping for.
<br>
<br>01:19:42
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Me too. I'm right with you.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yeah!
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>That sounds lovely.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>And all of you that are right with us, remember, we got to stop the commotion. Just stop! And focus on keeping that gateway clear, best that you can. If you're able to do such a thing, make sure that that direct connection, the extra energy we get every year is now ours, and it's going to feed the entire world life-force energy directly from Source. So keep that in your meditations or prayers every day, if you would, however you make that connection. And yeah, let's ride the good wave, guys.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Let's do it. Okay, thank you Kim. Hopefully we'll see you Friday.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Thank you Sunny.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Okay.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>See you Friday.
