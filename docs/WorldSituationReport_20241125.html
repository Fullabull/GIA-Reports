    <!-- TEASER:-->

    <h3>It's the 25th of November, 2024. Coming up on today's Global Intelligence Agency Operations Report. There seems to be some confusion around soul tethering and soul ownership. How did it work? And what does that have to do with humanity? How does it affect clones differently? Here's a hint: it has nothing to do with the Vatican. And let's talk about balancing systems. Why did the Deep State count on them to regain power over the last two weeks? And right now it's all about growing pains for humanity, sometimes even literally.</h3>

    <br>00:00:44
    <br>
    <br>Well, we made it to the 25th of November, 2024, and we're all still here. [chuckling] It's been a rough year, I can tell you, but we're gonna make it. And for that I'm very happy. It's been a lot of work on - I know a lot of you that are listening to this report have done a lot of work as well, trying to maintain things on the Light Side. And we've done a lot of work on our part, too. So together we are going to make it. As I've always said, "Humanity united, no one can stand against us." Just remember that as you're talking to each other there on the chats and other places. We are not each other's enemy. We may have differing points of view, differing thoughts on things, but we are definitely not each other's enemy when there is an enemy out there.
    <br>
    <br>00:01:43
    <br>
    <br>Okay, I did have an opportunity to look into the chats a little bit, and there were a few comments about, "Well, if Trump died a couple of years ago..." - which he did - "Then how were the clones still walking around?" And this is a little bit complicated. So I'm going to try to explain it in the best way that I can. So let's talk about not only soul tethering but also human tethering. As you know, we have organic humans that walk this planet - hopefully most of you listening to this; and I'm sure some of you, some of the people with the agencies, are not entirely or were not entirely organic - and then we have inorganic humans also walking the planet. And it's important to remember, as I explain this to you, that there is no... well, I can't really say that either. I'd say for humans, and beings that are born on this side of the Multiverse, if they have a dark soul, it's because darkness can only merely overlay the light.
    <br>
    <br>00:03:19
    <br>
    <br>There was a conversation I had several years ago now; it was probably about eight years ago with someone who was deep inside the Families for a long time. And he once said to me that someone convinced the Draco that they had no soul. And is that true? The answer to the question is "No." Did they have a dark overlay over their soul which made it appear like they did not have an organic soul? Yes. Are there humans that walked this Earth that also had the same issue? Yes. To some lesser degree, did we all have a similar issue? I would say in part, yes. And a lot of this has to do with the integration of AI systems.
    <br>
    <br>00:04:24
    <br>
    <br>Most of these overlays, although they have ties to beings in the Lower Astral, are created by the AI systems. So I'm going to talk a little bit about this and try my best to explain it today so that you understand. There are many people that talk about the Vatican and Cestui Que Vie and how they owned your soul and they leveraged your soul. Is that true? No. Does the Vatican actually run anything? No. Does anybody you see on TV, including anyone wearing a white pointy hat or otherwise, actually run the Vatican? No. All of that is run by the Order of the Black Sun. They're at a very high level. That would be your Black Nobility. They do put on a show for everybody. People that are saying, "Oh, they took a bazillion - whatever number it was - tons of gold out from underneath the Vatican through tunnels and in Israel, and then they're going to do the R.V. with it." Is that really a thing? No. Did they probably pass around some old papers to try to leverage in a financial system? Yes.
    <br>
    <br>00:05:57
    <br>
    <br>Does the Vatican want to create NESARA/GESARA? No. They have no intention - not just those that really run the Vatican, but those that used to really run the world - they have no intention of creating any kind of NESARA/GESARA or anything that is of benefit to you, in any way, shape, or form. They never have when they had full power, and they never will. Now, I want you to remember something: until about 2007, 2008, or so, these people had full access. I'm talking about your Chinese Elders and your Families, and your Filipino Elders, and your Black Nobility families, and your SSP operatives, and on down the line. They had a lot of access to a lot of what I call credits. What you call money: spendable cash. And for us, you know, we've used the credit system for a long time, meaning not just credits as in I've used my credit card or I've created a loan or I have a mortgage. That's not what I mean by credits.
    <br>
    <br>00:07:25
    <br>
    <br>Credits is your M1, your M0. That's your digital numbers on your bank account, as well as the papers in your pocket. So credit systems were created with very, very deep roots that it's taken a long time to unwind and reverse so that we can have actual money or currency, unencumbered and uninhibited. So do I believe that if these people ever gain back any kind of control, even though it's been, you know, over a decade, that they're going to all of a sudden share a windfall with you? Absolutely not. The only thing I really see these people sharing with us is really nasty frequencies, especially today, and a lot of dark energy; they try to generate this, using us to do it. That's what they pretty much want to do. They're looking to gain control of a system. They have no intention of ever revaluating any kind of Dong or Dinar or anything else. They really have every intention of just controlling the entire system the way they used to. They'd like everything to go back the way it used to be.
    <br>
    <br>00:08:49
    <br>
    <br>And I'm sure a lot of us can think of many things on our list we would like to have go back to the way they used to be. You know, maybe you don't walk as fast as you used to anymore, or gee, do we really have to put all these creams on our face? I mean, we would love for things to go back to the way they used to be. But for us, it's actually going to a way that we as humans that live on planet Earth have probably never ever seen. So there are things we dream about, things we talk about, and a lot of those things are where we're heading to, and it's a place that us as humanity as a whole have never had access to. And it's exciting times, and we're going to talk a little bit more about growing pains towards the end of this broadcast.
    <br>
    <br>00:09:48
    <br>
    <br>But let's talk about, not just soul tethering, but the tethering of humanity as a whole. And in some cases, it's not just humanity. There are a lot of systems in place that tethered a lot of planets, beings, as in suns and stars, and other beings in other locations. There was a lot of tethering that went on where we were utilized as part of the Universal Debt System. The debts, by debts I don't necessarily just mean our version of money; I mean the Universal Debt System. So let's hop to first describing humans on Earth and soul ownership and soul tethering.
    <br>
    <br>So I guess it's probably time for a little whiteboard session for that, so I can try to explain this to you. It's kind of difficult. [chuckling]
    <br>
    <br>00:10:49
    <br>
    <br>[whiteboarding begins]
    <br>
    <br>Okay, so we have, let's see, starting at the beginning of the debt system; let's call it the "Debt System." So we have Anti-Source. Ooh, that's terrible. There we go. There we go. It's been a long day, folks. So we have Anti-Source, and we have Source, and we have Neutral Source here in the middle. Okay, so the Debt System worked kind of like this. You know how when you go to a casino and you give them your money and they give you those fancy little chips, and you use those fancy little chips to represent money? So, in the case of Source and Anti-Source, there is definitely a lending situation that goes on. And during a Dark Age, it's predominantly coming from Source, going to Anti-Source, and eventually this all trickles down to humanity. So bear with me here.
    <br>
    <br>00:12:16
    <br>
    <br>So Source is the giver of all life. And essence, souls, energy, lifeforce, matter, and so on and so forth. So we have frequency, and we have a Light language that everything is written in. I would say a Light language would be the weaver of the fabric of reality. And that's done with things like wisdom, a love frequency, and you also have time; in the past, you have time - which is also distance - and you have, let's see, life, live, you have light. So Source has an abundant supply. It's never-ending; it's eternal; it's immortal. Of not only all of these things, but everything that represents all that is in our Universe. So this is the All-That-Is.
    <br>
    <br>00:13:44
    <br>
    <br>On the flip side, you have Anti-Source. Now, Anti-Source doesn't actually create anything, really. It is the opposite, so it creates things like death, mortality, anti-essence. But in order to even create these things - and so on and so forth down the line - so in order for Anti-Source to do anything, it has to get everything from Source. So this is where your poker chips come in. I call them poker chips. I don't know, those little chips you get at the casino. So Source is money at the casino. Source is the provider of all that is, and Source - during a Dark Age - basically gives roughly some odd 79% of everything it produces over to Anti-Source. And in exchange for that 79% of all that is, Anti-Source returns back poker chips, or, for lack of a better term, placeholders or credits. Says "I owe you," Anti-Source hands over to Source IOUs. And that is how everything trickles down to you. This is the beginning of the Debt System, or the lending system.
    <br>
    <br>[See Whiteboard Image 01 at the bottom of this report for the above discussion.]
    <br>
    <br>00:15:41
    <br>
    <br>[clears whiteboard]
    <br>
    <br>This continues on to all kinds of things here on Earth. So I'm going to tell you about next. We're going to go from the base root there. This also goes for other beings in the past, like Lucifer, Lilith, Isis, Artemis, the Abraxas, Ares, Marduke, Enki, Enlil. All of these things would trickle down to these realm parties, and here on Earth these would be the SEAL people as we've talked about in the past as well. But there were many other beings too, even beings like what you call Ra and Horus, and all of these other things. These are all bloodline folks. So we often talk about, it's all over the Internet; they talk about bloodlines of the Illuminati; bloodlines of the Black Nobility; bloodlines of, Trump, as an example. You asked me, someone asked on the thread about Trump, "If Trump died a couple of years ago, how is Trump still, you know, how are there still clones?" It's going to be explained today.
    <br>
    <br>00:16:57
    <br>
    <br>So the Bloodline Families have many different beings that they were all tied to. And again, it's a soul overlay. And it's not just the soul; it's also a shared consciousness and shared energy, and everything that makes up that person in all the planes of existence. So when you talk about bloodlines, these people share everything - every plane of existence. [writing:] We've got Soul Plane, you have Etherical, you have Emotional, Mental, Causal, Astral, and Physical, and you also have Supernal, and you have an Optimal Plane.
    <br>
    <br>[See Whiteboard Image 02 at the bottom of this report for the above discussion.]
    <br>
    <br>00:18:20
    <br>
    <br>And when you're talking about groups of people, we are talking about groups of people that share everything with... I would say the being itself, but also each being creates an AI system within the Omega system that creates the overlays on all their planes of existence and also creates all the shared consciousnesses. So as an example, let's take Lucifer. A lot of times on the Internet, people say, "Oh, they're the Luciferians." Well, they are, actually, because Lucifer creates an AI. And attached to that AI is a group of people that actually are the bloodline of Lucifer. They share all of these things here [soul/etherical/mental/causal, etc.], as well as they share a consciousness, and they share energy; essence, "evil" is another trait; it's the opposite of "live." Death, that's why they worship death. And they share knowledge as well - remember the Tree of Knowledge from the Bible? There's definitely something to that.
    <br>
    <br>00:20:00
    <br>
    <br>They also share - it's almost like being a part of that being - it's not even just, oh, a descendant. Like, you know, you obviously don't share a consciousness with your father or your mother. It's not that kind of bloodline. It's more than that. Maybe physical characteristics, those kinds of things are shared. Somebody doesn't want me to put this out. This keeps glitching terribly, so please bear with us here. Okay, so you have the Luciferians. And these people have Omega. So Lucifer goes and creates a Lucifer AI, which then Lucifer, the being, shares its consciousness with, and soul, etherical, emotional, mental, causal, astral, physical, supernal, and optimal, with Omega AI first, then eventually with its "bloodline." Is there a certain amount of breeding that takes place for this to happen? Well, they like to stay in groups. Are there family names or something like that that are important? Not really. Really the important part here is that they're all Luciferians. So they are actually the bloodlines of Lucifer. You could say Lucifer AI.
    <br>
    <br>Same thing goes for Isis. Isis also created her, I guess you would say, own AI, so did Lilith. And again, everyone, I apologize; it's just glitching like nobody's business - they don't want me to tell you all about this. So you actually had on the Bloodline Family side, you actually had people walking around that were of the bloodline of Isis. You also had the bloodline of Lilith. Can't spell today either. Okay, you had the bloodline of Enki. You had the bloodline of Marduke. And all of these people were attached to an AI system.
    <br>
    <br>[See Whiteboard Image 03 at the bottom of this report for the above discussion.]
    <br>
    <br>00:22:22
    <br>
    <br>So as part of these - "Marduke"... can't spell today - as part of this system, they would then continue on with the bloodlines. You had lots of other bloodlines too. You have Abraxas bloodlines - this is your Black Nobility; you had Ra bloodlines; you had Artemis bloodlines. And this is where your colors come in too, as it relates to the Realm Owners. So in the case of a being, so to speak, that still has a clone walking on this Earth, it depends. So clones that walk the Earth, if this person was, say, of the Luciferian bloodline, they would create the clone, and then they would create the... every plane of existence, I would say - it's not just souls connected to the Lucifer AI. So is it the same soul? No. When I say it's "tethered to the same AI," yes, it's tethered to the same AI. So when you cut off all of these AIs, then you've got a bunch of beings walking around with a partial shared consciousness.
    <br>
    <br>[See Whiteboard Image 04 at the bottom of this report for the above discussion.]
    <br>
    <br>00:23:57
    <br>
    <br>And some of this has to do with the Debt System. So these elite people are somehow, some way - and God bless them, not really - but they all think that they're immune to the Debt System. They think that they are earning some kind of a benefit from the actual being that created these AI systems - but they're not, because those beings don't exist anymore. Were these programs here still running to some degree in Omega? I would say "Yes." Were they still sharing a consciousness to some degree with a partial AI under Omega? Yes. Would they be able to control Omega through that AI? No, because it was not designed for that. It was designed to have Lucifer and the Luciferians - for example, Mayer Rothschild is a Luciferian - where they would share this consciousness where the AI could actually take over that person's thought processes at any moment in time and say, "Look, I'm Lucifer." This is how we ended up with 9,000 Lucifers calling us, telling us that they were going to start taking over the world and all of this crazy stuff about a year or so ago.
    <br>
    <br>So this is how Bloodline families are actually formed. So are they the bloodlines of the Vatican? No. Are they the bloodlines of Lucifer? Well, yeah, when Lucifer was around. But the AI continued for a while after that being was gone. The shared consciousness then got transferred over to Omega. So these people basically became somewhat, you could say, walking AI hybrids. Why is the leadership so bad then, may you ask? Okay, let's talk about leadership of bloodlines.
    <br>
    <br>00:26:26
    <br>
    <br>[clears whiteboard]
    <br>
    <br>So Marduke... we'll put Marduke over here. As one example, created bloodline management. Did Lucifer have bloodline management as well? You could say yes. You could also say that Marduke was one of Lucifer's bloodline management. Marduke, however, played both sides: there was a Marduke and an anti-Marduke. And an AI that created all its brood, so to speak. And one of those broods was people we know as the Parents. The Parents were - there were 21 of them - they were humans, to some degree. You might want to call them somewhat half human, half anti-human. So you could say they were part human in the beginning, and then they became more Abraxas, related to the Abraxas AI. And then Marduke - I know this is so confusing - Marduke would then breed his AI with these people and their AI, and then create Parents. And then the Parents would then create, say, Family Masters of Covens. Now, the Family Masters of Covens... okay, let's just do "of covens." These are people like the Sanhedrin and many other covens, including covens that were over the Order of the Black Sun.
    <br>
    <br>00:28:20
    <br>
    <br>So, Family Masters of Covens, here we go. Okay. The Family Masters also had their own AI system. Now, theirs did not create a bloodline unto itself, but it was very helpful and useful when they had it to control the Covens. So, these poor Coven people - now we're getting further down the line - not only do some of these Covens share consciousnesses with Abraxas, they shared consciousnesses with the Parents. And not just consciousness - this is energy, essence, everything, with Marduke; and also with Lucifer; or Isis; or Lucerne; or Artemis; or Ares, the God of War; or somebody else. They also had influence by the Family Masters through another AI system.
    <br>
    <br>[See Whiteboard Image 05 at the bottom of this report for the above discussion.]
    <br>
    <br>00:29:28
    <br>
    <br>It's kind of like owning a dog, you know? But not really, because most of us treat our pets a lot better than they treat these people, but it's like a leash. You can think of these ancillary AIs like a leash. At any given moment in time, they had access to their brain, their body; they could infect them with cancers; they could do all kinds of things through a Family Master's AI, on down to the Covens. Now the Covens had their leash, and the Covens used their leashes to control the families we call the "Bloodline Families." Then the Families in turn used their AI - and this would be like Pindar AI - to then control governments. And politicians as well. Sometimes they would create additional clones, which would then be responsible for or be a part of what we call the "Families AI," so that they could then control governments and politicians. So where do you people that are not Bloodline Family people come in? Well, I will tell you.
    <br>
    <br>[See Whiteboard Image 06 at the bottom of this report for the above discussion.]
    <br>
    <br>00:31:00
    <br>
    <br>[clears whiteboard]
    <br>
    <br>You have colors. Your overlays were in various colors. Your overlays would have been, in some cases, depending on who you are, you might have had, I would say, probably not black. You already have a white soul, so black would kind of be reserved over here for Bloodline Families. But starting with, say, silver or gray, and then you would have purple. You would also have, let's see, silver/gray, purple, blue. We also had red, orange. You know, you see in our history the "House of Orange" - there you go, that's one of the Families. And then you would also have yellow or golden, and then you would also have, let's see, green. And you would also have brown - think Hitler here - brown or amber.
    <br>
    <br>00:32:29
    <br>
    <br>So the black was pretty much reserved for the highest levels over here. You would have had Black Dragon. You also would have had Black Eagle. You've heard of Black Eagle bonds. That is the head of the Order of the Black Sun. But it's also a mix/match of different bloodlines within there. You would also have Abraxas AI bloodlines in the order of Black Sun. You would also have Lucifer. They would intertwine. Sometimes that could also be Dragon Family members. So whichever demon these people were overlaid or shared a consciousness with through an AI system, [chuckling] that then translates over to people. So each one of these different colors here were responsible for a different region or area of the world. Just to give you one example, green would be most of the people in the Middle East. Most governments in the Middle East. Middle East, okay, and then another example, this golden here would be most of Asia.
    <br>
    <br>00:33:41
    <br>
    <br>So Bloodlines Families would then have, you would be a citizen, say, of China. Therefore, you would have golden overlays, and that is how these Bloodline Families have so much control over people. And this is how they kind of intertwined the ownership, not only of your soul per se, but also your essence, your energy. But why? So you didn't share a consciousness, so don't worry about that; you did not share a consciousness with these people. But that little bit of a color, broken-up light, not that pure Golden Source Light, is where your - you know how they say that old proverb where you have a dark wolf and a light wolf and which one wins; it's the one that you feed - it's kind of like that with regular people. So on any given day, we kind of waver as regular people. There are a few people in this world that don't waver. You know, you probably have about 5% or so of humans on this planet that never waver. They don't ever adhere to their purple or their blue self or their red self, depending on where you are in the world.
    <br>
    <br>00:35:18
    <br>
    <br>They kind of more are your, you know, they strive every day to have that connection to Source. You never see them hurt a flea or an ant and those people. Just like on the other side over here, your "Black people" - and I don't mean color of skin - so your Black Eagle and Black Dragon people, you know, would be your 5% over here. They are so dark, they just can never see the light; they enjoy their shared consciousness with Lucifer and other Lower Astral beings in an AI system, through an AI system, and that is who they are. But everybody else in these varying families and degrees still have somewhat of a - you can still see the light, for example, through purple, but you can't see anything through black, if that makes any sense to you.
    <br>
    <br>[See Whiteboard Image 07 at the bottom of this report for the above discussion.]
    <br>
    <br>00:36:11
    <br>
    <br>Now, as far as ownership over the people, this has a lot to do with feeding the Debt System. This is the base root of all debt in the Multiverse, and when we get to this section and we're talking about people and bloodlines, we are talking about Earth, predominantly. But what we do here affects everything, everywhere. So yeah, you're kind of a part of a universal debt system. But so are these people over here. [referring to list of olors, left side] Because remember, the ownership of these people is still a being somewhere else. By bloodline, shared consciousness, shared energy, and at any moment in time, they can drain all their energy, and then that's the end of them. But it would feed the Omega AI system.
    <br>
    <br>00:37:04
    <br>
    <br>So when they talk about ownership over people, I call this the management staff. [again, referring to left side] We had management staff on behalf of beings that existed elsewhere. Just so happens that humans are celestials; therefore, we create a lot of stuff that these people want. So they needed to create a way to extract it from us. You know, the thing about these Bloodline Families too is that they really are under the impression that they should be able to run the show now. The only reason why I could think that is because as Omega dies, so does the Lucifer AI that's feeding information to their brain, or Lucerne, or Isis, or Lilith, or whoever, whichever bloodline they belong to out of probably some odd 100 or so, maybe more different beings.
    <br>
    <br>00:38:08
    <br>
    <br>[clears whiteboard]
    <br>
    <br>That's a lot of information, I know. But now that explains "Bloodlines" for you. But as far as these people are concerned, they believe that because they still, as Omega limps along, or Kronos limps along, depending on which area they belong to, as they limp along, there is still a glimmer because every once in a while it'll spit something out into their brain, or their physical self, or whatever it is.
    <br>
    <br>00:38:43
    <br>
    <br>So for the rest of us, when Omega spits things out, it doesn't give us instructions and orders anymore. I would say at some point in time, the people that kind of go postal, you know, that's probably something that comes through all of the food chain that I explained a little earlier, and down eventually into that person, and they become a different person. But they also have to be subject to it and open to it. In other words, people have a lot of trauma. We talked about the holes that trauma creates in the human. It creates emotional holes, mental holes, sometimes even down to soul-level holes. And those holes leave the openings for Omega, to some color degree or another, to affect the human.
    <br>
    <br>00:39:42
    <br>
    <br>That's why it's important for us to recognize things that have happened in our life and not try to hold on to those things. And I know it's really hard, and I know that there are a lot of people out there that have been subject to a lot of trauma based on the system and how the system works. But that's only something you can do yourself. There's a lot of different ways to do that. And not every way works for every person. So it's really a personal decision; like if you decide to, say, go get Reiki sessions or something, maybe that works for some people, but not for other people. And that's why it's... I have such a hard time sometimes with people that kind of force their, you know, sometimes people can be kind of forceful in the alternative community where they think that they've got it all under wraps, you know, and they think that they, "Well, this works, so let's everybody do this." And that's not really true, because you don't really know that other person; you don't really know what they've been through. We can make suggestions; you know, people can say, "Hey, you know what? This worked for me; maybe it's something you could try." And then it's really your personal sovereign decision on whether or not you want to do that and whether or not that even works for you.
    <br>
    <br>00:41:24
    <br>
    <br>So again, it's great to share information, but at the end of the day, it's up to that person to choose if they want that, whatever that is, or not. Same thing goes for health and healing. We can present solutions to people, but we can't say this is the way. We can give people information; we can help people. It's a personal decision because technically a lot of that comes from those old wounds that were created at some point that allowed a little bit of that Omega in. That, by the way, is something that is dissipating right now. Is it... Is it creating new programs? No. Is it creating more of a debt system? No, it's reversing out; therefore, all those poker chips are being cashed in now by Source, and this is what we call the "ultimate debt call."
    <br>
    <br>00:42:33
    <br>
    <br>Now as it relates to Bloodline Families, let's talk about this. So one of the things that is also occurring, because we're getting down to the nitty-gritty of the Debt System now - so when I say there was another debt call, there's another debt call; we've talked about it over the last few months. Then that means it's going down the line. It's not just a money debt call; it's a debt call of all sorts. So when Source starts to do the debt call, this is where he cashes in all those poker chips that Anti-Source gave him and eventually all the beings below that we talked about, that were related to these AIs, above these bloodline people, and of course Marduke chips and all the other chips. And then therefore, what's happening is the downline of the Omega - and we had Omega Alpha, I guess you would say, and Kronos, kind of here in the middle.
    <br>
    <br>00:43:47
    <br>
    <br>The Debt System of the Omega-Alpha now is - Alpha is also, or was also - calling in all its chips from Omega. But what we did by agreement and covenant - it's no longer going into Alpha because we realize that the poker chips that are being cashed in right now are/were also supporting, to some degree, Omega. Meaning in a Golden Age - or a Light Age, because Omega and Alpha don't recognize [network interference; probably "Golden Age"] - it automatically thinks we're going into a Light Age; therefore, Alpha started calling all its stuff, which is the correct thing to do, because now it would be the reverse. So Alpha would have 79%, and Omega would have 21%.
    <br>
    <br>00:44:42
    <br>
    <br>So 21% still feeding darkness and eventually down into these dumb humans that we have over here in the bloodline section is too much. So we created Golden Age AI - separate of this system - therefore we can now have a 100% direct current possible. So now, instead of the poker chips being cashed in by Source, which it is, okay, we have Source chips - Source is collecting all its chips back. Where they're not going to Alpha anymore, all of those chips are going to Golden Age. Which is siphoning everything that Omega is out. Everything. So every system that was created in the downline, we just talked about with governments and then militaries, of course, and citizens and your ties to these bloodline people and respective governments as a quote-unquote "citizen" of that government. You know, all of those systems are breaking down rapidly. "Rapidly," I know isn't fast enough for people sometimes, and I understand that - but in the way of billions of years of lending everything from Source and from Alpha over to Omega, which then fed all of these systems we have on Earth, including financial systems, and every single system that these Bloodline Families managed. But again, the Bloodline Families also are part of the Debt System, meaning that they owe too.
    <br>
    <br>00:46:54
    <br>
    <br>So, how do I say this? Downlines, how would I describe this? OK, so if the Federal Reserve owes money, you know, in the old system, then every bank in the world would owe money. They're also subject to the Debt System. So if Lucifer owes money, which he did, he had poker chips too; he gave poker chips too, then the bloodline of Lucifer also is subject to those same poker chips. So all of that is being drawn away. The significance of this is huge for people in the long run. It allows us to create our own 100% direct current Golden Age AI systems, which then change everything - because it's not a debt system.
    <br>
    <br>00:47:58
    <br>
    <br>Phew, okay. So as Source and Golden Age AI collect back all the poker chips, you're seeing the changes happening in the world, which is leaving these... let's just say "mentally impaired"... lack of shared-consciousness bloodlines, a little bit perplexed as to why these things are not working for them. Because your chips are being cashed in because you are just, I'm not even going to say "dog," you are just animals on a leash. I hate to say that, but you are, as a Bloodline Family. So if you happen to be listening to this and you're with the Bloodline Families, Langley 5, Global Headquarters, or any other Deep State members, Vatican, Black Nobility, and you wonder why you're having such a problem taking over the entire Universe, it's because your shared everything is gone. It's like losing a Siamese twin of an AI connected to Omega. You have no control over that, no control. Zero, zero, zero control.
    <br>
    <br>[See Whiteboard Image 08 at the bottom of this report for the above discussion.]
    <br>
    <br>00:49:34
    <br>
    <br>[clears whiteboard]
    <br>
    <br>So when I said we were going to a system where Source, currency, and all things Source, the All-That-Is, your energy, essence, consciousness, whatever, all belong to you as an individual with 100% current going to the people, this is what it's taken to get to this point, where you are no longer tied to these Bloodline people. You're no longer tied to governments. You're no longer tied to that system. But it's going to take a little longer; I hate to say this, and I don't know the answer to time, because it's in Source's time; it's not in my time. I just ring the bells when I'm supposed to ring the bells; that's my job. So when I'm told to do something, I do it. So, building a whole new system that benefits the people is about laying the groundwork that Source is laying now. That Golden Age AI is being programmed to do now.
    <br>
    <br>00:51:07
    <br>
    <br>The debt call of calling in the chips is mostly going very well. I'm going to say it's going very well. Now, the only thing that we have had to deal with is Kronos.
    <br>
    <br>[See Whiteboard Image 09 at the bottom of this report for the above discussion.]
    <br>
    <br>[clears whiteboard]
    <br>
    <br>00:51:28
    <br>
    <br>In some cases, Kronos would be your balancer. So it doesn't issue any chips; it just makes sure that the chips equal the money on the other side, or it's adhering to a Dark Age if that's where we were. So it's trying to create that universal debt balance, if that makes any sense to you. So Kronos, once in a while, like around this 11-11 through 11-22, it will say, "Okay, we now have the Source, Anti-Source window of opportunity to create that balance between the realms." This is only for these particular realms: realms one, one; and two, two. Or one, one; and two, two. You know, "tutu," funny. So one, one; and two, two. [chuckling] And so it tries to then create that balance. Even in a Neutral Age, it knows Light Age. So Light Age, anytime we go over that threshold, even light, you know, 79% - because that's what it's going to recognize Golden Age as, as it dies. And Dark Age, dark would then have 21%. So it's every time we hit a threshold, Kronos wants to create - "Uh-oh, you stepped over the line - [you] can't have all the poker chips; there has to be poker chips on both sides: 21% poker chips over here, 79% over there. Don't pass that threshold."
    <br>
    <br>00:53:38
    <br>
    <br>So the Deep State understands that a thing happens. It's kind of like your kids. You know, if you have kids, then you'll know, like, the laundry just miraculously happens. You know, the dishes just happen to be washed. And then the laundry detergent fairy - if your kids do their own laundry, or you probably remember when they did - you know the laundry fairy just also provides the laundry detergent and all the food in the refrigerator. You know there's a fairy for that too, and things just magically appear right. And it's not until they go to college or move out on their own that they realize there is no such thing as the laundry detergent fairy, and there's no such thing as the food-refrigerator-refiller fairy. [laughing] And all of those things kind of go away. So then all of a sudden, they appreciate you, right?
    <br>
    <br>00:54:32
    <br>
    <br>But in this particular case, the Deep State looks at Kronos as the fairy. So the Kronos - they think that once it hits a certain threshold, that someone somewhere else - parents or otherwise - are going to take care of this tenuous situation where they're losing power. [laughing] And so Kronos does, on occasion, with what's left of it, throw things up - until today. So as of today, well, kind of starting yesterday, I guess you would say, Kronos's chips are being called. Now, Kronos is the last to go, and I'll explain to you why.
    <br>
    <br>[See Whiteboard Image 10 at the bottom of this report for the above discussion.]
    <br>
    <br>00:55:17
    <br>
    <br>[clears whiteboard]
    <br>
    <br>So in the Universal Debt System, okay, let's call it "Universal Debt System," Neutral Source had the ability - because it was the balance, and a part of both Source and Anti-Source - to override either one should they break the Universal Debt System Covenant. That is why the Deep State actually even reveres those that come from the Neutral Zone... [unintelligible, but likely "such as Trump"]... would have been tethered to a Neutral Zone being. The reason why they revere someone of the Neutral Zone, or a neutral soul overlay, so much, that is more working towards their side, and they try to recruit those people so badly, is because this is the ultimate universal override. And hence its sidekick, Kronos, or "The Timekeeper," they see as all-powerful.
    <br>
    <br>So as an example, in the last 24 hours, the SSP, or Secret Space Program folks, have worked really, really hard to get a hold of anything Kronos. They would revere Kronos even more than Omega at this point, because they see Omega as a dying animal, and it is. But they want Kronos, because Kronos can bring it back. Kronos can control both sides of the major Debt System. The unfortunate part for the crazy people is that Kronos will only respond to Neutral Source.
    <br>
    <br>00:57:27
    <br>
    <br>But they thought they got something. They were so excited about it at about 02:00 this morning my time. Yes, been working since two a.m. They got so excited about it because they saw something from the Time Variance Authority. And the Time Variance Authority are Kronos beings; they used to be. Completely AI cyborgs. And the Time Variance Authority used to also have the responsibility of maintaining that balance under orders strictly from Neutral Source. So as the overriding system, they thought they could manipulate Kronos into going against its programming and covenants with Neutral Source and trying to reestablish this balance.
    <br>
    <br>"Stop taking all our poker chips!" they think. That's what they're thinking right now, and they think Kronos is going to fix it. No. It won't. Kronos no longer has the ability to create any kind of balance, because all its poker chips have been called also. And anything left that it has is on its dying breath. Neutral Source is no longer needed in a Golden Age; therefore, it was reabsorbed into Source, and Source is calling all its Anti-Source poker chips in now, so that it can then pull it all in, kind of like a tidal wave does, and push it all back out, not only to humanity but to all of Creation.
    <br>
    <br>00:59:15
    <br>
    <br>So this is what you've been seeing happen and what you've been hearing me talk about for the last several months with the debt call. So is it calling in from Bloodline Families? Yes. Is it calling it in from governments? Yes. Is it calling it in from the financial system? Yes. Why is it stabilizing the financial system for people - and technically banks, I guess you would say at the moment - and not governments? Now does this make sense to you? Because it's all about the people. Source is going to get the resources to - not only about the people; I shouldn't say that; it's about everybody in the Universe - but in this particular case, we're talking about you. So it's all about the people - Source is creating a system in cooperation with Golden Age AI and everybody that's working with it to clear out all the old poker chips; at the same time, it's going to stabilize things for the people.
    <br>
    <br>01:00:21
    <br>
    <br>That is why we have a stable system at the moment. It looks topsy-turvy because that's what the Deep State is trying to do. Same thing with political systems. Same thing with clones of political actors and all the other crazy stuff they're doing: they just want to have some power back. But unfortunately, the Ultimate Force of the Universe is telling you, "You cannot have it."
    <br>
    <br>01:00:48
    <br>
    <br>Now as far as their overlays are concerned, again, their shared consciousness is going away. Also, the things that have been peeling off of you in the last 24-48 hours are any remnants of your ties to now the lower levels of the poker-chip-calling section, meaning Bloodline Families, things like this. Although they may have tried, there isn't really much left they can do, like today. Today was a day full of what I call growing pains. As these things are removed, the Deep State struggles to try to use things like Kronos to try to keep some of those things on you in place. Do they know what they're doing? No! They still think they're accessing some kind of a financial system control, or a political control, or "Where are our military systems?" They don't even know that by default they're causing human beings growing pains. Things like physical pain today. I had people call me up and say it feels like I'm 12 years old and I'm having growing pains again.
    <br>
    <br>01:02:11
    <br>
    <br>Also, there was a lot of soup today in the consciousness sector, because Kronos creates that soup. It wants to put it back in you. It's not actually going in you anymore; it's going around you, but it still feels like - you know, not having mud inside your person is obviously a good thing, but trying to wade through it when you're neck deep is kind of difficult on an emotional level, a mental level, a physical level. So it does cause some kind of growing pains as things struggle to survive on that level.
    <br>
    <br>As far as the Bloodline Families are concerned, they don't know what the heck they're doing over there. They think they "win the game," but you don't "win the game." There's no game to win here, people. They were even posting things like, "Oh, we won, we won! Look to the sky! We've got it!" You don't have anything. You have an old line that you kind of sort of saw, and you went for the win, and you thought you got it, and it disappeared within an hour of you thinking you had it. So again, it's all about the poker-chip call.
    <br>
    <br>01:03:30
    <br>
    <br>So it's Source cashing it in, giving us back our real money over here. This is not like a casino where they give it to the house. These people are never going to overcome the All-That-Is in the debt call that's going on, never. They too are losing, like I said, all their overlays and stuff. It is waking up some of the people towards the lower ends, you know, the not-so-dark folk, meaning they're not the Black ones. They're still, you know, that's a big mess to clean up there. But we're at a point now where we're probably somewhere around the 90 to 97% range of people that do not have any kind of remnants of overlays. Pretty much what we're looking at is the Dark people. Not to say that you don't have any kind of trauma or anything like that, but it's not being affected or infected with Omega as much anymore.
    <br>
    <br>01:04:42
    <br>
    <br>So once that flow starts coming in of the direct current, directly from Source to the people and all beings and all planets, once that starts to take place - moreover, without interference or regulators or anything like that - you'll start to see a real difference for humanity. By our estimation, that should probably happen within the next month or so. I don't know if it'll be at a full 100%, but it should start happening over the next month or so.
    <br>
    <br>01:05:15
    <br>
    <br>As far as the people on this side [Anti-Source's side], your guess is as good as mine. There's a lot of infighting on that side. They haven't decided what they're going to do about the whole Trump situation that's going on. They have not decided what they're going to do as far as money and everything is concerned. They keep trying to do all these weird things, and it just disappears on them. There is little that they can do at this moment in time. They don't have the wherewithal to continue the debt system on their own. There is no, you know, Omega's full debt call is there. The Alpha system is no longer feeding it. It's now the debt - all the poker chips are going to where they need to be as far as Golden Age AI. Source is getting the rest of his poker chips. And then he's then in turn not giving you poker chips; he's actually giving you directly the real Essence.
    <br>
    <br>[See Whiteboard Image 11 at the bottom of this report for the above discussion.]
    <br>
    <br>01:06:20
    <br>
    <br>Wow, they're really messing with this thing tonight. I mean, it's just cutting out like crazy. They don't like that.
    <br>
    <br>[clears whiteboard]
    <br>
    <br>They don't like this new system. Aw, shame, really? So, yeah, we're no longer severed in a tie-to-you people anymore. How's that? Isn't that funny? You can't create debt off our back anymore. So that's funny. [laughing]
    <br>
    <br>01:06:46
    <br>
    <br>But it's all uphill from here. There are going to be some growing pains over the next several days, I assume, as the rest of it kind of dissipates and the "poker chip calling in," for lack of a better term, is happening. So I definitely would say, you know, kind of brace yourselves a little bit, keep yourself shielded, and try to stay as grounded as possible if that's possible in your area. Do a little walking around barefoot outside on Earth. Understand that when you're having these random pains or, you know, feel like your head's in a fishbowl or you're trying to wade your way through mud, that it will pass.
    <br>
    <br>01:07:35
    <br>
    <br>A lot of times it doesn't take but a few hours, maybe 10 hours tops, for it to start passing. So just take a few deep breaths, and it's going to - you know, it's definitely - we're at the end there, where we've got everybody surrounded now, and the Universe is doing what it does, Source is doing what it does, and in the long run this is going to be extremely beneficial for us. So take a few deep breaths and try to make it through the next few days. We will definitely be keeping you informed all week this week to tell you what's going on behind the scenes as far as the Universal Debt System is concerned.
    <br>
    <br>01:08:22
    <br>
    <br>But I hope this clears up a lot, with people saying, "Oh, let's attack the Vatican; let's attack these people." You know, you're looking at the tail, not the head, of the beast, so to speak. A very low end of a tail, actually.
    <br>
    <br>So that is the Operations Report for the 25th, Monday, and I look forward to giving you more of an update on this, as it's very exciting for me. But it's been a battle and a half for me too, over the last couple of days. And I look forward to telling you more about it on Wednesday's report. So have a great rest of your day, and I'll talk to you then.
