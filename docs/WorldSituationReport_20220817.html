        <h4 style="text-align: center;"> From the Office of the Guardian </h4>
        <br>
        <strong>
        <br>Sunny: Wow, isn't that a lovely little cartoon? Hi, Kim.
        </strong>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:01:52</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Hi, how are you?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:01:54</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: I'm good. I know you've been working hard. So what's the latest? What's going on? (Kim: Am I echoing?) Not in my ear. I'm good in mine.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:02:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Just double-checking. Mike's got everything going on over here, so I just want to double-check. But what isn't going on right now? I am telling you it has been a crazy week. [Pause.] Sorry, I thought that you were gonna say something.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:02:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: So, what's going on?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:02:29</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: All right, well let's talk about the meetings. So I told you that there were meetings going on down the street and we would see if they wanted to meet, right? (Sunny: Right.) And that Mr. Puss in Boots [Juan O'Savin], right? Isn't that a child's book? (Sunny: I think it was in some animations, some cartoons.) Yeah, is also down the street still. He was preparing to leave on, I think it was Monday. And he didn't end up leaving. He's staying here, pleading to the locals, actually wasting their time, is more like it. While his little operation continues.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:03:09</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So we caught him red-handed. We've caught him and several others - this in the last 24, 48 hours - red-handed with exactly what they were up to. Hence the information that's in the news, right?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:03:22</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: Right.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:03:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So there's been a lot of meetings going on and a lot of talk about something expiring on the 20th, and we'll see what happens. A lot of the militaries are kind of waiting to see what's going to go on. But this all goes back to a very old, old agreement, which happened about nine years after the building of Solomon's Second Temple. I know this sounds crazy to a lot of people that are watching me for the first time - and are definitely watching for the first time because of all the information that's been flying around - and this is the bottom line right here - why. And then I'll go into all the details of, you know, everything else that's going on, why the meetings are happening, why all this stuff is going, you know, the world is going crazy, the country's going crazy, the affidavits, the Kushner talk, all this stuff all ties in together.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:04:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Well, nine years after building the temple, he formed, I guess you would say, an agreement in the Hall of Records called Solomon's Curse or Solomon's Bloodline Curse and this began the rule of or the creation of what you know as the Dragon Families or the Order. This is how the Rothschilds' claim to fame came to be, right? You know, they pretend to be Jewish - but they're not Jewish in any way. They are predominantly Satanists or Luciferians, right? Solomon partnered up with the demons, didn't he? And as the Rothschild family and the Li family and the Russian families, the Red Dragons and all the different colors - and there's a reason for that too - all the different colors came to be. Well, that agreement was due to expire on the 20th.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:05:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: However, we're a little smarter than that now, aren't we? Because what has been happening over the last couple of days, I have been getting phone calls from tons of people that work with the Chinese elders and the Asian elders and the Philippine elders and the Russian elders and the White Dragon elders and all of this stuff saying, "It's time for us to work together. It's time for us to formulate a new agreement." And I'm sitting here going, you know, you can clock with an egg timer how long it's going to take to get this done. But as an interesting and zippy, exciting twist, as part of this...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:05:49</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Okay, so we talked about them in the news on Monday, finding the terminal in which I communicated with Trump on, and then them giving me a call, right? So I confirmed that I had provided monetary support to the United States, not to the Families. Okay? Never to the Families. Well, this is actually rather funny. So we know that there's a person, an agency guy most likely, who is playing the role of Trump, who is not fully read in. We can call him "Mushroom Trump," okay? Because Kushner and O'Savin would definitely, definitely have not read him in on everything that's happening. Okay?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:06:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So he was questioned the other day, I think it was on Sunday, Saturday or Sunday of last week, about his communications with me on the terminal. So they had all the documents printed out and he goes, "I don't know what you're talking about." Well, of course, he doesn't because that's not Trump. And well, you know, he could always say "I'm pleading the fifth," but that's actually not true - he really sincerely didn't know. And he said, "Well, this is your signature, sir. These were all filed - did you not sign this?" "Oh, I don't remember signing any of that." Well, he was pretty embarrassed, let's just say. But it gave Kushner and the Families the idea that, "Hey, this is where the money came from! We will sign a new agreement with her."
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:07:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: And then it got deeper. His little handler over there in China and the rest of the Rothschildian friends of his all got together and they hired a lawyer to draft an agreement with all the curses and the Jewish Gematria and the blah blah blah in it so that I wouldn't notice that it was actually a renewal of the Solomon's Bloodline Agreement. So that contract is due to get to me some way, somehow, by tomorrow.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:08:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Now, why by tomorrow? Well, that's the fastest the attorney could draw it up and you need all the, I don't know, Kabbalists, I guess you would say, the Jewish people to come in and work their magic thingy on the thing, right? And the whole deal. Or black magic, I should say. So, tomorrow. Well, coincidentally, isn't it funny that that hearing is tomorrow for the affidavit release? Well, I'll tell you why.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:08:37</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So Juan O'Savin has been running around with trillions of dollars in tear sheets that he received from Leo Wanta. If you don't know who Leo Wanta is, you can look him up. He talks on the internet all the time about how he single-handedly crashed the USSR - which never happened - and that he took the money for the American people, trillions of dollars, and they were in an account in Citibank and blah, blah, blah. Well, they were never in Citibank, first of all - they were an off-ledger account which was in... the Alpha System! Mine, right? And so they did transfer money in the 90s and what not out of this and he had all this proof that they had transferred money, but no one bothered to check the current status of it - until Sunday night. And this, my friends, is when we started unraveling the big scam-o-rama that's going on on the American people and American patriots. Okay?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:09:39</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So, Jared checked it. Now remember: the big payouts were gonna happen on Monday, right? Everybody's gonna make money. And all the agency people are getting paid, and blah blah blah, the Chinese elders in Reno, and it's all happening, right?
        <br>
        <br>Well, that money's not there. Hasn't been there since 2019. And those notifications actually went out as such. So, he actually found out from - he sent some agency people into Citibank to see if the money is real, they found out it's not there. They don't know where it went; the access code of Wanta's doesn't work anymore, and he realized, "Uh-oh, I'm in trouble."
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:10:27</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So now what happens? He immediately picks up the phone around, I would say, Mountain Time - it was sometime around 05:47, I think it was, something like that. He picked up the phone and he said, "This money isn't real - you're in deep... Fix it." And hangs up the phone.
        <br>
        <br>So, the beloved (not by me, but maybe by others) Juan O'Savin immediately started to rapidly evacuate, you know, his person. Went into a full-on panic. What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? He had a flight to go out, I think it was at 10 o'clock in the morning-ish or something like that, my time. He was planning on leaving. He decided not to leave. Noon was the time everybody thought they were getting paid. And bleep has hit the proverbial fan.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:11:27</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So, true to form, Kushner keeps calling him and calling him and calling him, and he consulted with some other friends of his, namely, some Israeli generals who are also loyal to the Dragon Families and the Rothschilds and he's been working with them ever since. He knew he wasn't going to get out of here. He had been having way too many conversations with the locals, you know, arrogant conversations. Promising them, even them himself that he was going to be dispersing this money to all of them and they were going to be best buddies. And all to delay a meeting with me. So this banter about him having loose lips and talking about all the things he's done, asking for immunity, asking for immunity for past, present, and future - which is a new one, right? I want immunity for all the things I'm going to do! Who does that? No one gets that. That's not a thing.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:12:28</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: But he thought he had them. So, turns out that that money's not real - but the Chinese elders are gonna come in and do it - so I'm your in-man, I'm your in; I'm your friend. You know, you give me global immunity and I'll cut you in on the deal. Right? And these are the people from Cheyenne that have come and gone. I mean there's people from everywhere having these conversations just down the street from me. All to delay having a conversation with me directly.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:13:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Based on what? Kushy Kush [Kushner]. That's why. Because the contract won't be ready till tomorrow. So he was told to buy time, until at least Thursday, till they could get the contract in hand. Hide Kim, you know, in the pocket - pretend that she doesn't exist. And then tell everybody that lives here that, "Oh, my God, the money came."
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:13:30</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So he said he was going to be my new handler. He spent time convincing everyone here that I would accept such a thing, but it wouldn't happen until Thursday. So he's been buying time. He's since realized, because everybody's listening to me, on here and otherwise on my phone, that there's not a chance in... of me doing such a thing. Okay?
        <br>
        <br>I personally think - when I show you the rest of the mess here in just a minute - that the man is an idiot. And he is a power-hungry, egotistical idiot who is right on the brink (as we speak) of starting a civil war in the United States. He actually should be branded a terrorist.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:14:21</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So to answer a couple of quick questions, does Kushner work for the Order? The answer to the question is absolutely. He has been a member of the Khazarian side of the Order, though - the Jewish side, I guess you would say, the non-Jewish Jewish people - and he had very close ties to the Black Chabad, which you just mentioned in the news. The Black Chabad would be considered the Coven that would be over the Order, or one of them anyway. So the Order all works together. The Asian side, the Golden Dragon, the White Dragon, the Blue Dragon, you know, and so on and so forth - the Green Dragons, and there's nine of them. And there's a reason why there's nine and I'll explain that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:15:10</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: But to keep with the line of the current state of the Union and state of affairs, yeah, they know. Juan O'Savin absolutely with 100 percent certainty, no question - based on his phone records over the last 60 to 90 days, including but not limited to his phone being in the room while having conversations with Kushner and the rest of the Trumps - that he intends on participating in the Chinese takeover of the United States. That is a fact. Now he feels it's going to be turbulent for a little while - that's our civil war that he's orchestrating along with Kushner. Kushner has also threatened the other siblings of Trump in the last couple of days.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:16:01</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So, worse. Okay, it's already happening. So I'll take you back to Sunday night for a second, and I'm sorry for skipping around - there's so much information in this report, you're probably going to have to listen to it a couple of times. But it's important that I tell you the reason why, what's happening, and why I'm asking you to reach out to the militias and the patriots in this country. Because I'm not sure if we can stop this event before it happens.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:16:30</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So right after Kushner called Juan O'Savin on Sunday night he started indirectly making phone calls sporadically from multiple different phones within the area that he was in (not just his), ordering people to threaten members of Congress. Comes out with a statement on Monday, stating what? "It's going to get bad here if you don't turn down the heat." What did he mean by that? Now you know.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:17:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So for the last 48 hours, Homeland Security, other agencies, Secret Service has been running around the whole country fending off death threats coming to members of Congress, the Supreme Court, to the FBI, to agencies and whatnot. And it's all coming from a single location. He went in panic mode. See, he too promised Mrs. Li - who is not actually a Li by the way - he too promised Mrs. Li that he would achieve getting the money.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:17:46</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Now what does that mean to us? Okay, I'm going to back it up just for a second at this spot. Why is the money so important to the Rothschildian organization known as the Illuminati? In 2013, I had a conversation with one of Rothschild's people, let's just say, and I was told explicitly - and I will repeat because I've told you this before - that, "We are going to crash the United States and buy it back for pennies on the dollar." No money, no crash. No money, no crash.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:18:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So what's really happening here? The Wanta money didn't come through. Kushner's panicking. "I'm about to crash the United States," he's saying to himself, right? Along with my friend, Juanny, right? And now the Wanta money didn't work out. This contract with Kim's not going to work out - she's not going to support this. Of course I'm not going to support this. You have lost your ever-loving mind, right? And in your mind you have until Saturday night at midnight GMT time to get her to re-up the deal.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:18:57</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Or the whole Rothschildian Order falls away. Now why would anybody in their right mind want to do that? I wouldn't. Anybody here like those people? Raise your hand, send me a private message saying, "Please save the Rothschilds." And I'll consider it. You better have a good explanation as to why. Should we save Juan O'Savin? Juan-O savin' nothing. Juan O'Savin crashin' the country. He be crashin'. And burning.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:19:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So now that there's no money coming from that, the man is in a total panic. And when people with power are panicked bad things happen. He warned you they were going to, right? That's all his social media campaign. It's already written in his bio that he runs all the social media, right? He runs all the media, all the narrative for the Trump team, has since the beginning. It's in writing all over the internet. Don't take my word for it or UNN's word for it. Go look it up for yourself. True to form, he's still running that narrative.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:20:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: What's the endgame? That's the most important thing, right? Number 1, we expired the agreement early - it just expired this morning. We have replaced it with the People of the World's reign. The meek shall inherit the earth, remember that one? And it's already happening.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:20:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So, coming after me and continuously sending crazy Asian people to this town, or sending the Jewish mafia in New York after us, or trying to convince Tom, or any other of these people that keep calling me that have connections to you to re-sign an agreement - I've already opted out. And I've replaced your agreement with "your reign has ended" as of this morning. And the people's reign has begun. We are now the reigning party - the "People's Party," let's call us, right? This whole show that is happening right now with Eric Trump doing interview after interview after interview is all being put forward by Juan O'Savin and Kushner.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:21:20</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Are they upset about the Mar-a-Lago raid? Sure they are. Do they know that their own people ordered it? I don't know. There might be someone else's name on there. There might be the FBI on there. There might be the Pentagon on there. But they did nothing to stop it and they could have. They knew they were going to use it as a media tool to gather the remaining patriots that would get them up to 80% support. Why? Because if they had gotten the money, we will have erupted like, I don't know, you could clock it with an egg timer, on Thursday, tomorrow.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:22:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So if you know patriots, if you know the militia, please reach out to them, give them a copy of this report. Understand: this has nothing to do with the former president. This has nothing to do with your support for the former president. This has to do with two people conspiring to be the most powerful people in America, if not the entire world. Now Juanito also thinks he's going to be appointed Pindar out of this whole gigio. Be a member of our Families. It's all about the Bloodline, he's saying, right?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:22:40</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: That's also the reason why Charlie Ward fell flat on his face. Did you see the picture of Charlie Ward and Eric? This is the narrative here, guys. Charlie Ward also said that he's [Juan O'Savin is] JFK Jr. Thinks he's going to be vice president. Told him he's going to be vice president. Go along with the thing - play the game, fellow spook of mine.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:23:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Yep. So with this whole affidavit hearing, it was going to end badly right after I signed a contract that I would never sign in 1 million years anyway. And it's too late now, regardless. So they just need to hang it up. But irrespective of all of that, that would have erupted the country into a civil war, depending on what the affidavit actually says. Now it can say anything, it doesn't mean that's what it said yesterday. You understand?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:23:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So, once the country erupted into a civil war, then there would of course be a financial crash, right? They're having a really tough time with this whole World War III scenario, you know, the total crash of everything. Russians aren't really playing their job - they don't want to participate in nuclear war. Although General Raymond of the Space Force has been running around working plans for what he calls a "nuclear trifecta." That would be a nuclear war with the U.S., Iran and Russia. Russia has adamantly said they don't want to have a nuclear war; they don't want to get involved in that. We played your game, you know, the old KGB general is saying, "We played your game with the Ukraine, and we're not willing to take it that far." So the loyalty to the Dragons and the Order of the Dragons is becoming a very serious problem for Americans.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:24:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So, do you have a mole in the Trump camp? Oh my God, you've got more than one. And he's the one that kept this show going. So, as another warning I'm going to tell you, we have absolute proof and evidence of the fact that your donations that have been going to the Trump camp recently - you know, my home's been raided, donate - are being utilized by Kushner and Juan O'Savin to pay people off, to run operations, and it's keeping them going. In a short span of time, public information states 250 million dollars were collected in support for the campaign by Kushner. Those are small donations. Those are not the big campaign donors, you know. Those are the little guys. That's you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:25:35</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: How much do you think they've collected in the last two years? Almost two full years since he's been out of the White House. A lot. A ridiculous amount. So why is the guy driving around in alleged Bentleys and talking about this car and that car? And you see all his antique cars and his little videos and his $800 boots and the whole deal dealio. You paid for it, guys. Patriots, you paid for it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:26:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Now, I don't really care about most alt-media people. Like, not that I don't care - of course I care - but I don't look at people this way. He absolutely has been issued a level 68 clearance by DARPA. Kushner also has a very high clearance. Still maintains that clearance to this day. And him and his Jewish buddies are ready to do the Rothschild plan of transference of power to China. So the Civil War, financial crash. The money would be given to the Chinese side of the Family, and then they would buy up the United States for pennies on the dollar - and completely control the United States. The only difference is that, is it the ones in London that are doing it? And the white guys? Or is it the Chinese guys? Or does it really matter? But in reality, it's not going to be as quiet and peaceful of a transition as Juan, in his brain, thinks.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:27:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Is he still running the operation right in front of your face, local people? The answer to the question is, yes, he is. He's having communications with an Israeli general. All of this is happening right in front of your face. Now, I'm going to tie this into further things, because questions were asked to me, like, "Why do they do this Gematria thing?" This is coming from people that are looking up these documents in the National Archives, right? "Why do they do this mysticism thing and all of this stuff, and what is it all about?"
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:27:49</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Well, there's the Zohar, right? And then you have a whole other side of things. Now the Line of Solomon chose the demons. Now they would often conjure demons to do the things I'm about to tell you. And it's important for you to also understand why everything's been so wonky, and why they've had so much control of the world. And why that also is coming to an end.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:28:20</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Now, the Dragon Families pick colors. Do you ever wonder why they pick colors? You know, varying shades of the rainbow. And what is a rainbow? Fractionated light. So if you were to shine light, pure white light, through a prism or a tetrahedron, you would get those colors coming out the other side, separated, right? Now what did they put in the middle?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:28:52</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So if you've been doing this long enough, you've heard about, for example, your chakras, right? You know that you have nine chakras. Some people say seven, but you have nine. And the different lights all represent different things, right? And they want you to meditate on certain chakras to have certain effects on your person. It doesn't really work that way.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:29:22</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So we're going to talk today, I know we just went from crazy crazy, so at this moment in time - just to end that part of the broadcast before I get into this one here - at this moment in time, Kushner is sequestered while they are reviewing all the phone records and everything and they're doing that as I'm talking to you. Local people have also gotten Juan's records. That river that he's on is actually the one that is here in Durango, Colorado. It's called the Animas River. When he's paddling along, you know, on his little thing there. I know that river. Been on that river, been in that river, been around that river, walked the whole river. Maybe not the whole one, but you know at least probably a solid 10 miles of it. So I'm very familiar with every twist, turn, tree, rock, and whatnot on the thing, so I know exactly where the bridge is, and the whole thing.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:30:18</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So to wrap that up, what are they going to do now? I don't know. As for the meetings from the higher-up people that went on for hours and hours and hours yesterday - they just wanted to wait it out to the 20th. Well, congratulations folks, you can check your National Archives, you no longer have to wait. It's over. It's already over. So no contracts from those people. She can write operations till the cows come home, but there's no money coming that direction. There's no power. And this, what I'm about to tell you, is waning rapidly even more so.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:30:54</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So we played that little video about the gold and, you know, coming out of the blood, right? There's a reason for that. I know, Sunny. Am I blowing your mind yet?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:31:06</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: There's a lot. There's a lot going on. I feel like I should be taking notes.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:31:09</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: There's a lot going on, and I'm sorry. You know, like I said, you might have to play this a few times. I don't want to keep you forever, so I'm just trying to give you a little bit of information. But this is actually the good part for us. What does this mean?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:31:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: All right. We never had - until several thousand years ago - chakras. We had one. Pure white light. There wasn't these types of planes of existence. Although you could travel further into the Light, or further out of the Light, and each one does a different thing.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:31:56</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So let's talk about the planes of existence as they exist at the moment, and how the Families interfered using mysticism and black magic. All right, so you're a person, and you have the lowest level of your person is called the Supranal Plane. And on the Supranal Plane, this is your spiritual self. So this is where you make that connection with Source. Okay? This is your religions where those live and those types of things. Okay? But you also had something there which was placed with the opposite.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:32:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So, you had the Incarnate. Okay? So, on the Incarnate Level, this is about concerns of the flesh. You know, sex; things like that, right? Purely focused on the physical self. You know, food, the minimum needs on the bottom of Maslow's triangle, right? So then you have the Optimal Level [the Optimal Plane]. And on the opposite side of the Optimal Level you have Alienation.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:33:29</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Okay, so the Optimal Level is more about the realization that you're connected to something greater than yourself. You are a part of the whole. You have an effect on your family with everything you do and every decision you make. Your friends, those around you. Wow, you know, maybe I'm connected to the trees and I'm connected to nature, and everything I do has an impact on everything else. You know, do I just throw my trash in the street? Do I just park my car on my neighbor's lawn? You're realizing, well, you know, everything I do has an effect on other people. Maybe not on a consciousness level, but on a somewhat subconscious or your conscious, I guess, would apply here.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:34:22</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Okay. On the opposite side of that you would have Alienation. Ostracizing people. You're the wrong color. This is where your labels come in. You're the wrong color, you're a member of the wrong political party, you are not liked by your neighbors, you're not liked by your schoolmates, you're being alienated from society because you don't have an iPhone, or you don't have the right clothes or you're not keeping up with the Joneses or you have the wrong... I don't know, you name it, right? You're alienated. The alienation is a program. Incarnation is a program - we already learned that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:35:06</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Okay, so above that we have the Physical Level [the Physical Plane]. This is what everyone calls the 3D world, right? This is the place where we exist. This is about your physical self, your meat suit, your vessel. This is about your health, your wellness. Everything that you put into your mouth. Different Bible verses that come to mind is like Proverbs 3:7-8 right? This is about you taking care of your vessel and your impact on the physical world.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:35:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: On the opposite side of that [the Physical Plane], you have Outcast. This is where disease lives. This is where dis-ease lives. This is where social and mental issues come into play. This is where people start to feel alienated. This is where rejection comes in, right?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:36:12</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Now, Physical Plane, okay. So now we have the Astral Plane. And when people talk about the Astral Plane, they talk about traveling into the astral, right? They talk about the fact that you need to keep your silver cord in place that connects you (it's interesting that it's silver), that connects you - your physical self - and your soul as it travels around the astral, right?
        <br>
        <br>But the Astral Realm really just represents one thing. When you're talking about the planes of existence that exist within your person, it really refers to your non-physical self. And all the things that your non-physical self can do, with or without your physical self. Important to understand that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:37:08</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Okay, on the opposite side of this you have - this is what the non-educated people view as like, heaven, right? Like, "Wow, I'm in my soul and all this light all these things are happening." You of course had the opposite in there too, and we call this Salvation. Now that might not make any sense to you, but this is where your Savior Program lives. You know, this is where you're damned for your alleged sins, and dogma comes into play. Things that really don't apply. But you keep asking another human being to save you, or "salvation." So these are your savior programs. And remember, everybody was in charge of something different in this Order of the Families at one point in time.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:37:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Okay, so the next one is the Causal Plane. You can also refer to this as the place where the ripple effect happens. Okay, let's see. So opposite of that, we would have Solitude, or Service to Self.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:38:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So, the Causal Plane is where your non-physical self starts to realize or realizes that there's a ripple effect. So if you were to create something in the Causal Plane, it will have a ripple effect throughout all the planes of existence - both in your person - positively or negatively. You realize that although there's a balance, service to yourself exclusively doesn't really work. It doesn't work for your children, your grandchildren, you know, your spouse or in relationships or friendships, but there is a balance there. You know, there is a certain amount of self-care required. Time spent with Source; time spent with your whole self. And then there's time to share with everyone else.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:39:26</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: But you also realize that every step you take, every time you make a move - doing anything - it has a ripple effect on all those around you, and all nature around you. If your energy is bad, as an example, and you try to grow a garden, your plants will not grow. I mean, it's pure and simple. Your children start crying more. They start being upset. When you're upset or nervous or anxious, your animals do the same thing, right? So that's the Causal Plane.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:40:01</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Okay, so the opposite of that is Solitude. Having no recognition whatsoever that what you are doing has an effect on anyone or anything other than yourself. Right? Service to self. And there's a reason. We'll go through it and I'll explain to you kind of how this worked.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:40:21</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Okay, so above that you had Emotional. We talk a lot about how your emotional self affects your physical self, right? The Emotional Plane is your collective consciousness, if you will, realizing that your thoughts, feelings, and so on and so forth affect others. On this side of it, it would be where love is, your heart center as they talk about it. Your caring for one another comes from this plane, and self-care as well.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:41:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Okay, on the opposite side of the Emotional Plane, we have Investure. So what does "investure" mean? Investure would mean a sense of superiority. This would be where your indoctrination comes in. Those people are royal and I am not; I am less than. Now, anytime we feel "less than," that affects our emotional self now, doesn't it? The Elite, so to speak. The power, the struggle. People feeling like they're better than someone else, simply because they bear a title of some sort or another.
        <br>
        <br>That's where that comes in, and this is very important that we did this today - on the expiration of that agreement - which is why I'm explaining this to you. And it's for these reasons.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:42:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Then we have the Mental Plane. Okay, and the Mental Plane obviously is very simple. Oh, sorry, a mistake. We have the Etherical Plane first. The Etherical Plane is the ability to recognize the fact that we are all made up of those particles of Light. People talk about the - and I always say this word wrong - Akashic Records, or whatever they call them. This is the place where those exist. We are all basically a network computer tied to each other. That energy can be clean, it can be light, it can be a mixture of both. We strive for being clean and pure, right? At least on our side of things. Can't say the same for some of these other folks we just talked about. But that's your Etherical Plane.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:43:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: The opposite on the Etherical Plane would be where Fear is. Or, the memories. So sometimes we have, we have memories, right? Obviously, we have memories of this life; we have memories of other lives, thanks to these people recycling us, right? Like we're plastic bottles. And because of that, your conscious mind and your subconscious mind lives here. It doesn't live on the Mental Plane like you might think.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:43:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So in order for you to reach a pure state, you have to have no fear. Now fear comes in many ways, like, say you have a fear of heights. Well, in a former life you might have died because someone pushed you off a cliff, and you don't even know why you're afraid of heights (or spiders or snakes or whatever it is your fear is), right? But those subconscious memories remain.
        <br>
        <br>So, during the incarnation process, they made sure that all our fears stayed, but all our actual memories left, or all the other memories, except for fear. And our fears continue on lifetime after lifetime after lifetime. So interesting.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:44:27</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Okay, so now we have the Mental Plane. And opposite of the Mental Plane, we have your Shadow Self. All right. So the Mental Plane is where we make conscious decisions. Do we continue on through the planes of existence? Am I worthy to go to Source? Am I worthy to have the conversation there and then come all the way back? Am I worthy to exist in the higher plane? Is my non-physical self ready for the journey? Well, the Shadow side of yourself wants to prevent you from doing that. Your Shadow side is your "shadow work," allegedly, that people have to do, right? "Have you done your shadow work," everybody talks about. Well this is the reason why this exists.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:45:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So the highest plane is the Soul Plane. The Soul Plane is a place where time does not exist. (I'm going off my thing here.) And the opposite of that is the Nothing. So when you're in the Soul Plane you're in physical pure Source. That's where the souls live, right?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:45:47</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Now interesting because I'm going to show you how this works. Energetically speaking, energy flows in a very different way. So until this transition took place, it would go like this until you went through all the planes. So have you ever been like trying to travel on the Etherical Plane and you run into a demon or you're trying to connect to Source and the Soul Plane and you feel like you ended up in Nothing, like, there's nothing. And it makes you afraid to go on, you know. Well, this is why.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:46:26</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Now, when you think about chakras, they all have different colors, right? Red, blue, yellow, green, pink. Well, fractionated light was created by the spaces in between and these other layers that did not exist. Now why did they have, why did all of the, I don't know what you want to call it, the Dragon Families have different colors? Well each one managed a different plane of existence - a different part of the spaces in between, I should say - to ensure that you never become a whole person. Unless you were fearless enough to get through all the blocks that they put in place. Now if you look at the socio-humanitarian, I would say, programs that are run on all of us, you'll see that they contain all of these things.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:47:21</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: These are successful programs, Divide and Conquer, Alienate, make you feel like you're an outcast, make you feel like you have to go see the guy in the pointy hat to reach God, right? And all of these things don't have to happen. If you do something in the Book, right - the Bible or whatever it is - or the 613 original commandments (which are asinine), then you can't go to heaven. You can't go to any of these places. And you will have convinced yourself that, "Well, I sinned, so now I can't go. I have no hope of going here anyway." And these were your connections also to the Lower Astral.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:47:59</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So did we always have chakras like they show? No, but all of those lights are contained within pure white light anyway. It's just white light fractionated. So we do use different colors for healing. We use different colors, you know, if we're in love or we're sending someone love, it might be that magenta pink color. We might be using light blue for healing one another. And they all have a purpose. Changing that white light to be more focused on one hue or another - transmuting - is very different than fractionation.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:48:40</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: And so this agreement that is expiring today along with all the other ones that I had posted on the general chat is really, really important for you to understand. Because these [Incarnate, Alienation, Outcast, Salvation, Solitude, Investure, Memories, Fear] are now all going away. So the reign over your person no longer exists. We don't have Investure anymore; we don't have all of these things anymore.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:49:06</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: And if you have them within yourself, start taking a look at these things because within the next couple of days, all of this will dissipate and this will become one again. Meaning, yes, you're still going to have colors within the light, sure, but you're going to be your whole self. Again, without interruption from anyone else, ethically or otherwise. So until, I would say, last week, the Etherical Plane was what you would call silver in color. Silver in color on the Etherical Plane would mean a mixture of Dark and Light. So that's where you would have had interference, you know, from the darkness. And they would have controlled that plane as part of the reincarnation program. So you would go from you'd probably make it all the way up to close to the Etherical Plane and you would come right back down into the Incarnation, and we'd start all over again, right?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:50:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So they knew this, and this is part of their black, the black side. Now I have no problem with Jewish people whatsoever - real ones - but I do have a problem with the ones that use the spell books to contact Lucifer and work in a Dark essence type way. The ones that really practice "Enlightenment," so to speak, know that if you're using Source energy or God energy you have to adhere to Natural Law or there's very very bad consequences. Well, these people were okay with that. There's no rules, allegedly, on the Dark Side for doing some of the things that we would get in trouble for. So as these planes merge, and it should only be maybe another couple of days or so before everything is fully synced up, you might be experiencing old emotions coming to the surface, having dreams of old things - very, very old things in some cases - as we become a one whole person again.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:51:18</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So is there going to be an intervention by the Satanists, right, the Khazarians - Asian or otherwise - into the United States? You know, I'm hoping by putting this information out today that that will not be the case. I'm hoping that the agencies figure out who these people that I'm talking about really, really are and make decisions from there. If they don't make the decisions, we'll make the decisions. And the Enforcer is ready to make those decisions immediately.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:51:59</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Are we going back to the reign of the Elites? No. The programs are ending, they're dissolving. You can check the archives. We also sent them out to every agency and every military in the world. So this lady can bark out whatever she wants to bark out. She's actually part of the Black Widow program. You saw the movie Black Widow talk about Russian agents, you know, training women, female agents. She is the Asian, Chinese version of that. She is not a Li, she was never born a Li - it was her husband. She was, like I said, you marry into the Families, don't you? Why, do you think that's just for the Americans? Absolutely not! That's for the Asians, that's for everyone, they all do it right? You know it's all about control, it's one way to rule the world.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:52:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So yeah, that's what's been going on. So we'll see what happens from here on out. We are prepared to act either way. We are hoping you understand as patriots. I know you're angry. I know you're angry about what's happening with the Trump family. I know you're angry about the January 6th crap and the lawsuit crap and all of that crap. Were they all aware of it? The answer to the question is: I don't know about the kids; I know Kushner was. I know Juan O'Savin actually was conducting it - he trained under Chaney in the Bush family, just so you know. He was also a lower-end operative during the 9/11 situation. So he thought he could repeat it over there in the Capitol building. So yeah, much like Cheney and Bush, they were obviously aware of the 9/11 situation before it actually happened. Talked about that. And so were these people.
        <br>

        <br>Kim: They were shocked actually when their little remote buttons didn't work. The cathedral situation was also prevented - the buttons didn't work. There was a lot of different things that they've tried to do towards the end there to gather more patriots to make more donations to continue on.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:54:20</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: But - I will repeat for those of you that haven't heard this before - Trump absolutely won the election, that's a fact. Was there voter fraud? Absolutely. Was he involved in it? Absolutely. He chose to leave office. He wanted to leave office because he thought he was going to gain a higher position within the Order. He knew about COVID ahead of time - years ahead of time. He knew that this was going to happen, or begin at least, during his presidency.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:54:56</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: But the majority of horrible things done to Americans by these same people that I just explained to you - that run the Kushners of the world, and the Order of the Black Sun - who got married, right? Were they aware? Yes. So they couldn't be committed while he was still in office, right? Because no one would view him as the Savior then. I mean, he's a great patriot and all of these types of things - and I know this is gonna upset a lot of people but it's the truth, and sometimes the truth hurts. I could sit here and I could tell you pleasant lies all day long, but that's not gonna help you wake up and not let the United States burn.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:55:38</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: And unless you speak Chinese, right, that's not gonna be good for anyone. It's not China per se. It's not the Chinese people per se. We have plenty of normal Chinese people that live in the United States. It is China's Deep State, which is in coordination with the American Deep State. That's the ones I'm talking about. That's who's playing together. So are you going to get benevolent Chinese elders to cash out your bonds tomorrow or whatever it is they're selling you these days? No. They had access to money until 2007, predominantly, and some even longer, those that worked with the Fed. Did you ever get any of it then? I mean, I think we just kind of got tortured, you know?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:56:35</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: You know, we have crime, we have them eating our children, we still have them doing all of these things and pedophile rings and, you know, that have been going on forever. I mean, I'm sure that some of these other stories will probably come out in the near future too, regarding people that you look at like, "Wow, this is an amazing human." And you think to yourself, he would never or she would never do something-something. And then, it turns out they do.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:57:06</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So if you are watching this from any of those camps and you do care just a little bit about the survival of the United States and you want to remain a free country and you're one of the generals or whoever was in the meeting yesterday, we have a solution for you. I told you that on the terminal when you called me. I also told you I didn't want to talk about it on the terminal, because everything that's in there goes into the Hall of Records and it may incriminate some people. But when something needs to be said, it needs to be said. And this is more about you than it is about anyone else.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:57:43</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: We do not want the country to erupt into a civil war. And this isn't just about America, okay? Because remember, America and the Federal Reserve were - or used to, I guess you would say - what happens here happens everywhere as they say. And this means if this linchpin goes, you can expect the whole African continent, the whole South American continent, Central America, you can expect all the continents to fall right along in line with it. And then we have a bunch of people, you know, right back where we started from. And we don't want to go back.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:58:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So I'm asking all of you to really listen to what I had to say today. I'm asking the generals to listen to what I had to say today. And I'm asking you, patriots, please, I know you're angry about the situation with Trump. There are memos circulating about the FBI going down. Not everybody that works there is bad. Not everybody that works in the military is bad. Not all soldiers are bad. You know, people are just people.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:58:54</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: And understand that some of them really do get up every day and try to defend your rights and try to do their best to make sure that no harm comes to you. There are others who don't, but most who do. Trust me when I tell you that the raid was warranted. It was warranted; it had to happen. Most of the information that came out of that is being looked at very heavily right now. You know, the solution is to be what you should have done - if you're watching this with the Trump family - back in December. That's the solution. There's other events that have to take place accordingly, too, for events that could possibly come up this December.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:59:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: But anyway, that's my update. That is my breaking news report, Ms. Sunny. Everybody is currently sequestered, I guess you would say, for the next 48 hours to make sure no one does anything to blow up the country. And I know you're sitting in meetings down the street - I wish you luck.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:00:08</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: Choose wisely, right Kim? Choose wisely.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:00:13</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: That's all I got to say, Miss Sunny. Got any questions?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:00:17</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sunny: I don't think so. None at this time. Can you hear me? I just want to make sure you can hear me.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:00:22</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: No, I can't hear you for some reason. All right, Mike - let's wrap it up!
