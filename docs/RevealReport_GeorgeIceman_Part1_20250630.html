        <strong>
        <br>George:  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Reveal Report, here on a Monday - a special episode as we get into the world news. Stay tuned for my special guest - someone we bring on every couple of months - Kimberly Goguen will be joining us very shortly. Stick around, it's going to be crazy and the topic is going to be amazing - we're going to get into it. People have seen this in the news. They've talked about it at water coolers. What's going on with Donald Trump and Elon Musk? We'll talk about tariffs, we'll talk about the war, and a few little things in between.
        </strong>
        <br>
        <br>If you're new, I thank you for joining. Please give us a like and subscribe. This little channel, over 55,000 subscribers on YouTube. And we are the Reveal Report. We talk about the supernatural, the paranormal, the occult, the esoteric. People want to hear about hauntings, ghosts, demonology. I spent 13 years studying the occult and going on different locations around the world to find ley lines, and locations that were haunted. Why were they haunted? People performing rituals at these places. We talk about these rituals on this channel. We talk about the things to watch out for and now almost everything you have learned may not be what it seems to be. So that's the type of channel, and I'm your host. I thank you for being here.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:02:37</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Hey, we got to do a quick shout-out guys, because of a few amazing people supporting the channel this week, especially for today's show - gotta do a special shout-out to these people. Let me get them over here... aah, here we go. All right special shout out to Vincent C. Vincent, thank you so much. Raffaella, Carmen S, and Catherine B, amazing. They sent a little something my way on PayPal, appreciating the content, what we produce and the information on the show.
        <br>
        <br>So again, special shout out to Vincent C.A. - thank you so much Vincent. Raffaella, thank you so much - that's one of my Patreon subscribers. Carmen S. And again, Catherine B. God bless. Give them a thank you in the comments below, really appreciate their efforts, and doing something to keep the show going on a Monday.

        <br>
        <br>George:  Now, again - we usually cover esoteric, occult, supernatural, paranormal, hauntings, ghosts, demons - that type of thing. People want to know about that. But - once every few months, I like to cover the news. And I'm not going to get into a long conversation, but it's surprising how I studied that - and that took me into the world of politics. You're not going to believe it, but it's a conversation for another day. How is the occult, the supernatural, how is ritual magic - has anything to do with politics? A talk for another day.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:03:55</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Today, I welcome the Ground Commander, someone who's extremely knowledgeable in the geopolitical world, understands currencies, banking - very successful as an entrepreneur herself in the world of finance - and it's a privilege and an honor to have her here. So please welcome Miss Kimberly Goguen. Kim, how are you?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:04:17</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Good? How are you?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:04:18</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  I'm good. Thank you for being here. Big show today. We're gonna get into it. We're gonna talk about Elon and Trump to begin. So I'm gonna ask everybody who's here to turn up their volumes, take a look. I'm going to begin with a clip and then we'll get your comments on it, Kim. (Kim: Okay.) So turn up your volumes and take a look, here's our first clip to get things started. Here we go.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:04:47</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Narrator:  It was a political partnership the likes of which America had never seen.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:04:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Donald-Trump:  He saved free speech. He created so many different great things. Take over, Elon. Yes, take over.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:04:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Narrator:  The world's richest man, and Donald Trump, leading his MAGA movement back to the White House.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:05:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Donald-Trump:  We have a new star. A star is born: Elon.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:05:13</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Narrator:  When Donald Trump returned to the presidency, the two only seemed to grow closer, with Elon Musk heading a team with the goal of slashing government spending.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:05:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Elon-Musk:  The team's all for bureaucracy.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:05:25</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Donald-Trump:  Elon is doing a great job. He's finding tremendous fraud and corruption and waste.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:05:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Narrator:  But like other relationships that have burned bright in their early days, this one has crashed back to Earth, fueled by a series of acrimonious posts on social media.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:05:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Newscaster1:  It's the kind of thing you usually see in a kindergarten, isn't it? A fallout in the playground, and it ends up with kids in tears and sent to sit on the naughty step.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:05:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Newscaster2:  It would be funny, but it's not because these are two very important people who are going at it online and dividing people even further.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:06:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Newscaster3:  Over the last week, the relationship between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has come apart seemingly in real time. With each social media post, the rift appears wider and wider. First, Musk slammed Trump's so-called big beautiful budget bill, calling its spending an abomination. Two days later, in the Oval Office, Trump told reporters he was very disappointed in Elon. 22 minutes later, Musk posted, "Without me, Trump would have lost the election. Such ingratitude." He followed with a post about the possibility of starting a new political party that represents the 80% of Americans in the middle. Trump wasted little time in responding, posting on his social media platform that Musk was wearing thin and that when he took away the EV mandate that forced everyone to buy electric cars, he just went crazy.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:07:00</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Donald-Trump:  He's not the first. People leave my administration... and they love us. And then at some point they miss it so badly, and some of them embrace it - and some of them actually become hostile. I don't know what it is, it's sort of Trump Derangement Syndrome.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:07:19</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Narrator:  Then, Musk posted what he called the "really big bomb," alleging that Donald Trump is in the files of the case against notorious sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein, and that's the reason they haven't been made public.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:07:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  So, a lot to take in - we'll leave the last part out for later - let's get into it. What transpired? What kind of light can you show on us and what do you know about these two and what happened?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:07:48</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, George, I'm going to ask you to stick around for this one because this is a really long story. So, specifically, let's ask some questions, that way I can get clarification on what you want - and then we'll go from there.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:08:01</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  All right. To begin, why was Elon upset over this particular bill? There was the bill that was being passed - he said it was passed really quickly in the House; people couldn't get a chance to read it. That happens in any party, in every country - we know that. It's a lot of mumbo-jumbo.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:08:18</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Nobody reads it. (George: Nobody reads it.) Ever. Like not once. No. They're thousands of pages long.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:08:25</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  So, it... apparently it was to be passed, and it was going to affect a lot of people and cost billions of dollars, to my understanding - I could be wrong. Let's get some clarification on that. What is the story behind that?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:08:40</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, first of all, the Big Beautiful Bill [chuckle] isn't so beautiful. There are a lot of angry donors because they're not getting what they want. Remember, people donate to political campaigns to get what they want. Bottom line. They don't do it because they like the guy. They don't do it to try to get the guy elected - because politicians are selected - that's pretty much how it works. And in this particular case, there are a lot of angry donors because things that they were promised are not in there.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:09:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Now. 5,000 some odd pages, did anybody read it? I'm sure there were very angry assistants that stayed up all night reading it - it's worse than "War and Peace." Is there war in there? Yes, there is. Is there a lot of money for a lot of operatives in there? Meaning, you know, war dogs - people that sell weapons, that kind of thing. The actual intention, you could read between the lines as to what they plan on doing with the United States. So yeah, there were a lot of angry people, Elon being one.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:09:49</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  5,000 is a lot of sheets to read to pass the bill, so there's obviously a lot of hidden agenda to get through, that they don't want you to figure out and circle and get to the negotiation table. We understand that - it sucks. But, you said there's some things there (in that comment that you made) that wasn't very good for the country. Any light you can shed on that, specifically?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:10:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, they'd like to have a civil war, and they would like taxpayers, I guess you could say, pay for it - somebody's going to pay for it. They would like to bring America to its knees, and then build it back up, I guess. Maybe he got on the Biden "Build Back Better" Bill.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:10:30</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  So, build it back up. They want to tear it down, build it back up. (Kim: Yes.) Is this anything to do - and again, I'm just asking questions because I think the viewers would like to know. Is this anything to do with... by tearing it down, it would initially hurt the dollar. Which is backed by, you know, your system, and oil, and trading, and other natural resources. By maybe destroying that and everything - would they try to implement (possibly) a new currency, which would be digital? Is that an option? Is that a possible part of the plan?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:11:06</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  They... See, controlling a currency is one thing - controlling the issuance of NEW currency is another thing. Right now they cannot control the dollar. They would like to but they cannot. So their idea - and this has been their idea all along - is to come up with some kind of crypto. Now, behind the scenes there have been several types of crypto. There's USN, USTC, U.S. this, U.S. that. So there's a lot of different types of crypto that they've tried to issue.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:11:38</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Problem with it is, Number 1, the dollar is everywhere. I mean, it's everywhere. You can't... Every country must trade in dollars, if you're buying any kind of commodity that you would see on the commodity futures market. Which is pretty much part of the food supply. Gold and silver, sure. Oil and gas... If you are Saudi Arabia, as an example, even if you produce oil in your country - which is questionable with Saudi Arabia - but even if you produce oil in your country, you must first buy dollars in order to sell your oil, or to buy and sell it. So. Yep. So that was mandated a long time ago back in the late 70s, early 80s. So that is how the dollar became so dominant. Now in the past, that was the British pound. After World War II, it moved to the dollar.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:12:30</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Now, the dollar has spread further because we do have a digital global banking system now. We have a lot more trading happening now than happened in the past at that time. I mean, we have gone decades. The things they don't understand is, Number 1, a lot of countries don't even have a lot of power - they have rolling brownouts. How are you going to get everyone in the world to bank with a cryptocurrency? You're not, is the answer to the question. Yeah, I don't know if you've seen it, but Trump even came out with the Q-phone... Or, the Trump...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:13:04</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Yes. Yeah, I don't know about the Q-phone, but it's the Trump phone with the Trump service.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:13:10</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Yeah, Trump phone and Trump service. (George: Yes.) Runs on five different carriers, the deal was made by the kids, we know all about it. And it's an attempt to try to get people to buy this god-awful, gaudy-looking phone at kind of an expensive rate compared to rates around the world. And so that everybody will buy the phone, and then trade in their cryptocurrency - this is the way they thought that they could get this job done. But unfortunately, there are countries, literally, that have dollars stacked in their central banks. What are you going to do about that? Now, all currency - even cryptocurrency - works on supply and demand. So even if they were able to exchange the cryptocurrency one for one, they still have these crazy lofty ideas of issuing quadrillions of dollars of this - not dollars, but trillions of whatever-coin into the market, which is going to crash it anyway. And they will not listen to anybody. They will not listen to their own economists and how this is wrong. So, is that in the bill? Yes. Was it supposed to be the Dodgy coin or DOGE coin or whatever Elon Musk puts out? Yes, it was supposed to be - but it's not in that bill.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:14:31</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Gotcha. So, again, I don't pretend to understand this type of stuff fully, because it's very complicated. I'm getting, you know, bits and pieces of my research. I hear what you have to say and others. I'm fascinated with it. To me, and correct me if I'm wrong - people who are in the chat are hearing - it seems to me that if you're creating the digital currency yourself, I mean, you have all the power, you hold the cards. You could ship as many coins as you want, to anybody you really like. Is that possible? Or, no you can't?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:15:01</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  No, you cannot. If you're going to... so even if they burned the U.S. economy to the ground, let's just say. And now, just like Great Britain was after World War II, we're a third-world country. We go into a depression for 10 years, which it would probably be longer, because everything they do makes no sense. So if that actually happens, and they introduce this new currency, and they're forcing everybody to use it - which they would - they would have to exchange the dollar one for one. Or, forfeit their global dominance. (George: Hmm.) Because, if they do not exchange the dollar one-for-one - give value to the dollar, that's the first thing they're going to have to do - If they don't do it, they will lose their global dominance. There are already countries out there that are saying they don't want the dollar, right? They're ready to walk away. You pull something like this - remember, the dollar is backed by the "good faith of the American government." Now, if you burn the country to the ground, I don't care if you call it the Poo-Poo Coin - it doesn't make a difference - because there is no faith in the American government.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:16:15</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Just like you, George. So say you and I do business together, and I borrow $100 from you or 100 Canadian, whatever, and you go, "Okay, no problem, Kim." "I'll pay you back next week. Okay, George? Don't worry." And I pay you back exactly on time. Constantly, right? All my debts are paid in full. And then maybe you come to me and you ask me for the same. Okay, great, you know, and you pay me back exactly when you say. This is the good faith between you and I. I didn't give you any collateral. I don't have any kind of, you know, other than a piece of paper that says I owe George $100, or an email probably, between us.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:16:54</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  But what happens when, you know, it's like public information? I lost my job. I lost any money I had. I lost my ability to make money. I tell you I lost my job. And can I borrow $100? And you're like... I don't know? Now you're going to start to think about it... Well, how are you going to pay me back? I heard you lost your job, you know. And this might work for a little while, and you can say, "Well, we have every intention of building the country back better, blah, blah, blah - I'm going to build myself back better George. You know, you might loan me a hundred bucks and see if I pay it back on time like I used to. If I don't, then what happens?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:17:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Well that's the issue. What happens? What do they do?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:17:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, word gets out now. All your bonds are no good. You know how many Treasury notes there are out there that other countries hold that are dollar denominated? Not only that, the people [hold] - a lot of people hold Treasury notes and bonds in their IRAs, retirement accounts - and this isn't just for the U.S. - this is worldwide.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:17:55</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Wow. I've heard rumblings, and I don't know what truth there is to it, but there's been a lot of fake bonds out there that were sold to a lot of people in power and positions, thinking that they were gonna be able to cash it in. Time came; they couldn't. They went bananas, they went nuts - because they were sold fake bonds. Is that true? Is that a real thing?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:18:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Absolutely that happened. Terminals, positions. You're going to have a big position - overthrow the government of Canada, overthrow the government in the Middle East there, for the larger-sized country. Now they're trying to overthrow the smaller-sized country, you know, in the public, that kind of thing. But listen, I know that you're upset about not being able to cash in your bonds, the other IOUs I gave you George - and I understand that - but I have, I'm going to let you in on a little trading deal.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:18:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  No, here we go.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:18:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  So I'm going to give you a U.S. note digital wallet. And I'm gonna put three times what I owe you in there (maybe it's a hundred times), and you are gonna be in on the ground floor. So, I'm gonna sell it to you at, like, pennies on the dollar here. Or pennies on the dollar - whatever crypto.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:19:13</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Oh, hold on! There it is. So they're not even getting it at an exchange - they're gonna get it for pennies on the dollar. So there's still money coming for them. (Kim: Yeah.) And they're gonna give you this fake currency that... look at that. And what a scheme.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:19:29</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  And then, how do you think they bought those big pointy things that were flying back and forth over the pond somewhere? (George: Wow.) I'm trying to be gentle here, where, you know - we're on that place that you're not supposed to talk about these things. So anyway, but how do you think they bought them? They sold... I mean, there's...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:19:49</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Pennies on the dollar. (Kim: Yep.) For a digital wallet. That is not yet. Again. Again, so they've done it several times for a digital wallet that is not yet working, correct?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:20:00</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  That is correct. They even paid operatives, and those that sell, you know, pointy, big pointy boom things [missiles] - you know, that kind of stuff. They sold a lot of that and were paid in this currency. So everybody's waiting for this to happen. So now, these people that have all of this stuff are willing to help you burn the United States to the ground. That's what they're doing.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:20:26</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  In order to push forward this agenda for this new currency. Let me ask you straight up: from your research and your experience in the financial market, do you believe this is going to happen anytime soon?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:20:39</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  No. Number 1, BRICS tried it. Remember the BRICS coin? (George: Yes.) So I personally spoke to someone at the Treasury Department of South Africa, who told me that he has the wallet. And it's only for the elite in the country. And he doesn't need any help and they don't need anything in the country because he has the digital wallet. See? And this was going to be good at the BRICS meeting, in August - 2 years ago. Did he ever cash in that wallet? Nope. Nope. And then they tried to launch the coin several times, but even with the computing power of China and Russia behind it, they could not sustain even the transactions amongst themselves, let alone sustain the amount of transactions if all of their citizens were to convert to their currency.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:21:35</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  And the power's not there, and the fiber isn't there. You know, we all know that the - well, maybe you don't - but the CIA ran all that fiber a long time ago. So, you either get fiber or you don't get fiber, and if you don't have fiber it's because they told you you can't have it. Or, they can cut you off at any time - if they don't like what you're doing, they'll cut your whole country off. That actually happened to me once.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:22:00</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Really? (Kim: Yep.) I mean, I've heard of these wars between countries. They use a type of blackmail - again, this is just rumors and speculation here - and I've heard that they've used the weaponry called HAARP. And they would use HAARP and weather warfare on other countries if they didn't pay their dues or pay a certain amount of tax per year. Is that true, not true? What have you heard about that?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:22:25</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  You know, HAARP was connected to a much larger system, (George: Okay...) and they could have done things like that. They also lowered the age of consensual sex in a lot of countries - I know that for a fact. They would throw in the henchmen, like the World Bank henchmen. Did you know that the World Bank has its own intelligence agency?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:22:48</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Wow, I did not.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:22:49</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  It's an extension of other American agencies - but yes, they do. They will send in people to threaten you. Now, remember all these politicians - like you said, George - are all members, they're card-carrying members of the occult, right? So everybody's got dirt. Do you want all that to come out in the public?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:23:06</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  You do not.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:23:06</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  This is how it's done, you know. So it's political manipulation, on and on and on and on and on and on, you know? And do what we say, or this happens.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:23:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  It's unbelievable. Now, I want to touch on that for one second. You know, they say a lot of these people are actors, and they get put in a position where they have to play a role. But there's been a few, there's been a few Kim, that have gone with an innocent heart, with a great mind that wanted to actually do well and make changes. One being Jesse Ventura, a former professional wrestler, turned actor. Thought he'd run for governor because he was...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:23:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Former CIA agent.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:23:52</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Yes, but he specifically came out publicly and said, on the day of his inauguration, where he became in power, he was invited to a room in the basement where he was told things are gonna go a certain way on how we want it and so forth. He basically in not so many words said, "This is all controlled." And he really didn't have much say anyway, on a lot, because he was gonna be told what to do and what to say. What are your thoughts on those allegations that he said he got into...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:24:20</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  He got into - when you say he, he was pulled into the basement and was asked about what?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:24:29</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Well, he wasn't asked. He was told - he wasn't asked. (Kim: Who? Ventura?) Jesse Ventura was told, "This is how it works, and this is what you're going to do," moving forward, on these decisions and so forth. In not so many words.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:24:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  That is correct.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:24:43</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  That is correct? Okay.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:24:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Yeah. That happens with every politician. (George: Wow.) Yeah. Absolutely, 100% - there is no exception. But, remember, they attend all the meetings too, usually. Those are all bloodline political families right? So. (Yeah.) So is it a surprise?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:25:00</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  No. I know in the magical circles, or in the occult circles, you don't really get... you don't really get in. It is very rare that you get into a particular group, let's just say, a particular association if they can't track your bloodline. It is all through connection of the blood and the family name. And if they can't track you, well guess what? You're not going up into these upper echelons/these circles. There were certain schools, a while ago, I mean the people would be 70 and 80 year-old teachers, and the students were chosen based on their bloodline, and their last name. And these particular schools are the ancient mystery schools. And they would teach you everything. They would go down the line and you would learn everything from A to Z. I don't know if those exist anymore, and if they do it's far and in between, I'm sure. But I just mention it because it's the same thing with politics. Usually it's through a bloodline, a family member, or something. Or are you chosen? Is it possible that you are chosen for that position if they find a place for you?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:26:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Usually... in the past, and it's been a little rocky lately, so, I would say it started getting really rocky probably right around the time of the first administration. Not because he wasn't already chosen - he was already told that he would be. It's just, that's when the outcomes became weird, we didn't see as many Bohemian Grove meetings, and all of those meetings would dictate, you know, presidents for the next several years. I mean in every country - not just America.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:26:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  This was cut.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:26:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Yeah. I have another little dirty secret about that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:26:56</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Please share.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:26:57</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  And I'm going to be very polite about this. Thank you. Every head of state that you see on TV has been on their knees for another man.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:27:08</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Wow. (Kim: Mmhmm.) That's some serious information there Kim. That's quite the allegation. Meaning in a sexual way - is that what you're saying?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:27:18</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  I'm saying there's been a sexual act performed in order to show their obedience, and to reinforce the power of the person that selected them. Just in case they ever forget - it is videotaped. (George: Wow.) So there's a whole archive of all of these on file and yeah.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:27:40</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  It's interesting. It's almost like the history of the Knights Templar. They would go in the bottom of the church, in the basement of the church, and they would have all these people go to the master on their knees, and they would have to kiss them in the...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:27:57</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Places where they shouldn't be.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:27:59</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Yes. Thank you. They would have to do that. That was then. So it's not dramatic that things have changed that much that they wouldn't do that. That was then. The Knights Templar. That was then. So I can only imagine now.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:28:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  It's also not uncommon, George, for presidents to exchange children. (George: Geez.) Yeah, underage children at parties. They're like party favors, you know.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:28:26</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Wow. That's Joe Rogan material right there. That is some crazy... Like Joe Rogan would definitely be able to talk about this type of stuff on a broader scale, because he's got 50 million followers or something like that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:28:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  And a whole lot of CIA backing.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:28:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  And a whole lot of CIA backing? Does he really?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:28:47</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Yep.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:28:49</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Is this why he gets to speak about certain topics that no one else can?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:28:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  That's right. You and I can have a conversation on the same channel - Spotify or otherwise - and you know, we'd be cut down, shut down. You'd get flagged and all that stuff - but not him. No, that's because he's a part of the program. He's a part of the system.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:29:09</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Look at that. All right.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:29:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Sold out.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:29:13</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Let's get back to the finish. Something I want to touch on briefly, if you can, and you don't have to if you don't want to, because I'm just fascinated. There was an accusation made by Elon Musk to Donald Trump that says the reason that the lists were not released to the public - Elon Musk claims - that Donald Trump's name was on those lists.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:29:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  It is.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:29:37</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  It is on those lists.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:29:38</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Yeah. And there's actually, I think they're probably from the 80s or 90s, based on the way the women are dressed. But there are actual videos that - they might be buried by now, but there are videos - if you use the Wayback Machine and you know how to do that on the internet you can find those videos. Where he is standing with Epstein, and they are looking at all the women in the room, and they're clapping and talking and they're selecting and pointing them out. So, yeah, absolutely. (George: Wow.) Also part of the same organization.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:30:17</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Wow. So he's made an accusation. They went back and forth. There was a lot of heat. They weren't talking - the Tesla stocks dropped - it was insane, Kim. And they weren't talking. But something happened, I guess some type of conversation occurred between both of them. They were interviewing Trump. I'm gonna let you hear what he has to say. So, everybody take a listen: this is what Trump had to say after his argument with Elon Musk, maybe a week or so later. Here it is.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:30:47</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Maria-Bartiromo:  Mr. President, have you spoken to Elon Musk? What happened there?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:30:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Donald-Trump:  I think he's a wonderful guy. I haven't spoken to him much, but I think Elon is a wonderful guy and I know he's gonna do well always. He's a smart guy and he was in the... he actually went and campaigned with me, and this and that. But he got a little bit upset, and that wasn't appropriate.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:31:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Maria-Bartiromo:  Why did he get upset? He just wasn't getting what he wanted?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:31:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Donald-Trump:  Look, the electric vehicle mandate - the EV mandate - is a tough thing for him, I would think. I don't want everybody to have to have an electric car. You know, I campaigned on "you have choice." If you want a gasoline powered, if you want a hybrid, if you want - I love the electric, I love his cars, I think he's fantastic - but not everybody should have that, and not everybody wants that. And Biden, who's so stupid, he said everybody has to have an electric car by what, 2030? Okay? I think he said by 2030, which is in five years. Everybody... people don't want that. And how do you do that when you don't have enough electricity? You can go to California - where they want everybody to have an electric car - and yet they have brownouts and blackouts every weekend.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:31:57</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  He does have a point. There's blackouts every weekend; there's a mess there. But I'd like to get your feedback on this. You know, it would help - definitely - Elon, with everyone having an electric car by 2030. It would make him more than a trillionaire, he'd probably be... I don't even want to know the amount of money he would have - and power, which goes with it - if that was to happen. What are your thoughts on this? Any light you could shed between this battle between, you know, the electric vehicle? Because Canada, in Canada, they're doing the same thing. They want to push this carbon tax, and they want to take away gas cars - and only electric - and I just want to get your feedback. What do you know about this type of stuff? What's happening?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:32:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, okay. First of all, Elon Musk personally and professionally donated a significant amount - billions of dollars - to the Trump campaign. On the promise that his DOGE/Dodgy coin, or whatever it's called - it's the same thing as the name of the department there - and the department was under the Treasury, so the name DOGE became very familiar. So it made sense that they were going to launch the DOGE Coin - you know, that they could pull that off in the media. And when it didn't happen, and there was a payday ending in Y - you know, they're always promising that they're gonna pay everybody, and nobody gets paid anything - and it didn't happen, he finally flipped. You know, everything was suffering. They bled the man dry. He spent billions, and I'm talking about ridiculous amounts of donations.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:33:38</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Now, the whole electric car thing - come on, man. I mean, that's just common sense. I say that because irrespective of the fake power shutoffs in California - which happens all the time, it has to do with the dam - but anyway, okay. So let's just say California never had a brownout, never had people - which I do know personally, based on what a friend has told me - that they have lost power a few times a week, sometimes days at a time. And they all have generators in specific areas. They claim it's because of the winds and there could be a fire. They don't seem to care about the other fires that go on in California, but this is very important. Now, is it real, not real? Yeah, I don't think it's really real. But I will add to that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:34:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  So, electric vehicles and the batteries that are currently used in them are highly explosive. They, you know, China's using thorium, they're using lithium. But if you are in a car accident in an electric vehicle, you very well could explode. (George: Wow.) Yeah, on impact. So there's that part of it, first of all. Number 2, they have way better technology - even Elon has way better technology - SpaceX is a Rothschild company, I don't know if you know that. Has been for years, founded by them. Used to bank at Bank of New York Mellon; I know that for a fact.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:35:18</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Wow. Breaking news here folks, breaking news.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:35:20</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  That is a fact. So, that being said, that is how he got his millions. He is the new "Stephen Hawking," and what I mean by that is, he was supposed to be the "panel of experts" for all science. So he would be the one to get on TV, tell everybody about all these great innovations - that aren't really innovations at all. And then if anybody comes forward, you know, say a scientist from a university or wherever comes forward with a technology, he can say, "Oh, that technology won't work," if they don't want it. Or they'll go steal it and use it for themselves. So that's kind of what his job is in the movie. You know, his job was to do that. He really wasn't supposed to be in politics, in any way, really - but things aren't going very well on the free money train and the Rothschild train. So he thought he'd hump onto the Trump operative train - and they're part of the same organization - so, the Trump operatives crashing America, buy it back for pennies on the dollar with fake whatever coin they're gonna call it, yeah, it's all in the name of the game.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:36:30</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  As far as Elon getting angry, well, that's pretty much what it's about. Now they were - by the way, Trump is wrong - they were supposed to actually mandate electric vehicles in California, I think by next year. If I remember correctly. (George: Wow!) They also tried to ban all gas stoves and you know, crazy things - like, within a year. I'm like, who's gonna do that? Who can do that? Can anybody afford to go buy, you know, replace the stove in your home right now? Like, how is this going to happen? There's a lot of crazy policies that have been coming out, basically because you have chickens with no head trying to run governments. That's really what's happening, bottom line.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:37:10</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  But, Kim, I'm confused. Because it makes no sense. It's just not feasible to go all out fully electronic. Is it possible that it's two different groups fighting each other? One controls the diesel fuel that powers certain things - maybe the fossil fuels - another one controls the electric. How do people not see through this? This doesn't make sense. There is no way to have electric everything and not have the grid come down.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:37:43</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, beyond the grid, George. Because you know what? Common sense, anybody who has actually done something and not just had it appear randomly, would know that there are hardly any charging stations, Number 1. Number 2, California is probably one of the largest tourist states in the United States. I mean, you know, it's also got Silicon Valley and all kinds of things. So can you explain to me what you're going to do when a tourist from, say, Arizona or another state tries to cross the border with their gas car? Do you have to buy a new car to go to California? Are you kidding me right now? Disneyland is there. What are you talking about right now? SeaWorld, Six Flags. I mean, families take trips from across the country to go to this state and you're going to do what - stop everybody at the border? You know, where are we? That's not our state anymore? I mean, and there's no charging stations for this, George.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:38:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Yeah.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:38:43</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  And what are they going to do if they live in an area like my friend lives in, where the power goes out for three days? You know, nobody's going to show up for work? You make no sense. And this was actually relayed to these people, and then eventually, hey, you know, they thought it was a bad idea. But they do things first and think later - that's the problem.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:39:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Bizarre. All right. Let's move along with another important thing, is the tariff war. Tariffs, there's negotiations, some are paying, some are not paying - it's a money grab, I get it. But things have really heated up with Canada, especially between the U.S. and Canada. And I'm gonna begin by playing this clip. It was called off! There was something that went on this week. There were negotiations with the tariffs and the taxes and Trump just cut them off at the knees. Here's what the news reported. Take a listen. Let me play this clip. Here it is.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:39:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kelly-Evans:  As mentioned, President's comments on cutting off trade discussions with Canada. We have more details with Megan Casella here to recap exactly what's happened. Megan.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:39:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Megan-Casella:  Kelly, the potential for new and higher tariffs against Canada now, maybe the trade war heating back up at least with Canada, after the president posted on Truth Social just a few moments ago that, because Canada is moving forward with a digital services tax that will impact U.S. companies that... he says, because of that, we are hereby terminating all discussions on trade with Canada effective immediately. He says we will let Canada know the tariff that they will be paying to do business with the U.S. within the next seven day period. So Kelly, this is a digital services tax that Canada had been expected to, or the U.S. was hoping Canada might not move forward, with after the U.S. decided to take out that section 899 revenge tax from the ongoing negotiations over that tax and spending bill that's in Congress. They moved yesterday to remove that. I've been told they were using that as negotiating leverage with other countries and hoped that countries like Canada wouldn't then move forward.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:40:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Megan-Casella:  Now Canada is moving forward with this tax. Trump says, because of that, all trade talks are off the table and he'll be naming a new tariff rate within the next week. I will emphasize though, Canada doesn't have quite as much to lose on the tariff front as other countries do at this point - they're not facing a July 9th deadline. And while there is a 25% tariff now on Canadian imports, anything traded under the USMCA is exempt. So that means that at least the majority of their goods are exempt from those tariffs at this point, but then again, there are sector-specific tariffs on steel and aluminum and cars as well. We're seeing some impact there but sort of a wait-and-see as to what happens in the next seven days.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:41:22</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Newscaster3:  Megan Casella, thank you very much.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:41:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  So, you know...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:41:26</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  What was the date of that report, George?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:41:28</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  That was this week - that was two, three days ago.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:41:31</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Okay.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:41:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Okay. So now, Canada was going to implement a 3% tax or something, on certain digital assets. For instance - Amazon, Google, Facebook - of their earnings, they wanted 3% of the country. I think that was in a bill where they were going to move that out to negotiate. So I find it interesting that... I guess Trump didn't hear about this, got very upset and angry, and cut all ties. Now as of, I believe July 9th - I could be wrong, but I think July 7th to 9th - he's planning on raising the tariffs. That's the plan. Or at least that's what he's going to approach and say to the audience. What are your thoughts and comments on what this broadcast just said?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:42:15</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Okay, well, first of all, you told me that that report was 2 or 3 days ago. So that must mean, say Friday of last week, right?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:42:21</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Yeah.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:42:21</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, they're expecting a big windfall by this Friday.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:42:26</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  This what?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:42:27</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  They're expecting a big windfall at the U.S. government by this Friday. Didn't you hear?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:42:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  No.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:42:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well you see, in the past, the budget was always assigned on that day for the following year. That's all countries, by the way, just so you know. So the real fight here is that promises go undelivered; countries make a reaction or have a reaction; then they're told they're going to be punished like little children for not understanding that Trump is the king of the world - didn't you know? Or whatever those people are in there. (George: Yes.) Yeah. That they're the kings of the world and you will do what we say, because we said, "You need to do what we say."
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:43:12</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Now, he was trying to buy Canada. He was trying to buy Canada in some way, shape, or form - and I think maybe you touched on it about two months ago or so. Or it was even before that, where you said that your intel said that they were truly serious. (Kim: Yeah.) They were legit serious. They actually legit serious wanted to take over Canada. This was a real thing.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:43:34</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Legit. Yep. They want to take over Canada, Mexico - actually have one currency for all of North America.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:43:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  That gets scary to me, because that goes back now to documents that were released 20 years ago, and they would turn the world into zones. And zones would have currency. I think the original zone for Canada, I forgot the number of what it was - but Canada, Mexico, the U.S. - and they had a currency, would have been called the Amero.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:44:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  They tried the Amero, the Rainbow dollar, now it's insert-crypto-coin here.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:44:12</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Gotcha. Wow. So now do you see, is he going to threaten Canada, maybe other countries as well, come the end of the week or something in regards to more tariffs to these countries?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:44:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, the purpose behind the tariffs, you need to understand, are about burning America to the ground. No offense, but we are an import country. It was set up that way. Because when we started the Federal Reserve, etc., etc., we have deals with other countries, whereby everything needs to be imported. And that we would just sell dollars, and that the manufacturing base of America would shrink - which it did. You know, it definitely did. Speaking of that, I just wanted to make a point about tariffs also. Did you know that the Trump administration appointed the Federal Reserve to handle all the tariff money cuts going to be coming in?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:45:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Oh goodness! Of course. That's a great idea.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:45:10</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Isn't that a great idea? (George: Not!) Let's do that, right? I thought this guy was trying to make America - burn the Federal Reserve, you people say in your social media - to the ground. Bull crap. He wants to give them all the tariffs of the world to manage.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:45:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Listen, if you trust a politician, I've always said, when these politicians are not kissing babies, they're stealing their lollipops. All of them! And Unfortunately, some people praise Trump like he's the savior of the world. I mean, I don't think anyone should be treated as the savior of the world. I don't care how much you like him. And maybe he has one or two policies that can make sense, and, you know, it resonates with you, I'm okay with that - I understand that. You know, it's the Devil you know as opposed to the Devil you don't know. I get that aspect that you've been taught all these years. However, people put him on a pedestal like he's the greatest thing that ever happened. And I just don't put any human being... The only person I ever put on a pedestal was Jesus Christ, who I believe died for our sins and sacrificed himself for us. And I don't think no other human after him should be treated that way, but some people just do that. Here's an update! Kevin says Carney has since removed that tax. That's what this follower has said. I'm yet to look at and confirm that - but that's what he said. I'll have to confirm maybe in the After Show. Speaking of which, Kim...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:46:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Let me know what happens after Friday of next week.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:46:39</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Ha ha! We have a full moon on Friday of next week?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:46:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  No, it's July 4th. I don't know what that... you know, it's some big... It's not just about America though. This was the day when the entire world would get enormous budgets
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:46:52</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Yeah.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:46:52</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  And that has not actually happened since 2012.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:46:55</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Well good luck with that. I'm curious to see what transpires here. Hey, special after show, a Q&A coming up next with Kim on Patreon, right after this show. You can click the link in the description below. Come on board and have a quick talk with us. She may not be able to ask everyone's questions and be there, but she usually does a pretty good job, and we thank her for that. Following this show on Patreon, a Q&A coming up next. All right, We're gonna end the show. I got a question for you here. I'm gonna play another clip. We're talking about the war. The war, we saw the war, and it was between two countries, but America came in - they had enough of bad business, and they didn't want any more. And here's what Donald Trump had to say in a quick presser after he nuked Iran, or, I wouldn't say nuked - but dropped a few bombs. Here's what he has to say, take a listen, I'll get your comments. Here it is.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:47:47</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Donald-Trump:  A short time ago, the U.S. military carried out massive precision strikes on the three key nuclear facilities in the Iranian regime: Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. Everybody heard those names for years as they built this horribly destructive enterprise. Our objective was the destruction of Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity, and a stop to the nuclear threat posed by the world's number 1 state sponsor of terror. Tonight, I can report to the world that the strikes were a spectacular military success. Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated. Iran - the bully of the Middle East - must now make peace. If they do not, future attacks will be far greater and a lot easier.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:48:48</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  So. He dropped some bombs, he said there was a nuclear plant. It was dangerous if that's the case.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:48:55</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Baloney.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:48:55</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  It's baloney. It's baloney!
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:49:00</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  First of all, just to give you like five seconds of logistics here, okay? Number 1, the base - the Fordow, the one that he's talking about - I personally know sits at well over 276 meters deep, so - I mean, sorry, not meters - feet deep. So meters-wise, what's that? Brings me about to 80 something meters. Bunker busters can't go down that far - that didn't happen. So, B2 or otherwise - didn't happen. Sorry, didn't happen. Number 2, if it was a live nuclear facility, even if it was under the ground that far, and let's just say, they have these special bunker busters that Trump probably built with his own two hands, I'm sure. Then they hit it. Wouldn't there have been a massive earthquake? Yes, there would have been a massive earthquake - think about that. Remember Fukushima? That's above ground. Think about what would happen below ground. There would be a massive earthquake in the area.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:50:01</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Was there a massive earthquake? Absolutely not. They tried to cover their backs by saying... (Wow, I'm cutting out bad - nobody wants to hear me say this, I guess. [chuckle]) So they tried to cover their backs by saying that there was a 5.1 earthquake in the big, bigger place over there, further to the east. And in the bigger place further to the east, that has occurred days before - in an area far away from these locations. So sorry, I don't buy any of that. I don't - not even close.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:50:40</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Really?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:50:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  No, not even close, Number 1. Number 2, in the 80s, the U.S. - through the little tiny country that they're fighting with there (I'm being YouTube appropriate to the little tiny country) - actually, because they didn't sign a proliferation treaty for nuclear weapons. They actually gave them to them. Said, "Here, have some." So, they're all in it together. There's a big story that's been going around for a couple of years, that's not a story. Khamenei, the Imam there, is just as dirty as the Pope. So he's kind of like the Islamic Pope, you could say, and Khomeini before him. So Khamenei actually goes to Russia - Belarus - a couple years ago, to do a ceremony. In which he thought - because he is the chosen one and I am the bloodline of blah blah (it doesn't matter what it is) - but he goes there, he does the thing, and well, it didn't really work out. Because he didn't make it back.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:51:45</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Now, as far as what happened there, now they appointed somebody else to hold the position - you know, they love their mask wearing fake people, everywhere really. So he would be more of a Green Dragon slash Rothschild side. So America, they've also sided very heavily with China, as you know. And on the other side you have the Trump operatives wanting to take over every country in the world. Part of the reason why they want to do this is because they believe - and if you've ever heard of Cestui Que Vie, and Vatican and soul control and you know all that kind of thing, where you're dead by the age of eight, birth certificates. Well, all that ownership is kind of a real thing. So these guys play games on a smaller level because they don't understand the big game. So they feel that if they take over all the countries, force these ridiculous tariffs, it's going to get them to cow tail, so they'll turn over their country and citizens to America, and which by then they feel they would be in control of the most souls on the planet.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:53:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Well, you know, this is interesting when you're talking about most souls on the planet, are you referring to loosh soul energy for manifestation and power in the supernatural realm?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:53:15</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  I am actually, George. I try not to go there, unless you mention it first though. But yes, why yes. Yes, that's exactly what it's related to.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:53:25</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  I think we're gonna stop right there, and we're gonna continue this conversation in regards to what soul batteries are. (Kim: [whispering] It doesn't work that way.) Yeah, yeah, interesting. Well folks, there you have it. We're gonna continue the conversation on Patreon. Coming up next for the After Show, we're gonna do a Q&A, and get into these soul energies; we're gonna get into a little bit of the occult. And I gotta ask you Kim, where is the throne? There's a magical throne people could sit on. (Kim: Yes.) It's supposed to be powerful, it's moved around - and people are anointed. Don't answer - I'm just putting the question out there, but don't answer. Save that! But guys, it exists!
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:54:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  I know, I know, I know the answer!
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:54:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  You know the answer. (Kim: I do.) Save that answer, that can be coming up in the After Show. We're gonna get more into the occult nature of politics, and what's going on the geopolitical realm - right on Patreon. Coming up next - link in the description. Kim, thank you so much for being here. I appreciate it. If we could leave a piece of hope with everyone who's watching today - if they could take something from this that's positive - what message do you have for everyone?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:54:28</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  I would tell you that this really is all noise. That your consciousness is extremely important - and more important now than ever. And if you want to make it stop, you can make it stop. You, in cooperation with God. So stick with God, with God all things are possible. Put your intent there. Make sure when you're doing that, it's all of the things you would like to see. Make sure it's not more "what's going on in the Middle East right now" thing. You know, make sure it's "my family is safe, my family is healthy, my family has everything they need." You know, things like that, and I can promise you that Source has more, or God has more influence on this planet now than ever.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:55:20</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  So well said. Love it. (Kim: So stick with Him.) Love what you just said: protect your energy, starve the Devil, do not consent. I love it. Beautiful, beautiful comment. So many other great comments here. Guys, thank you for watching, I appreciate it. On behalf of Kim and myself, I want to thank you all for watching. Join us for the After Show, coming up next on Patreon. Links in the description. Guys, it's been a heck of a show.
        <br>
        <br>I have to agree with Kim - don't waste your energy watching the political theater. We refer to it as "political theater," as they use your energy to manifest their desires. Don't do it - get outside, go swimming, go for a walk. Laugh, smile, raise your vibration. Share love: the most powerful feeling on the planet. And give grace and glory and praise to God Almighty. Thanks for watching. We'll see you on Patreon coming up next. God bless. Good night everyone.
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Good night.
        <br>
