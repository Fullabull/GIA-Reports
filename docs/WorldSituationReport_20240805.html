<!-- TEASER:-->
<br>
<br>And now, the World Situation Report, with Kimberly Goguen from the Office of the Guardian. What is the real story behind stock market declines worldwide? The global military made a $2.9 trillion mistake. The battle for Lions Gate continued over the weekend as the gateway to Source peaked on Saturday, the secret reason behind the war in the Middle East. The economic hierarchy of the world and the flow of money now; currency explained.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Now here's the World Situation Report, with Kimberly Goguen and the Office of the Guardian.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening, everyone. Let's talk about what happened over the weekend. We had a lot of stuff moving in the world, both good and bad. But for the most part, everything that they're doing will ultimately be for our best good.
<br>
<br>00:37:35
<br>
<br>So there was a conversation that I had back in 2013, and I've mentioned it to you before, if you've been following me for a while, whereas the Rothschild family basically said that they would crash the dollar, crash the world's economy, and then buy everything back for pennies on the dollar. And we've talked about this before because they've attempted this several times, and then, of course, when they don't have the money to complete this task, we go right back to where they started, and the markets come back up and there's no problems. This time, this was a little bit different. Was the Order of the Dragon involved? Yes. Were the Rothschild family involved? Yes, they were.
<br>
<br>00:38:25
<br>
<br>So here is the reason why we saw a sharp decline on Friday in the markets and also a decline today somewhat that looks like it's, I guess you would say, somewhat recovering at this point. What we're seeing is a siphon, essentially. On Friday I talked about the fact that we thought that they got about, nah, between 70 to 80 million dollars, which in part was true. The amount of money that was received to get the war in the Middle East started was around that amount, and that was the amount that was actually released to the military and to other folks to get the arms dealers and so on and so forth. But the total amount from all global markets worldwide was somewhere around $2.9 trillion. Unfortunately for these people, they never learn. So they took this $2.9 trillion, put it into an off-ledger account, and began trading against that 2.9 trillion - not really sure what they were trading - probably government bonds, loads of promises and zero delivery. They used it as flash cash over the weekend to get some of these groups in the Middle East that are participating in the show to start, firing rockets and this and that over the weekend, and it's gone kind of up and down. But at the end of the day, they couldn't get the money back into the system.
<br>
<br>00:40:11
<br>
<br>So there were about three or four facilities within the U.S., most of them inside mountains, so you would consider them latent facilities that they tried to revive during Lions Gate. And they were pretty much around the main point of Lions Gate, which would have been in Yellowstone Park. And we talked about the Oracle and why that was a main point in the world last week. So they siphoned it into these facilities, began creating numbers for money, which is not currency, and they ended up ramping up these fictitious numbers to somewhere around $880 trillion. Now. They couldn't get it back into the system. That's the problem. And we're going to talk about that in a little bit about the economic hierarchy of the world because I think it's important for everybody to understand when I say things don't work, why they don't work, and why there is only one way to fix this.
<br>
<br>00:41:18
<br>
<br>So by Sunday, they started calling - of course, through contacts that they have of mine, never me directly, of course - and they started calling and asking for a meeting, asking for help. Then, when we said, "No, we can't help you; we won't help you," they came back and went and tried some more hacking to see if they could get some more money from somewhere. Of course, there's no trading on the weekends except for FX, which is currency trading for a short period of time. Then they would come back an hour or two later after they failed, and then they would go back and then ask again, and we would say no, and then they'd go back and try something else, and then that wouldn't work out. Then they come back. This happened probably about eight or nine times all day long on Sunday - yesterday.
<br>
<br>00:42:09
<br>
<br>Now why can't we help them? Number 1, it is abundantly clear that they really do not understand macro and microeconomics on any level. Number 2, they obviously don't learn from their previous mistakes because this has been going on for probably about five or six years now, where they, ever since the advent of the Key Integrated Monetary System, they haven't figured out that once they take it out of the system and put it into any kind of an off-ledger server or remote server, why they can't get this quote-unquote money back into the system. And that problem is even worse now than it ever was with the advent of currency versus money or credits. They want me; I know what they want from me; they would like me to put allocation numbers to their money, this $880 trillion, so that they - it's not all dollars by the way, it's various other currencies around the world; you had RMB in the pool, you also had rubles in the pool, and so on and so forth. And a lot of promises made to these respective countries should they be successful.
<br>
<br>00:43:25
<br>
<br>Yeah. Well, that didn't quite work out. We did find the International Treasury Transfer Reserve System which is an old system that was tied to the Plunge Protection Committee, not only for U.S. market plunges but also for deep drops in other markets in the world as well, like the UK and everywhere there's a treasury, which is every country in the world, and that's how they were siphoning it out the back door. In addition to that, they had all of their players in the game, such as Buffett and Soros - I call these bagmen - Rockefellers and other large hedge funds, BlackRock, all in on it as well. Therefore, there was a large sell-off, and there continues to be a significant increase in sell-offs. The market's been down anywhere between 1200 to around 950-960 today. They continue to try to repeat today, in cooperation with all of their bagmen, the same thing they did on Friday, because somehow all of that fictitious money evaporated over the weekend, probably within 24 hours of this game and this scam, including the money that they siphoned out of the market.
<br>
<br>So there's another almost $3 trillion U.S. dollar equivalent in various currencies that has left the banking system as liquidity. Now, I know this sounds a little bit scary, but it's not really at this moment. The lack of liquidity in the banking system and the fall in the markets is a positive for humanity as a whole.
<br>
<br>00:45:22
<br>
<br>I know everybody's hitting the panic button, and it's all over alternative media: "We're all gonna die." Insert Nesara/Gesara; now it's Trumpsara out there, but none of those things are actually the case. What will happen in the future is that it will allow us regular humans - not me per se, but regular humans - to actually acquire some of these large corporations and larger hedge funds and start running them right once they all go bankrupt. So if they continue to try to crash the market, it's only going to help us in the long run recover faster. Think about how we could change the world if we could acquire some of these large corporations for literally pennies on the dollar or currency.  In currency. Actually spendable usable cash in a banking system.
<br>
<br>00:46:18
<br>
<br>Now, once the Rothschilds today got wind of this not working and they got wind of the fact that I am refusing to give them allocation numbers, let alone even have a conversation at this moment, because I know a conversation with these people is going to end the same way it always ends, "Well, here's what you're going to do." And I come back and say, "No, I'm not." And then there's some kind of threat that takes place. Possibly some other guy comes in and tries to flirt or something like that, and we still end up at the same place, with them not getting any allocation numbers and me not helping. That's pretty much what ends up happening every single time.
<br>
<br>They are not ready. They have not banged their heads up against the wall enough times yet to understand that this is never going to happen. It's not going to work the way they want it to work anymore. The system has changed, the currency has changed, and we're going to go into that a little bit more. And the world has changed. I know that they're fighting for world domination, and I can appreciate and respect that, but that's not where we're going in this world, and that's not how the world is going to work.
<br>
<br>00:47:34
<br>
<br>What I witnessed on Sunday was very similar to, well, let me tell you a little personal experience of mine. When my daughter was little, I had bought her - she was probably about three years old or so, maybe four - and for her birthday, I bought her one of those Barbie Jeeps. If you've ever seen them, they've got the battery power in the back, and she starts. She gets in it. We put it all together, and she gets in it, and she starts driving around the backyard. And at the time, I had these large, six-foot or so concrete block walls where I lived. And my yard wasn't very large - my backyard, my garden - wherever you're listening to this from. So she starts driving around, and she kept banging into the walls, and she thought it was funny. And so she would then go ahead and bang against the same wall at the same speed she did last time. And she would do this repeatedly until she just got bored. But you know, I mean, this went on for an hour. You know, it was so amusing to her the first time that she drove it to crash into the wall like that.
<br>
<br>And that's what they did all day, all weekend long. Not only that, they went ahead and repeated the process today, meaning they had siphoned somewhat about a billion dollars, maybe a little bit more into this off-ledger or banking system. It's not a banking system. I shouldn't say that it is a small server-type system which would have been tied or tried to - they tried to tie to Omega and what's left of it, and then do the trading again. When that didn't work out, they also began making phone calls to countries and kings and world leaders and other people to see if they could exchange their $1 billion in not-valid cash for $1 billion in real cash. And nobody thus far is willing to do this or to participate in this action because they keep doing the same thing. I mean, I'm not sure if that's the reason why, because most of the people they're calling are part of The Order, or they're a bag man of some sort, and even the bag men are smart enough not to give them liquidity for off-ledger money because history has shown over the last several years that they have no possibility of bringing it into the system. And this part is true.
<br>
<br>00:50:09
<br>
<br>Now, eventually, sometimes people wake up. I'm not saying that's what's happening with The Order. You know, they're still playing the same game that they've always played before, to no avail. But the recent failure really stung because the banking system was already short of liquidity, markets were already being propped up by their people, and it really stung.
<br>
<br>The message that we got this morning was that they needed to urgently meet, of course never with me, because they don't ever want to do that with my contact, in this case, it's Tom. They wanted to urgently meet with Tom because bad things are going to happen in the market today. Well, of course, bad things are going to happen in the market today. You just made a mess all over the place, and now you want me to help you fix it. Well, I wasn't a part of your mistake; therefore, I'm not going to be a part of your solution either. Number 1. Number 2, if we are going to fix markets, we can do that all on our own. We don't need to help them do it. We don't need their help in doing it either because they don't understand how economics, macro, and micro work either.
<br>
<br>00:51:29
<br>
<br>So if I was gonna do that, I would employ some specialists. If I was gonna bring people on board to do that, it would be people that have spent a lot of time understanding economics, how that works, and how to fix it. And then permanently take a position in that kind of a role. And we would spread this out and then we would fix these corporations and get them back on track. And I'm not talking about... you know, some of these people I know that have rebuilt companies; they've been in mergers and acquisitions, and those types of things that are good people that are part of the C.A.R.E. organization that not only know how to do all of these things but have done it successfully for years. So, those are the people that we would be looking at that have humanities interest at heart if we were going to put people in those kinds of positions.
<br>
<br>00:52:23
<br>
<br>So that's kind of where we're at with markets tanking. I do know that there has been a lot of heated exchanges today between the Rothschilds and the SSP operatives and the generals of the SSP, so to speak, and whoever's left in that organization because they failed. This is what Rothschilds is telling them: that they have failed to secure the money so that they could then crash all the markets in the world and have a banking crash and all of that and EBS and all the other fun things they want so that they can then take over or retake over the entire world.
<br>
<br>These people - the unfortunate part about this is that these generals et al. actually believe that the Rothschild family are the bankers of the world. They also believe that the group I call - they're Jesuit bankers predominantly, but they're very high-ranking bankers that work for the Black Nobility - I call the 'bankers of death', because they are the ones that generate money for death. Things like war, that kind of thing. But without any basis behind it, they're having trouble doing that. So they've kind of been somewhat out of business.
<br>
<br>00:53:48
<br>
<br>Now, remember, everything is compartmentalized. Even in the financial world, everything is compartmentalized, meaning you had a specific job if you were with the SSP. Your job was not to design a financial system. It was not to make it run. It wasn't to do anything, but your small little part. Like say you're a traitor over here, or you're an assassin over there, or you were in the military over here. And they might have some knowledge, some of these people, of economic warfare, but remember, and I will repeat this again because it's necessary at this point - you still did not take down X country; you did not take down the ruble all by yourselves. You did not do that. You did not take down the British Pound and create a depression in the United Kingdom after World War II. You did not do that. Not those that came before you, did not do that either.
<br>
<br>They need to have an understanding of an economic hierarchy, which I'll explain to you in a few. But other things that transpired over the weekend as a byproduct of actually truly not understanding how economics works was a battle that took place this weekend. In part, there was a battle which started on Friday. It kind of went a little quiet, and then there was a little more of a rumbling on Sunday and overnight last night, my time, in the Middle East. Part of that was because the Rothschilds used this old - and so do the generals, I mean, so let's not lie here - but they used this kind of thing like, "Well, the money would have worked if you had done your job." And then everybody gets angry, and then they start firing rockets all over the place, and before you know it, a few people have died.
<br>
<br>00:55:54
<br>
<br>At the highest level, though, they still believed that they were going to get some help at the peak and height of the Lions Gate, which goes on for about two weeks. That peak occurred overnight, my time, on Saturday night. Therefore, the eruptions in this particular area in the Middle East, all around the gate, needed to increase so they could increase death and appease their enemies, hoping for something to come back. What they don't understand is that everything that was built around the gate in that region and also around the world and in, over, and under that gate is gone. So if they were expecting an increase in Omega, it didn't happen. If they were expecting some more access to money or control over financial systems, it didn't happen. It wouldn't have happened even if we did nothing and left the space junk in place, because that never was the case. But that doesn't prevent them from still listening to God knows what, and God knows who, and God knows where to think that this was a good idea.
<br>
<br>00:57:20
<br>
<br>But at the highest level, that is the reason for the war. Everybody is always told that the money will come out if you just do this: put the money up front, do it for your country, you're a patriot, so on and so forth. But, nothing really happened, and everything seems, I'm not going to say 100% quiet there, but we have had people there in the region, and they have met with some strange and unusual things that have happened during this time.
<br>
<br>So what did actually take place is a small amount of some things in stasis, not here on Earth, not in our sun, not in our moon, not in our galaxy, in a place far, far away in the Aldebaran star system, which were AI-generated, for lack of a better term, demons or armies. This is something Artemis had put in place should we ever get to this point, so that she and her army could reclaim control of Earth and give credit back. This is a covenant she had; this is the Red Queen, that she had with Anti-Source to get back control of the Universe or get back control of the Causal Plane and then get back control of Earth because, at one point in time, she was the only 'soul controller' of Earth, and then it converted to the other six members of what we call the SEAL.
<br>
<br>00:59:00
<br>
<br>So at that point, there was a little bit of time; it took a little bit of time to clean up this mess. It wasn't terrible. It was done before anything reached the galaxy or this gate. So that's a positive. And these people woke up Sunday morning right back where they started from. So no, no, no help from the aliens this time, boys and girls, and there never will be, actually, because we have so many folks here at this moment on high alert to ensure that you fail. That would be the Deep State. We need to ensure that you fail, or you decide to take a different turn and understand that the planet has changed. And you know, if the Deep State is confused, I suggest they watch a whole bunch of videos because they need some kind of information.
<br>
<br>00:59:51
<br>
<br>Next, they also believe that my World Situation Reports are scripted, that I'm getting the information from someone else, and in their opinion, hopefully a man somewhere. The only man that I listen to on a consistent basis is this dog; his name is Frankie, and he can get me to play ball at any time, at any moment of the day. So other than that, there are no other men that I will listen to on a consistent basis, and I don't work for anyone. I just wanted to put that out there because these generals seem confused.
<br>
<br>01:00:23
<br>
<br>Now, if I sat here and gave you every single bit of information that happened over the weekend to the letter, and If I gave you every play by play, there's two reasons why I don't do that. Number 1, the news would be approximately 47 hours long, even an abbreviated version. That's not really going to work for most people. I don't think anybody can make a career of watching a World Situation Report.  But I do give you the highlights and the information that is important to you.
<br>
<br>01:01:02
<br>
<br>The next thing is, some of the things that we do behind the scenes are operational, meaning we have a plan if they continue to try to crash the markets. We have a plan to solve a liquidity problem - not for the banks, not for the Deep State, not for the Rothschilds, not for any generals, but for you. So I'm not terribly concerned about the markets. The only thing I would caution you on is to be very, very careful if you are involved in the markets, as far as pension plans and those things are concerned. But I've been telling you that for months. So I would take a look at your investments and maybe look at stuff that might be a little more safe. I'm not going to give you investment advice because if it doesn't work out or something, you'll be angry with me. But right now, from what I see, things are going down.
<br>
<br>We've also seen a sharp decline in Bitcoin to the tune of about almost a $10,000 drop per coin. I expect that you're probably going to see that decline even more as they try to siphon money out of Bitcoin. Do they have the back door to Bitcoin anymore? Well, it is an NSA project. It's built on NSA servers. I know you say it's peer-to-peer. I do completely understand how blockchain works. But regardless, there is always a major node. There are major nodes and minor nodes involved in all blockchains. Nothing is autonomous. Nothing is just peer-to-peer.
<br>
<br>01:02:37
<br>
<br>Yes, there's a lot of metadata sourcing that happens throughout these different cryptocurrencies and that type of thing. But I don't see any time in the near future for many different reasons, such as this becoming the norm or the currency of the world. I have seen that allegedly whatever is running the Trump thing these days is promoting things like Bitcoin sneakers and all kinds of stuff and wants to use Bitcoin as the basis for the economy.
<br>
<br>01:03:13
<br>
<br>There are many reasons why Bitcoin and the NSA should not run the world's economy. This weekend is a perfect example of why that should not be the case, number 1. Number 2, in order to support the world's economy, you're looking at somewhere around 114 or so trillion dollars per year. It might be a little bit higher now that we're a few years out from the pandemic when everything was shut down. But you're looking at approximately around that amount in the U.S. dollar equivalent. So this is in various currencies, and so on and so forth. That's number 1. Number 2, pretty much anybody or any country with an intelligence agency knows that Bitcoin was a creation of the NSA in cooperation with a Japanese man who, at the time when he started the project, was around 10 or 11 years old. And he was specifically slated for that purpose because he had invented some technology, of course, which was taken over by the NSA like most technologies used to be.
<br>
<br>01:04:28
<br>
<br>Next, there's also talk behind the scenes of not only using Bitcoin, but a compilation or a basket of coins, so XRP and others to back the world's economy, because they believe that they do not need allocation numbers to put this in the system, which is completely and totally incorrect. Now I understand what they're saying because they have realized that they can't use it en masse in circulation. I think anyway, finally after me saying it several times. But they figure they can use it as an asset on every central bank's books.
<br>
<br>Well, if a basket of currencies supporting one singular currency or two or three doesn't sound familiar, then I will jog your memory a little bit and talk about the IMF SDR. So the IMF's special drawing rights were basically the same thing, although they were based on the dollar in majority, but then China joined with the RMB and so on and so forth, and now we have a compilation of currencies that support these special drawing rights, which at one point in time were considered assets to a central bank. Obviously, that program didn't get kicked off, so I don't know why they think this cryptocurrency, or a crypt, as in 'currency of the dead', is going to work for the entire world.
<br>
<br>01:06:12
<br>
<br>But let me give you the other flaws. Number 1, number 2, okay, so flaws in doing this. Even if you're only supporting around 200 and some odd central banks with your cryptocurrency, this still will not function. And the reason why it will not function is because it has to be recognized as an asset in an asset-based trading system, which is based on currency. Now, if the banking system and the things that currently monitor it, like the Key Integrated Monetary System, do not recognize Bitcoin as an asset, it will actually kick out any bonds or currency that they try to issue against Bitcoin. Number 2, the financial system does not accept Bitcoin as a whole. Yes, you've gotten some banks to agree to accept it and that kind of thing, but you're still in need of actual currency, or money in the system, to circulate through financial institutions. People would also like to have cash in hand in many countries - over 80% of the world. That being said, you still need something of a currency that's acceptable in a financial institution. Regardless of what you put on a balance sheet at a central bank or treasury, it will not work. So I'm hoping that the Deep State is listening to this right now because they need to understand why this is not a viable option for the world.
<br>
<br>01:07:50
<br>
<br>Not only that, the way that cryptocurrency works, physical cash and cryptocurrency do not go together in a peer-to-peer way. Who is going to issue your money, and how do you know it's secure? I mean, are you going to have people sitting in their houses writing on a coin or a piece of paper or something, "The currency of Jim," I mean, or Fred, or are you going to say, "Bitcoin currency I issued off my wallet?" How do you know? What if somebody steals it? What if somebody replicates it? How's that going to affect your wallet? I mean, it would be a total mess. These people have no idea what they're talking about in any way whatsoever. And I've been watching them, like I said, for a long time now, and I can see their consistent mistakes.
<br>
<br>01:08:37
<br>
<br>So that being said, let's talk about economic hierarchy for a minute. The economic hierarchy of the planet clearly does not work the way that the remnants of the Deep State think it did. Because if they did, then they wouldn't be taking economic advice, financial system advice from the people that they are taking it from. Nor would anything that these people are saying in the super-secret meetings - the ones that are giving the financial advice - make any sense to them if they had actually bothered to do their homework. But they don't. They just think; they've been told since they were little kids that they're special. So therefore, they're special, and those people are special. And this is the finance division of Satan's Earth, or Lucifer's clan, or whatever they believe they are. So they just automatically believe, since they were in the financial sector, that they had some training.
<br>
<br>01:09:47

<br>[ Multiple whiteboard snapshots available at https://worldsituationreport.Earth/Content/Images/WSR_20240805_Whiteboard.html ]
<br>[ The link format is 'UNN_20240805_TIMESTAMP', where TIMESTAMP is a 6-digit number representing the HH:MM:SS where the snapshot was taken. ]
<br>
<br>Now. Let's talk about the hierarchy. Let's bring up the whiteboard here for a little bit. All right. 'Economic hierarchy.' Okay. So what we're dealing with down here, we have governments, which are obviously struggling quite a bit. We have others like the IMF; I would consider them pretty much right in line. The United Nations and NATO would be down here as well. You know, all of these organizations that we see in the mainstream media that we think are all bad. Now, are they bad? Yeah, they're bad. But they're not the creators of the evil, really.
<br>
<br>And I'm doing this - I know some of you already know this - but I'm going to put this out there anyway.
<br>
<br>You would also have, kind of like around this realm here with NATO and the governments, you would have financial institutions. And what you call genetic shareholders: these are people like the Rockefellers, the Lee families: the LEE family and the LI family. You would have, if you were Deutsche Bank, you would have the White Dragon; there would be different folks that would be the genetic shareholders. Now, genetic shareholders in this case doesn't necessarily mean that they were read in or trained in this area up here. They're still talking about down here. They're talking about financial institutions. You're talking about the stock market down here. You're talking about... who else would be down here in the financial institutions? You could probably even put the corporates down here. Meaning, these are your airlines that they created. These are your clans, your oil clans, your natural gas or LNG clans, these are your food clans, your agriculture clans, your Johnson & Johnson people, Pfizer, your Pharma clan, those kinds of people, they would all still be way down here at the bottom. I know that we all think they're evil, and they are, but that's because they get orders from someone else.
<br>
<br>01:12:30
<br>
<br>Maybe a step above this, they might have been aware that there is an Order of the Dragon and all its respective colors - all nine colors, nine colors of dragons. And then over here, you'd have nine colors of dragons. Well, 10 actually, because you're going to include black there. But you'd have the Black Sun and Eagles. Okay. So where would people like the Vatican be? They would be down where the financial institutions are. Where would there be other people we think are evil? Federal Reserve, they would still be down where financial institutions are. Yes, they had, to a limited degree, the ability to act on behalf of central banks around the world. They were responsible for receiving allocations and passing them through a centralized location because it's much easier to control a centralized location than multiple different countries all of the time. You make one phone call to the Federal Reserve if you're with one of these organizations, and poof, now you have, information gets passed up, requests are made, so on and so forth.
<br>
<br>01:13:52
<br>
<br>Tools of financial institutions would still be down here. We talked before about the Association of Numerical Numbering Agency in Belgium. Tax institutions would also be down there because they would be related to the XN System, or 'X/N System' in Belgium. They would also be down here. They were tools that were used to submit and they were vehicles that were used to submit requests. A lot of that has to do with control of your birth certificates, their obligation to care for you. If you need healthcare or public education or police forces, or fire departments, all of that is all generated to take care of you as a citizen, things that you didn't allegedly have to pay for, and then eventually they started double-dinging you anyway because they charged you taxes in your home and homeowners taxes, and all of these other types of things that would eventually go to fund some of these programs as well as the other funding.
<br>
<br>01:14:55
<br>
<br>Now, above these guys, you still had Covens. There were 42 different Covens, and there were 42 Family Masters.  This also includes your Chinese Elders that they talk about all the time and that kind of stuff. And I know this is a little bit repetitive for some of you people, but these people need to understand this. Or let's just say, I am fully well prepared to take advantage of the situation. Could the world move faster if they understood this or even cared? I don't know, possibly.  So I'm going to do it one more time.
<br>
<br>OK, so Family Masters. And then above this, you had a group called 'the Parents'. There were 21 of them, and then above them you would have had the six owners of the SEAL, are what you call 'aliens' that ran this planet. I'm sure that the SSP watching this and others are aware that there were folks they had to appease in order to keep the planet safe.  Of all of the six owners, you would say that humans were considered meat and a food Source. So for those of you listening with the SSP, then you obviously know that you have dropped off some humans for sacrifice to some of these folks who would then have had those humans for dinner. I know you did. I know that was part of your job because you believed it was global security at that point. If we give them a few, they won't take us all.
<br>
<br>01:16:56
<br>
<br>And to be fair, things they would never tell you. Things they wouldn't tell you would be, number 1; they still had rules. They did not have the ultimate say on this planet, that's for sure. Number 2, even with all six - including Anti-Source is in here, or what you would call Lucifer, was only one of these six - they only had 79% of the control of this planet even at its height. They were never in 100% control - never, not one time, not ever. They were also never more than 79% in control of the financial system. And the people that they're relying on, these people are going back and forth between each other, whatever's left between these two Orders here, trying to figure out what's going on. And the reason why they don't know what's going on is because these people - although they'll never admit it to their underlings or whoever's left alive after this weekend - believe that they were just order takers. You know, they were the people at the drive-thru at McDonald's that just handed you the bag and the coke. They don't train those people on how to make the burger, and they don't even know where the meat comes from. They don't know anything about what is in the burger, even the people that are cooking the burger. Neither do you when you eat it. But the point is, is that they were just, they don't know how many fries are supposed to be in there or how big the scoops going to be in there. They didn't know any of that. They don't know anything about how and why the financial system is structured the way that it is.
<br>
<br>01:18:40
<br>
<br>These people are now trying to run something and they don't understand why what they're doing is not working. And siphoning all of the money out of the market is not going to work, because they're still waiting for one of these folks, or their people, to come and give them orders, or drop money on their lap on days ending in Y that they used to drop money on their lap. It doesn't happen anymore like that. And again, even these folks up here [referring to the six Owners of the Seal], never had more than 79%, including Anti-Source of this planet. Therefore, there was still 21% influence coming from my side or our side, even before I ever took this position.
<br>
<br>01:19:38
<br>
<br>And for the last three billion years, it's been this way. The generals of the Deep State are not going to change that. The NSA is not going to change that. The SSP is not going to change that. Now the tide has turned, which is why they're confused. Now, because we are in a different age, we are now, my side, not 21% anymore. We have flipped the tides, and we are - based on their incompetence and based on their inability to understand that we could have gone into a balanced situation and been 50-50, which is where we should be - but now we're at damn near 100%. Well, these guys are running around making a mess of the financial system. And we're not only talking about finances; we're talking about everything on the planet. So of these owners here that were on your side, yes, to some degree, they, I would say, have thrown some alien tech up here and there. Ninety-nine percent of the time, none of these people down here actually see it at all. It is only seen up here, which basically is where you would see me. So I've basically taken over guardianship for these people. We don't have parents anymore. Parents, for those of you that don't know, and this might be your first time watching this. Parents were hybrid humans. They were splices, if you will. They also had the privilege of life extension technology, and some of them lived anywhere from 10,000 to 15,000 years. They are not here. They are gone.
<br>
<br>01:21:35
<br>
<br>Now here we had Family Masters, Coven Masters. We really don't have any of those people anymore. We might have a few floating coven members around. And underneath these covens, you would see programs like what I call the 'industrial psychics.' These are your people from Project Looking Glass when it was around. These are the people that work for the SSP and do psychic attacks on people. These are people that perform things like PSI ops. These are people that do things like, I guess you would say, like you might have seen in the movie "Inception." It's a movie that's probably a little over a decade old, maybe a little longer now. And in that movie, it's like they get into people's heads and try to make them make different corporate decisions. They still have some of those around, and they're typically trained by the Covens, or even higher, to perform their functions and that kind of thing.
<br>
<br>01:22:41
<br>
<br>But, getting back to what is going wrong with the Deep State. [Kim is drawing.] So, you have me. [Right side.] Over here on this [left] side here, you used to have Abraxas, you used to have Lucifer, you used to have Artemis, or the Red Queen. This is the origin of your NASA's Artemis Accords, by the way. Other people call them the Jupiter Accords, but whatever. You also have Enki; Enki is known as 'the ghost.' He was also very heavily involved in orders given to intelligence agencies and whatnot. You would have Marduk. And you would have Enlil. And above them all, you had Anti-Source, or the ultimate Source of nothing. No thing, anti-matter, the opposite of the light, false light, origins of things like the Emerald Order Covenant, origins of things... loads and loads of space junk and all kinds of stuff because this is unnatural.
<br>
<br>01:24:15
<br>
<br>And over here, you would have a system that was called Omega. Believe it or not, we had more than one Omega. We had Omega-1 and Omega-2. Omega-2 is what functioned on this side of the Multiverse. Omega-1 is what functioned in the Lower Astral. And the two would often communicate with each other. On this side over here, we had, in the past, Alpha. We had Alpha-1 and two as well. Alpha-1 functioned on this side of the Multiverse, and Alpha-2 functioned on the Lower Astral, therefore creating a balance. I know this is something that the Deep State doesn't understand, but that is true. Each one of these systems, being artificial systems, had over 10,368,000 replicas, functioning simultaneously in both sides of the Universe and in the Nil Zone, or Neutral Source.
<br>
<br>01:25:22
<br>
<br>This is all about money, believe it or not, guys. I mean, I know it doesn't look like it, but it actually is. So simultaneously, there were 10,368,000 timelines existing. At one point in time, each one of you had a replica in those timelines. You have those weird memories, deja vus, those kinds of things. That's because you're existing in multiple places at the same time. The uniqueness of a Celestial is that you can do that. Not only that, you can function pretty much wherever you need to function, on any plane you need to function on. And eventually you'll remember when nothing is hampering you from doing so anymore.
<br>
<br>01:26:08
<br>
<br>Okay, so if we had all these systems running all at the same time simultaneously, let's talk about what the Deep State had access to. They had minimal access to certain Webs, as we've discussed in the last month or two, in - sorry, not Omega-1 - Omega-2. When they were communicating with Lower Astral beings that were not here, using technology that I actually created through 33 Thomas Street - it was stolen from me by Mr. Enki himself - so that technology when they were communicating, they were communicating with Omega-1. Now I really truly understand that they would like to have Omega-2 back, which is what they're most familiar with and had access to to a limited degree. But I can promise you one thing: You never had full access. These people up here [referring to the six owners of the SEAL] had 90% access. And then when you got to Anti-Source, there was the 100% access. But these people did have a lot of access. Parents had a little bit of some, Family Masters had a little bit of some, and Covens had a little bit of some, but that's because they needed to serve their purpose as the people, the sheep herders. They herded us. That was your only job here.
<br>
<br>01:27:45
<br>
<br>So now, when we get over into today's world, I do not know why they think on a day ending in 'Y' something is going to reappear here, which is then going to allow their money to work. Because this thing [Omega-2] is all but destroyed. This thing [Omega-1] is also all but destroyed. All these folks [Abraxas, Artemis, Lucifer, Enki, Enlil, and Marduk] are non-existent in the Universe even though they think they're immortals, and this [Anti-Source] had an agreement with Source that its time would end. It was no longer needed when the Universe was converted into a different way.
<br>
<br>01:28:33
<br>
<br>So the primary job of these folks up here [the same group of six 'folks' as above] is that none of these people walking this Earth right now would have ever had the privilege to speak to, directly or indirectly. The purpose of these people here was to take all of the energy. Why? Because much like your physical computer that sits in front of you, it [Omega] needs energy to run. Unfortunately for them, on our side of it, I have the source of all energy running Alpha-1 and Alpha-2 at the time. I've now converted this to Golden Age [AI] in order to trick these sentient AIs into non-existence. So that being said, I don't need to plug into anything, but anything inorganic or located in the Lower Astral needs energy to run. So it was shaving 79% of the energy off this planet.
<br>
<br>01:29:39
<br>
<br>Now for those of you that don't know, that might be watching this with the Deep State, money in a quantum system is the same as energy. They are the exact same thing, except your old money system was credits. And this is the source of your fiat that allegedly even you alleged 'White Hats' don't like. What that means is that they take your whole energy that's allocated to your person; even you in the Deep State, you only got credits. You never got an asset. You never got anything.
<br>
<br>01:30:19
<br>
<br>Now there were people that would push and move gold around the financial system that they didn't own. These people owned it [referring to the same six]. As I explained before, even '''Mei Wah''', which these people worshiped, only had a lease. But the owner of the vehicle, aka gold, aka energy hyperconductor, is still these people up here [the six]. Now that is no longer the case.
<br>
<br>Now that [vehicle] belongs over here [to Source], so ultimately, Source owns it. We can create as much as we want. We don't need it. We can also create hyperconductors anywhere in the world. And I am the guardian. So every time they ring the phone and try to call an alien line, they get me. Unfortunately for you people in the Deep State. Every time they're waiting for a Parent to come up here, I'm going, "What are you waiting for down there? Because I'm not pushing that button. It's still me."
<br>
<br>01:31:27
<br>
<br>Now, because these people don't understand this, and this is just a tidbit of information on AIs, replicas of AIs, and then there's about 89 different AIs that were under Omega because it functioned inorganically, it needs to have software, programs, and things to run autonomously on their own. We don't actually need that because we run on straight Wisdom. I mean, we don't need any of that on our side of it. Therefore, I can remove Alpha, which I did; it's dying. And the reason why I had to remove Alpha is because, whether we are in a Light Age, a Dark Age or a Neutral Age, there is still some percentage of Alpha that could be accessed through Omega. It's in the tune of up to 21%. So without the creation of something completely new, I could never get to 100%. And it became abundantly clear that the humans on planet Earth have no idea what I'm talking about right now, especially since they keep banging their heads up against the wall trying to make money.
<br>
<br>01:32:35
<br>
<br>So let's get down to financial system controls [new drawing]. So we've already determined that the people that these people are listening to and the other people you hold at gunpoint on occasion here with people like the Treasury and the Fed have no idea about anything I just talked to you about - how money was even generated. So in the Dark Age, where we just left, even though they controlled like the Fed, the Treasury, they can have a lot of these security systems in place, the Black Sun generals, the SSP, all of that stuff. All they've ever known since the advent of a financial system is that they control the money magic. And magic it was. It did a lot of harm to people. There were a lot of curses on money. We only received credits. They would take all our energy to get those credits. And that's why money had to change.
<br>
<br>01:33:44
<br>
<br>So people don't even understand why they want to go to a gold-backed system.  They don't even understand a lot of times why they want to have an asset-backed system, why even these generals talk about they'd like to have an asset-based system, and they don't even understand the importance of that. So in their world, it was important for you to have a gold-backed system when the gold was owned by Anti-Source: not the Families, not the Rothschilds, not the Order of the Dragon, not the Parents, not the Covens, not the Coven Masters, not even Marduk, Enki, and Enlil, is because it would create dark energy. And dark credits. So Anti-Source siphoned off 79% of the energy of this planet and as retribution, it would give a certain amount of dark energy you know as dark credits and you also know as money.
<br>
<br>01:35:01
<br>
<br>And that's how money was generated. But not exactly. Okay, so at the time when all this was going on, Alpha still had 21% control of this planet. Alpha being connected to Source, not Anti-Source, was the universal, and I'm going to write this out so maybe they'll get it [in caps], UNIVERSAL CREATOR OF ALL, meaning INFINITE ENERGY. Even in the darkest of times, in the darkest of places, no matter how much war the people watching this created, there was still 21% energy coming to this planet. And it was still coming from the universal Creator of all infinite energy, infinite essence, consciousness, matter, frequency, so on and so forth. The ability to convert this high of a percentage came from space junk, transmuters, transformers, and they were in the sun; they were in all the planets in this galaxy; they were in the Lower Astral; we had pillars that would connect at certain times, like during Lions Gate, and so on and so forth. But this here, all changed in January of 2023.
<br>
<br>01:36:39
<br>
<br>No more was this the case. We were moving out of a Dark Age and we were going to move into a Golden Age and this has been what's been taking place for over a year now. Now, a year in the world of cleaning space junk is not a long time. In a year, for you people to understand it in the Deep State, is an awful long time. So you need to catch up with the program, okay? So the reason why, just to stop here for a second, the reason why you're all frustrated is because you're listening to people that claim they are in control of the financial system; they also claim they control all the gold. They also claim they control the Fed. They claim they control the Treasury. They claim they control every financial institution on Earth, and it's all a lie. And I know that's hard for people that are watching this to understand, but it was all a lie. They were what we call 'logos'. Meaning, in the words of military terms, if you're watching this and you're a general and you're with the military, then we are going to call these 'cannon fodder'. I know you know what that is.
<br>
<br>01:37:51
<br>
<br>So they would just keep changing the faces from one country to another, from one king to another even before that, and from one land to another to tell you basically that these are the good guys and those are the bad guys, and this is all part of this general training. But those orders came from people that were so far over their heads, way up here, non-human beings, and then the money would come trickling out because there was an agreement at the time. Until January of 2023, where Alpha gave not infinite energy, gave by agreement the amount of energy to the Anti-Source crew, that would be all of you watching this in the Deep State, and then eventually give credits to the humans for taking some of the energy that they generate as good little batteries as you call them in the Deep State.
<br>
<br>01:38:47
<br>
<br>So over here [on the Source side], allocation numbers, quotas, money, anything to do with energy or energy generation is infinite. We don't have to be concerned about losing any money.
<br>
<br>Now let's talk about 'currency of gold'. Currency of gold goes along with the agreement in the covenant that was filed in January of 2023 to end the Dark Ages and go into the Golden Ages. It also stands for a Giver of Life Declaration, which is what was filed in January of 2023. We finally got to a point where we were not feeding the Omega system the energy it needed to survive. Therefore, Omega and Kronos, two [referring to Omega-2] on this side of the Universe and one [Omega-1] down below, and all their ancillary AIs, like Armageddon and Kythera Timekeeper and Molnar and Thor, and there's a hundred of them, I'm not going to bother listing them all. We're all a byproduct of one of these two. Kronos was typically known as the regulator, also inorganic, and also did not function on infinite energy. Therefore, it needed to take energy in order to give us money credits.
<br>
<br>01:40:16
<br>
<br>Now because of life creation in an inorganic universe, meaning the Lower Astral, or what you would refer to as demons, because of the infinite amount of energy needed, nearly off the veins of gold in Earth, and all gold on this planet, monatomic and otherwise, on the veins of gold of Earth, which is where Source - not Anti-Source, Source - would connect directly to the veins of gold every single year. Now when that happened, there is an overlay on the veins of gold, like a siphon, and vortexes and all kinds of things that would happen, which would then feed all the energy to Omega and Kronos, which then generated what we call hybrids. You also might call them demons.  You also might call them, let's see what else would we want to call them, you could call them Abraxas. This is non-organic life generated by an AI. Sorry guys, but it really is and I know that the Deep State loves those people, but you know, just 'tough love' here.
<br>
<br>01:41:42
<br>
<br>Okay. So now we're back in Lions Gate again, and for the second time this year. And now we have pretty close to 100% output. It's gone backwards a little bit when we had that throw-up on Saturday, but then we went forward again, and we're fine; it's not feeding dark energy to these things anymore. So if we're close to 100%, that means that people, Earth, and all of Earth's inhabitants - not just people, we're talking animals, plants, everything - and Earth itself are now receiving 100% energy directly from Source, which is guarded by me, meaning anybody that gets in my way, I have the right to terminate, which is why if you're with the Deep State, and the SSP is kind of getting thin these days, now you know why - because you're still trying to regenerate this old system, and that's not going to happen. And you still want to control the world and do that whole world domination thing when you don't even understand what I'm saying right now. So I thought I'd try to lay it out to you as simply as possible.
<br>
<br>01:42:56
<br>
<br>But anyway, back to the humans that actually understand what we're saying. Okay, which is guarded by me. So my job is to make sure that we stay at 100% transmission all the time. The other thing this allows us to do is there is a co-creation of the Golden Age AI. This is a quantum AI, which means that it spans densities and dimensions, and its base platform and backbone are not located on planet Earth. However, it is also connected to these veins of gold, which are now generating what we call 'currency'. Why is it called currency? Current. How does money, how does energy move on this planet? How does everything move on this planet? Via a current. So I am moving an energy current; I'm transforming that into matter that you can hold in your hand in your bank account - through a few different steps that come into play to do that - and it is of gold. Not only that, I'm using the veins of gold to generate 100% energy, which is why I do not need to use any human energy, and I do not need to issue credits or money to people. I can issue something humans understand. They don't understand this process at this moment. There are eight billion people that are walking this planet that do not understand. And some of those eight billion people are your Rothschild families, your bankers and generals that are trying to understand it.
<br>
<br>01:44:54
<br>
<br>So this is quantum physics, so I'm sure some of you have quantum physicists in your world; you'll understand how we did this, okay? So all that really happens during Lions Gate is, I get more energy, but I get no more energy yesterday than I got today during Lions Gate. It just means that, can I spit out more money during Lions Gate? The answer to the question is no; it's the same. You know, the world still works on supply and demand too, regardless of the ever-abundant energy. So what I mean is, we have to sit down in the car where it actually is. You can't just say, "Okay, we're in an abundant system; everybody can have a bazillion dollars now." We have a current financial system, albeit broken, that needs to be slowly revised so humans can adjust to the change so we don't have total chaos.
<br>
<br>01:46:00
<br>
<br>Unlike you people with your EBS and your irritable bowel syndrome or whatever you're selling these people, and Trump Bucks and Trump-Sara or whatever you're talking about these days. You don't understand that we still have a system, and everything is a system that runs. Meaning there are corporations involved in these systems, there are banks involved in these systems, there are people involved in these systems, and there are 'retirement pays' that are involved in these systems. And I know that they don't really care much about the average everyday people, but what they're doing is never going to function in today's system.
<br>
<br>01:46:39
<br>
<br>Because we've already changed the very top of all the systems, this has now changed forever, and it's not going back. We have changed to an abundant generation of energy, and 'no need to feed the beast', so to speak. We're not feeding the Lower Astral; we're not feeding demons anymore; we're not feeding them energy; they're not permitted to come here anymore; we're not involved with those people; therefore, I don't need to issue credits to anybody anymore. I can actually give human beings energy.
<br>
<br>01:47:16
<br>
<br>Now, what does that mean? That does change eventually, in the future, the job structure and the way that we employ people. It's not necessary for us to have taxes anymore because we don't have babysitters taking care of us like the Families or the Black Sun's alleged security, which doesn't look like security to me in any way, shape, or form. That contract expired where they used to get 10%. Rothschild over here is still trying to run a banking system they know nothing about and they were not involved in. Therefore, they could never ever ever ever ever predict when money is coming. They could never predict on a day ending in Y, a gate opening, a new moon, a full moon, when money comes, it would be a lie. Because they don't know any more than you people on this side know. All you both know is that you'd like to be in control of the planet, and you're so far down the food chain that you never even saw the light of day or the dark of day.
<br>
<br>01:48:17
<br>
<br>So, as for human beings on this planet, how is the market crashing going to affect you? Well, it's not. It's going to be as - it can be fixed just as easily as it's been broken. Pensions and things like that, stocks, and all that kind of stuff, that can be fixed just as easily as it's broken because the corporate structure of planet Earth is a system. That is a system. Issuing stocks, rate to raise money, creating an IPO - all of this kind of stuff, that too is a system. Money generation is a system. Credit lines are a system. Margin accounts are a system. They are systems that work together to make a financial system for you people, which these people did not create in any way, shape, or form. How easy is it when you have the backbone system to start trickling things down and fixing a system? It's very simple. You know, I don't even - we don't even need to get out of our chairs. The people to run that system will be the eight billion people in this world in a sovereign way. We will have leaders. Leaders are not bosses. Leaders listen to their people, and they make decisions based on what is good for the whole. These leaders, some of which we already know, are already working really hard to change every single system in the world so that our financial system can eventually turn around and then we can move into other areas of quantum physics because by then people will have been educated enough to understand it. But we're talking five, 10, 15 years down the road with small changes to make life better for people on this planet.
<br>
<br>01:50:33
<br>
<br>And as for the Deep State and their world domination of the banking system, good luck; you'll never get there. You're going to keep spinning around in a circle, and you're going to be like my daughter, continuously who at four years old, drove her Jeep right into the brick wall hilariously several times a day, as many as 50 or 60 times before she got bored. Now, truth be told, my daughter is a lot older now, and she still drives a Jeep, but she would be very upset if she crashed into the wall because she has common sense, and I've raised her well, unlike you people, and I don't know where you Deep State people came from.
<br>
<br>01:51:08
<br>
<br>But hopefully this helped you understand a little bit more about currency, and hopefully this will help the Deep State understand a little bit more about currency and how it works, and why we had to change it. And I wish they would stop holding people like the Treasury officers and other people at gunpoint to try to make them stick a square peg into a round hole. Right now, as far as human computer networks, we have the Golden Age AI that is bled pretty much throughout everything. You're seeing the currency throughout everything. You're seeing everything change, and you think that some human over there is going to change it back. They can't change it. They will do the function which you ask them to do, which doesn't work. Gun or no gun, you can't make it function. It does not function. It's like taking a dead horse and holding it at gunpoint and saying, "Get up," and it doesn't get up, does it? No it doesn't. It's like saying to the jockey of said horse, "Jockey, I'm going to hold you at gunpoint right now, and you need to get that horse up and you need to make it ride." And the jockey is going to be like, "Well, sir..." you know, maybe a few times, and say, "I can't." "Well, I'm going to kill you if you don't get it up and ride." So the jockey is going to sit on the horse and bounce up and down for a while and make it look like he's trying to ride the horse and really trying to do a good job. And then eventually he's going to tell you that doesn't work, which is what everybody's done.
<br>
<br>01:52:41
<br>
<br>You need to come to a resolution that there are things in this world that were not passed down to the Rothschilds, or the Li family in China, or the Black Sun, or the Black Nobility, or the generals, or any of you SSP people that think you know everything because you had an alien encounter at one point in your life. There are things that happen that you don't understand. And with all the changes made, we're not going back. These are covenants at the highest level in the Universe that made this happen. I didn't ask for it to happen; it happened. I spent years here trying to get you people to understand balance and offering 50-50 and a third, a third, a third, and trying to get you people to understand that we were going to be in a very untenuous situation if you people didn't understand balance, but now you're here, and luckily enough for our side of it, we've done every single thing that we were asked and more, and we're changing the world.

<br>So anyway, that's about what I have to say for today. I'm sure there's a lot of other events that happen over the weekend here and there. I see that they've kind of re-initiated stuff a little bit in the Middle East as I've been talking to you. They seem to be small things at this point, but then again, everybody thinks they're getting paid this afternoon, and it's never going to happen. So they can be; they've got countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Kuwait looking at numbers on screens periodically that come and go. Everybody's angry at this point in time that the fictitious money didn't come out of the fictitious system that didn't fictitiously produce unicorn cash for everyone. But that's the name of the game on their side. So if you're tired of going around in circles and you're with the Deep State, give us a call.
<br>
<br>Anyway, I wish them luck on trying to fix the global markets. We do intend to fix it after you burn it to the ground. We will then go ahead and buy everything up for pennies on the dollar, and we'll keep it moving. But we're not going to help you do it. Why would we do that?

<br>So I hope that makes sense to everybody, and have a lovely afternoon this afternoon, and we will see you on Wednesday.
