            <br>Global Intelligence Agency (GIA)
            <br>Operations Report
            <br>2025-Jul-26
        </h2>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;"> From the Office of the Guardian </h4>
        <br>
        <strong>
        <br>[It's the 26th of July, 2025. Coming up on today's Global Intelligence Agency Operations] Report:
        </strong>
        <br>
        <br>Time is money, and money is time. The big business of time travel is dependent on loosh. And yes, it is all tied to the financial system, both on and off the planet.
        <br>
        <br>Then there is the circus we call politics, media, military, intelligence agencies, and projects. What is the purpose? And what is the agenda behind the agenda now?
        <br>
        <br>And more on what the ACIO, also known as the Advanced Alien Contact Intelligence Organization, or the Secret Space Force, or the Galactic Federation are doing behind the scenes, now that the empires they work for are falling.
        <br>

        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:01:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Well, it's the 26th of July, almost done with this month. I don't know; they say, "I can't wait for this day to be over," and I think to myself sometimes "I can't wait for this month to be over." We're at an interesting time, based on what the Space Force thinks and what everybody thinks is going to happen, and it's causing a lot of confusion out there for a lot of people.
        <br>
        <br>So I figured I'd start with and talk a little bit about the circus. That's what I call the media these days: the circus. I guess it's always been a circus, but it's getting pretty weak, really. You know, there are times where they make people appear weak, and there are times where they just don't know what they're doing. And it appears to me that at this moment they don't know what they're doing.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:02:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But I want to caution you about a few things. Sometimes, when they say things or put a lot of emphasis on things in the media, you know, so you'll put emphasis on it and therefore help it come into being, so to speak. And again, I keep repeating this, but you have no idea how powerful humans are, and you're becoming more and more into your own power every day. And the more we go through all of these changes, the more of a... the more they need us more than we need them. I mean, we never needed them in any way, shape, or form - but they think we do.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:03:08</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And what a show this week. And I apologize for not getting a report out earlier. It's just I've been really working hard for the last 10 days - really hard - but the last few days it's been very long days of empires, kingdoms, frequencies, portals, and to be fair, there were some moments of, "Aha! Oh my gosh, this makes so much more sense to me now - why they do this." And in other times I'm like, "What's this?" So I'm going to share all those - the good and the bad and the ugly - with you today and let you know kind of where we're at on our end of it, based on the last report.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:03:55</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So just to give you kind of an update, this media show continues. And there's a lot of people talking about this Trump-Powell meeting in the basement of the Fed building, and why that would happen and why (allegedly) the Fed is renovating the basement. Well, earlier this week - a few days ago - they did try to install the FedNow system again. And it came to my attention that - as we discussed in our last report - that there are empires and kingdoms and federations and colonies and estates, and all kinds of different parts of these grids on the planet.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:04:43</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So when people talk about a planetary grid, pretty much every grid we've ever had is not natural. In the natural world of things, we do not have grids. But the grids are power centers. Almost all grids are tied - and empires and kingdoms and federations - are tied to AI systems. And as far as the humans on this planet, they would like to get ahold of those AI systems. So the former old Omega, for example, financial system, Black Level 9 Screen systems, and White Screen systems - they would love to get their hands on that. And they're having a little bit of a problem doing that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:05:35</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, the ACIO had their own systems, as part of planetary defense, reporting directly to Marduk, Enki, and Enlil. So they would like their AI systems - this was a few days ago because the world is a changing place - they would like what remaining AI systems they had to be able to connect to the global financial system. They feel connecting to the global financial system at the highest level is of the utmost importance for them at this moment.
        <br>
        <br>And I would say Marduk thought that controlling the financial system of the planet (and creating one) was one of his greatest inventions for a reason.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:06:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now as it relates to this Trump and Powell - Powell's in; Powell's out; Powell resigned; Powell didn't resign - I mean, I've been seeing it everywhere, so I thought I would address it. A lot of this has to do with, quote-unquote, the Color Wars. This is the wars between groups of humans - mainly of the ACIO, also known as the SSP, or Secret Space Force, also known as the Galactic Federation - they go by many names. You could say that some of them feel they are working for the Light. Therefore, you have people reporting about the Light system - the TLS or whatever - that's where that comes into play. And they pretty much... none of them are doing anything positive for us, I can tell you that. It just depends on which side and which color and whatnot that they've worked for.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:07:15</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But in the basement, underneath the Fed, and underneath all major Tier One financial institutions to a lesser degree, and then of course in Silverton, Colorado, and in Mercury - planet Mercury, that is - and a few other locations, there is a master, or was an empire, for energy management and also looshing management. And all of these things were connected to what you call the Federal Reserve. To a lesser degree, you have the Treasury, but also, I would say - maybe not in the financial world were they equally important for a long time - but in the world of omniversal structures, I would say that they played a significant role.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:08:13</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And at this point in time, they have been unsuccessful in gaining any kind of access to any kind of financial systems - although they would really like to. They've tried to do that from the top down, the bottom up, the middle in, the middle out, the left and right - whichever way they could possibly try to get in. Maybe they can get in through red lines or blue lines or orange lines or green lines or whatever lines, and they've been trying to do everything they can to get into one of these systems.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:08:54</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And if you think of planetary grids, sometimes they do intertwine. You know, they look almost like a woven pattern. Sometimes those planetary grid systems are on top of one another, and sometimes they overlay one another - one is more important than the other. In this particular case, they believed that if they got Powell and Powell's superiors on their side, that they could get access to something that they felt was special in the basement of the Federal Reserves.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:09:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And by Federal Reserves, there is a network, or was a network, of Federal and/or Reserve Banks. You remember the Bank of England was a Reserve Bank. The Federal Reserve we know about, and the 12 of those here in the United States. But also the Australian Reserve Bank is a part of the Reserve System. You have Development Bank of Singapore, the World Bank, the IMF, the EXIM Bank. You also have the Development Bank of South Africa and the Reserve Bank of South Africa. So there are many other reserve banks in the world, not just the Fed, but they are all part of the Fed's network, so to speak.
        <br>
        <br>And they had been unsuccessful in trying to get into this system, which they really would like to control. So they made an attempt to go into the basement of the Fed and try their hand, literally, at accessing the system.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:10:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, in order to access the system... and it requires more than just a human. Always has. You know, on some lesser level, in the basements of the Fed, there are some very odd-looking - for lack of a better term, "computer systems" - which transmit data, and databases, and those kind of things. They do not look like our computer systems. And to a lesser degree, there was an interface there, which the chairman of the Fed would be able to use - or chairmen of the various 12 Feds. Now, that was nothing more than a place where you could transmit information in and out. You could send liens and bonds through, and new money would come back out.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:11:38</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>There was a connection to the system to the Association of Numerical Numbering Agency. Also to Bern, Switzerland, and Brussels, where the ANNA is and the X/N is. So it was more complicated than I believe they thought. The Bank for International Settlements was also on the network. But they thought that if they got access to this particular room that they figured Powell has access to, that something would happen for them.
        <br>
        <br>And they did try - all day, I think it was Thursday - they tried all day trying to connect something to that system unsuccessfully. And then all of a sudden the system disappeared. Now what are they gonna do?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:12:28</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>There is a lot of shuffling going on on that level between the Treasury and the Fed. The Federal Reserve has ACIO employees, and so does the Treasury. And right now they are trying to move Federal Reserve employees to the Treasury. Why? I don't know. I think maybe they think the Treasury system would be better. And this shuffle has been going on for probably 10 days or more.
        <br>
        <br>More significantly, we're seeing this over the last 3 or 4 days, within our country and within the USA. What happens here still happens everywhere, at this moment in time, based on the base of operations of the ACIOs, plural. The end result is, well, there really isn't a whole lot left there, as it relates to the old financial systems.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:13:34</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, we have been installing our own as we take out these things, meaning our own - that means ours, as Humanity, and Source. We are not interested in regurgitating any of their systems in any way, shape, or form. And as far as I'm concerned, Source is the only Kingdom, the Empire, the Boss, the Head Honcho, so to speak, of everything - and should be - of all Creation.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:14:06</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, you know, a lot of what we're seeing play out is just nothing more than that. I do have some friends over in the UK who have reported that Trump is visiting there - I think it's today or yesterday - and did not meet with a warm welcome. He was supposed to go there golfing at his golf resorts in, I think it's Scotland. And unfortunately... well, apparently, all the resorts were vandalized. It's in their national news there in the UK that he is a convicted felon, and all of this kind of thing. And it's just all part of the show, really; it's just a fight between one group to another.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:14:52</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>They are... because there has been no luck getting Trump to transfer money, like the Trump operatives have claimed he did this whole time - when it really wasn't him - that was us. But they're very angry. There's a lot of angry operatives that are not getting paid. They would like to have a regime change. They would like to put somebody else in there, and see if maybe they could give it a go. But it doesn't matter who they put in there at this point in time - it's really not going to change anything.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:15:26</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>This show - and it is a show - about releasing the Epstein files: be careful with this one, because of what we are hearing that they would like to do behind the scenes. So Epstein is the name of a person, and we hadn't heard anything about it in quite a long time - it's been a number of years since he allegedly committed suicide and, you know, moved somewhere else.
        <br>
        <br>But when a lot of people focus on wanting to see the files, they want the files - remember - and I'm just here to remind you that "Epstein" is also the name of a virus, called "Epstein-Barr" mononucleosis by another name. It's also behind the long COVID virus.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:16:27</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So it is a herpes virus. It is one that was created and manufactured by the same programs and people that keep pushing this name out there. I can't quite figure out why they keep pushing these files and dangling the carrot in front of all the people that want to know and want to see the files. I'm wondering if when you say, "I really want to see those files," what you're saying is, "I would like to have some of that virus."
        <br>
        <br>Remember, most of these viruses - almost all viruses and parasites - are not natural. They are generated by AI systems, for lack of a better term. And usually, these things are perpetuated, and I'm not even going to say controlled. I'm going to say accessible at certain times when it was permitted to perpetuate them throughout humanity by the ACIO. But still, they're having trouble manifesting or bringing these things to, let's just say, fruition.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:17:34</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And they've got some really big plans behind the scenes that I want to mention to you.
        <br>
        <br>And I caution you. When I tell you this, I'm telling you this because I want... when you start to focus on the news... you start to focus on things in the media... things that are popping up everywhere in social media - be it cancer, or there's all kinds of things that float around there - I want to caution you on where you put your focus.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:18:09</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>I also want to caution you about fear. Fear is "false evidence appearing real." It gets your adrenaline pumping, your cortisol pumping. It also allows for them to loosh you in a different way.
        <br>
        <br>Therefore, most of the programs that they have out there for social media - and there's a lot - I've seen all kinds of crap this week. Oh, here comes the Emergency Broadcast System - it's all going to happen now, you know - and nothing happens.
        <br>
        <br>I think another one of those days ending in Y is Monday, where they feel there's an alignment with, I think, Sedna or something, on Monday. And that's going to help them get something or do something. As far as we can tell, there's nothing really about to happen to help them in any way.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:19:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But the circus behind the scenes is all about human control. You see, we're getting increasingly difficult to control. And at a time when a lot of humanity is waking up, and they are starting to question things, and they are looking for information, and looking for what's really going on - and then getting angry about what's really going on.
        <br>
        <br>Behind the scenes, the ACIO's main goal right now - because that's pretty much where the majority of the influence comes from that's on this planet, at least as it relates to herding us cattle, so to speak, we call humans. Behind the scenes, they would like to have more control over your mind, body, soul, neurological systems, the amount of time you are on this planet - that type of thing. And they are really pushing hard for that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:20:08</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>They also would like to push hard to have you spend as much time as possible on electronic devices. Because their ability to influence you through the air, such as frequencies and those types of things, is becoming increasingly limited. Therefore, they have really been testing and pushing programs through electronics.
        <br>
        <br>Now, I encourage you, because of this, to spend as much time away from electronics as possible. I know we want to get the news, and we order things online these days and that kind of thing, and that's fine. But as necessary, let's just say.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:20:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And as far as the fear factors they're putting out there everywhere, or the anger factors, your consciousness is extremely important to them - what you think actually matters to them at this moment in time. It won't for much longer, but right now it does, and they think that if they can continuously push your consciousness in the direction that they would like, that they could possibly open a portal, or get some assistance from you.
        <br>
        <br>So the human control agenda is everything you've heard about. Megvii AI is one involved. The Barcode of Life Initiative is another. The other mechanisms behind the scenes for pharmaceuticals, poisoning water, air, all that type of thing. These are all part of an agenda that serves them.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:21:55</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Chemtrails are full of a substance they consider to be unknown, even when analyzed. They were "unknown" because it's dust. It's not something that we know of in our science, so analysis by scientists doesn't work.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:22:13</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>The ACIO has also employed a tremendous amount of scientists, at least anybody that can still work for them. And these scientists are different, very different. They are very science-focused. They do not have a whole lot of human in them.
        <br>
        <br>What I mean by that is: they are human, but they, you know, what does it mean to be human? You know, we love, we care. We definitely do not want to cause harm to another. Sometimes we think about that with the Deep State, but really our goal is not to cause harm - to care for each other, care for the planet. Sure, everybody has good days and bad days, but generally we're not killers.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:23:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>The scientists create what they're told to create. They're having a very difficult time doing so at this moment in time, but they don't have a whole lot of practical knowledge, or repercussions for their actions. They don't understand that - they just kind of do what they do and do what they're told. And not really even out of fear, it's just, "Okay, you need a weapon that kills 10 million people in one shot? Here you go, here it is."
        <br>
        <br>They don't really care about those people because they're not those people. They've never really been affected by these types of things, and they're told to be here or there. They don't mind opening portals - which they used to have the capacity to do for the Deep State, or for the ACIO. They don't mind doing that, even if it lets in Dark things. They're aware that Dark things come through there - they're just looking at it like it's a big science win, that they actually managed to do it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:24:13</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, that being said, it's been kind of a battle. As things disappear, they keep grasping at anything that's left before it goes away. I guess thinking that if they get ahold of it, get access to it, that they could use it before it goes away, control it, maybe? You know, what they don't realize is that if they did actually turn something on, it alerts us immediately, and then it makes it easier for us to find it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:24:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So a lot of these scientists have been both on- and off-planet as well. Meaning, they understand how the sophons and photons work, how that allows them to access things here and on other planets that we allegedly colonized, which I guess you could say we had. I wouldn't say humans colonized them - I would say they created human colonies, for a reason - in these locations.
        <br>
        <br>And it's all about, honestly, business. And I know, to us, all of this sounds horrific - and it is horrific. These agendas can be kind of scary, all of these projects. The Agenda 21s and all the other things you hear about - or what is it, 2030 now? I don't know. Information that comes out from the World Health Organization - that they're going to do this and they're going to do that - and then it kind of disappears from the media.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:25:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>You know, it really truly is a circus behind the scenes. And when you are watching them, like we do - 24 hours a day, seven days a week - you start to realize that they really, really are grasping at straws. Meaning, they do have access (and had access) to some knowledge that we didn't have - meaning humanity as a whole - and there were some technologies in there that could be used for a positive thing. But I wouldn't trust anything they gave me at this point.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:26:39</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But behind the scenes, they really don't know what they're doing. You know, as an example, they'll go to a location that is supposed to be an access portal for disease, let's just say. And they try to install a financial system into it - because they don't really know the difference between a grid, a grid, and a grid, and how they work. They try to communicate, you know, picking up a banana instead of a telephone.
        <br>
        <br>So, these are the things that they're doing behind the scenes. And I know it seems ominous, and it seems scary, and the more we watch what they're doing, the less scary it actually seems. It's really... it's going well on our side, let's put it that way.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:27:35</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So a few things that came up - that I found rather interesting - are more information about our financial system. Now we know that it's based on a much larger business, so to speak. In other words, yeah, there's money that comes and goes, and of course, as humans, they have designed the economic system of the planet to require us, basically, to have it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:28:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So we are required to willingly give our time to receive said money - whether you're owning your own business or you're working for someone else - even those that are on retirement, and collect Social Security or other government benefits, also put in a lot of time to receive those benefits. You worked your whole life to receive those Social Security benefits.
        <br>
        <br>So that being said, to gain a better understanding of why the one thing that everybody wants and has not gotten yet - on the Deep State side - is control of the financial system. Now, behind the scenes of the financial system, we know we give our energy too. We give energy willingly, and some of you could say that you put your heart and soul into your business or your job - you enjoy your job, and you put your heart and soul into it. So, we give a lot to get this money.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:29:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And this system, the economic system of Earth, actually benefits the looshing system. You see, because loosh, as we've talked about before... and it comes in many flavors, really. You know, it can be flavored with fear - it's like sprinkles on ice cream. It can be flavored with investiture, or royalty, or us looking to royalty or government. Presidents are considered... your country or prime minister is considered your country's quote-unquote royalty or head.
        <br>
        <br>Oftentimes the American president has been looked at as the leader of the free world [chuckle]. I laugh. But those give some flavors to the loosh. But the most important thing to understand about looshing is that it allows for Dark entities to time travel - and to travel, period.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:30:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>You see, as we've been working on the, let's call it "large portal," for lack of a better term, down the street in Silverton - we've discovered how it was created in our last report - but we've also discovered how and why. And understanding why gave us a better understanding of "Why loosh humans?"
        <br>
        <br>It actually gives time - but not directly. You see, we're willingly saying, "Here's my time; you can have it. I don't need it. Here, have my time. Give me the green papers - I need that." Or the blue and red papers, or wherever you are in the world - whatever color it is. But remember, it's all just a flavor.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:31:47</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, a lot of the abilities of the ACIO, Galactic Federation, the Draco, the Abraxas, and all of those we've named... Chimera, all the folks and species we've named, and some we haven't. In order for Dark beings to travel - now, when I say "time travel," I don't just mean forward and back in time, or from one timeline to another timeline, as it were. I mean travel from one density to another density, from one star system or galaxy to another galaxy. To travel anywhere you'd like to go throughout the Omniverse is done using - if you are a Dark being - it's done through time travel.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:32:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, before time existed - and there was a time before time existed here on Earth - most beings traveled back and forth through the Central Sun of Earth. The Central Sun of Earth - which then became the Stargate in the Sun - both had stargates, both were natural, and those stargates are created by opening a time-space-continuum opening... not time-space, I should say - that's the wrong way to say it. You are essentially creating a... you're taking a small particle, and you're expanding that particle, which then opens up - I wouldn't call it a sophon, and I wouldn't even call it a photon - you're basically walking into a particle of Source, is what you're doing.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:33:55</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And as we've said, Source is like a mainframe computer. And all of these little sparkles you see in the sky that are little bits of Source (and they, of course, exist within you) are the way to travel - it's the way to go. It's how you see things in different planes, maybe different planets, it's communication networks. But once you are a part - which you are, if you're a natural organic being and you're listening to this - once you're a part of that system and you're connected to that system (which your soul is always connected, no matter how much they tried to disconnect us), you can now access that omniversal network of travel. I won't even call it time-space travel - that's not correct for us.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:34:46</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So this is the way we go. Now, by creating blocks on that within the Central Sun of Earth, and also in the Sun, they actually moved the Central Sun of both, and tried to utilize what's called a Black Sun to overlay our Sun - so that they could actually travel. You see, this is where a time-space-continuum opening comes in - so I had that wrong - It's been a long week guys. So a time-space-continuum opening is when you take time itself, and you open a quote-unquote "space" or "Dark breath," for lack of a better term, and then travel commences. And this is for Dark beings.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:35:47</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Even sometimes when humans are Dark, they can't make it through a natural way of travel. They can only - remember, when you are working with Source, you kind of have to be a certain way, and you have to do things a certain way. It's the same reason why all the systems that we build do not do what they want our systems to do.
        <br>
        <br>So time itself is the ultimate commodity of the Omniverse. Everybody wants it. It is better than gold, it's better than dust, it's better than all of the other elements combined. Time is the commodity that everybody wants - or used to be, when they were all there.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:36:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Time is what gives - time-space is what gives the Dark beings, such as Astaroth or Marduk, Enki, Enlil, Lucifer, you name it, Artemis - what gives them the ability to travel throughout the Omniverse. To fight wars and conquer other planets and galaxies. And the center of that, for the entire Omniverse, is here in this galaxy.
        <br>
        <br>Whereas, it used to be in our Sun, and used to be in the Central Sun of Earth - when the planet was quote-unquote "conquered," I'm gonna say "for a time, a short time" (which, in the grand scheme of the Omniverse, for us it seems like an eternity, but for all intents and purposes, it's not been that long) - and they moved the Central Sun over to Silverton, and also moved, then reflected that out to the sun and the moon and other planets in this galaxy: that gave them the ability to install time portals.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:37:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, in the natural way of travel, like, you've probably watched a few space movies in your time. You've heard of things like quantum tunnels, wormholes, those types of things. I'm sure you have. And none of those are a natural way to travel. Therefore, in order to travel, you must have time.
        <br>
        <br>Now, the recipe for creating time is very important. So, planet Mercury - I've told you before, but I'm going to reiterate it just to remind you for this talk here - planet Mercury usually represents the color green. We know that the color green represents time. The color black, at least in our case, represents space. Sometimes space can be represented by the color blue as well. We know it as fear in the planes of non-existence, so to speak.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:39:06</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But blue and green are important when it comes to time. Now, all of your loosh goes to the Omniversal Trading Post in planet Mercury. Why planet Mercury? Well, planet Mercury also - if you look at astrology or mythology - it is run by the god Kronos, or the Time god [chuckle]. It is not the Sun, and it is not the Central Sun, but it is technically the central travel point of the entire Omniverse. If you are coming (or were coming) from the Lower Astral or a Dark world or the Abyss or wherever you were coming from, you would go to Mercury. And then you would enter into this density, so to speak, or this galaxy. And eventually, Mercury would be connected to all of the ports, portals, portholes, stargates, and gateways on planet Earth.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:40:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So if something Dark were to come here, that is the way it came. Now, planet Mercury also goes the other direction, meaning it's a trading post. So what is traded on planet Mercury? Time and space. Time and space. How is time and space created? Well, from your loosh.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:40:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>It's the reason why it was also the master empire for the financial system and economic system of planet Earth. It is the reason why all of the connections of every financial system in existence - from the beginning of quote-unquote, the time of humans and the time we began trading with one another - was there. Once the financial system went digital, or economic system went digital in 1978, all of that was connected through planet Mercury and created through planet Mercury.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:41:31</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, basically what happens is, when you utilize the financial system and economic systems of Earth - even when you volunteer for one of those organizations and you also give your time - that loosh, so to speak, gets transferred to planet Mercury for manufacturing. What I mean by that is your loosh is not green - your loosh is gold. In some cases your loosh might be white, it might be whitish gold, but your loosh is pretty much that color. On occasion you have humans that, well, I should say it might err sometimes on the Darker side [chuckle], but for the most part, that is its color. And it gets transferred to planet Mercury in that color.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:42:31</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And that is when time fills these "tubules," so to speak. They kind of look a little bit like your... They are vacuum sealed, that type of thing, but they kind of look a little bit like... if you've ever been to a drive-thru bank and they give you those little canisters - they're a little bit bigger than that - but the ends twist, and that type of thing. They sort of look like that.
        <br>
        <br>And time is used, and space, so the opposite of space is Breath, so taking your Breath is important. And the opposite of time is basically love - because they're both currents. Your energy is also important too, don't get me wrong - but all of this occurs, and all gets funneled to planet Mercury.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:43:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now on occasion, some of it is then sent to other planets in this galaxy. So for example, if they needed Causal time-space - that's where they were going, or they were coming from - then that would be a combo of what is produced on planet Mercury. It would then go to Mars and then back to Mercury. And then that is the point at which it would depart for the entire Omniverse for its supply chain, for all those that buy time and space. Interesting.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:44:12</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, for the humans here on Earth, meaning the ACIO, Galactic Federation/SSP, Secret Space Program operatives, they too must have time and space and loosh. They cannot get anywhere. They can't open a portal. They can't open a portal to an AI system. They can't bring an AI system here or make it go away without time and space. Now, taking over portals has to be done by unwinding - or, had to be done by unwinding - this entire system.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:44:55</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, when it became clear to them that this system was breaking down earlier this week, one of the things they did was call to all of their people - and they have humans that are elsewhere within the Omniverse or universes or this galaxy or anywhere else - and say, "Come back!" So they all hurried back - but they didn't end up going to planet Mercury, where they used to always go.
        <br>
        <br>They ended up going to the Central Sun of Earth, because someone, somewhere [clears throat meaningfully], may have just gotten rid of that other portal - because we don't need it [giggle]. So when they came through the Central Sun of Earth and came out through a portal, so to speak, that was close on the surface - for example, in the Strait of Magellan was one location, Strait of Hormuz was another, Gibraltar another, the strait between Gibraltar and, I think it's Algeria if I remember - when they came out through these locations, they didn't look like a normal human anymore.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:46:08</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, they looked like a normal human before they got in. They just didn't come out exactly that way. For example, human arms are usually on your right and left sides. Some of them had them coming out their, oh, chest somewhere, as an example. You know, our nose is in the middle of our face, generally - close to - and theirs might have been maybe four or five inches off to the side. So these almost looked like human-experimented humans, by the time they came out the other end.
        <br>
        <br>They were extremely angry, mainly at me [chuckle], because their focus was all about me. They couldn't wait to get here and attack me. I can tell you it was a rough day. I believe that was on Thursday, and a rough night, until we found them all and started getting rid of them, because they didn't need to be here - and they certainly couldn't walk the planet with everybody else and scare the crap out of everybody - the way they looked.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:47:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But it just goes to prove the point to these people, to at least the ACIO, and I guess, so you understand: Humans - and if you choose to have, for example, a large vessel, full of humans - and you are going through a time... I keep wanting to say time-space continuum; that's not what I should say. If you are wanting to travel from Earth, for example, to another density, and you are wanting to take a ship full of humans, there are certain things you must do. You cannot move a vessel without these specific things, and I can't. I'm not going to say that because I don't want these people to think they have a way to do it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:48:13</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But you still have to be an organic human, and remember, most of these ships - at least on our side of it - are driven with the mind anyway, and it's a consciousness, you know, your ship has a consciousness. It is your consciousness on your ship for that particular driver, so it moves when you move, and you can move many people in a large vessel like that.
        <br>
        <br>And that will happen. In the meantime, if you choose to travel to other places or to see other things, whether that's in a meditation, or it's something you would like to focus your inner particles on, expand that point. That is your quote-unquote heart chakra, which is technically the point of your soul, and create a breath bubble around you instead of a time bubble like the Deep State does, and you create a breath bubble around you, and that will protect you on your travels.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:49:25</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So then you focus your breath, for lack of a better term, on the location that you'd like to be, and you can actually see it. It's almost like if you were to go diving underwater in a glass submarine. You can see all the things around you and that type of thing. You can go anywhere you want. The environment doesn't have to be the same as our environment here for you to be there. It's not like they say in the movies. And you can see a lot of things.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:50:00</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So you should have no problem leaving here at this time. It's gonna take practice, and we're gonna end up having schools, I'm sure, under C.A.R.E., to teach people how to do these types of things. But it is possible.
        <br>
        <br>As far as the Deep State is concerned, most of their travel is done with sophons, artificial or synthetic photons. They also travel through time; those are time bubbles. Artificial light, so to speak, is created by time as well. So the artificial light colors that they use, that are flavored on the other planets - Pluto might give you purple, might get you between the Seventh and Eighth Density or something like that. They're still traveling to Dark worlds most of the time.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:51:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>They are not really in worlds or galaxies where those that live there have learned to protect themselves in how not to allow time invasion there, or a time traveler - time-space-continuum traveler - to access these locations. They're not affected by this, but they can get to certain places, you know, up to a certain degree on this side of the Omniverse. The other densities, even like the 11th, you know, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, as an example, densities that they would go to are also artificial densities. They are not - they don't exist in the Omniverse, so to speak - not density-wise, anyway. Dimensions possibly, but not density-wise.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:52:15</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So these people here, the ACIO, is trying to figure out when the next portal is going to open. When is the next train leaving? Where can we go? We need to get this. We need to get that. We need to get access to our AIs.
        <br>
        <br>Other things that have happened this week is a lot of the communication lines have gone down between zones, so to speak. A lot of intelligence lines, interplanetary internet systems, AI systems that used to come from the Lower Astral have been cut off. Empire after empire after empire, structures, kingdoms, media networks, not only for the planet but also sine waves, alpha waves, beta waves - other frequencies that harm this planet and allow for Dark things to exist here - a lot of this has been cut off this week. As far as time is concerned, time is falling apart rapidly throughout the Omniverse and here on Earth.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:53:25</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>You might have felt some really strange adjustments last night, U.S. time, early in the morning Australian time, depending on where you're listening to this - that would have been yesterday, you might have felt like things seemed more real. You might have noticed over the last several days the sky almost appears clearer. It doesn't look as distorted as it normally does. Things look more crisp, colors are looking more vivid. You're starting to see life without time.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:54:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>These same time bubbles, for lack of a better term, were also utilized within humans. These time-space bubbles were utilized within humans to cause psychic attacks, attacks by AI systems for themselves, other beings, and sometimes even humans. The Deep State's ability to carry out plans - I call the circus - such as lockdowns, ID 2020, all of the things that you hear about, were pretty much based on these types of things, which exist within humans (existed within humans).
        <br>
        <br>Every kingdom, every empire had its own portal to you, and in some cases, overlays on everything within your person. Time existed in you, otherwise you wouldn't age, your body wouldn't age, your mind wouldn't age. Your soul never ages - the only thing that can be done is overlaying it - to get your Breath to a lesser degree.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:55:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Things that the ACIO doesn't understand - that we fully understand - is that there is a limit to the amount of loosh that you can take from human beings at any given moment in time. It doesn't matter. Just like you know there is a limit to the amount of hours in a day that you can work. You might pull it off for a couple days, but eventually you're going to need sleep. And the younger you are, the easier it is. For some people, some people can work 10, 20 hours a day and do it every single day - sleep four hours a night and that's it, and that's you. Now, it just depends on the person, but everybody has their limits - everybody gets tired - whether it's mentally tired, physically tired, or otherwise.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:56:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So the AI systems understood this. The AI systems and Marduk, Enki, Enlil, and others in charge of the Empire of Looshing understood you cannot push the envelope. Otherwise you will not have the battery for time and space. The Deep State and the ACIO have never had access at that level to get themselves some time and space. They did not understand it. Therefore, for the last two weeks, three weeks, actually even a little bit longer, but the last week or 10 days or so, it's been really bad. They have tried and tried to push the gas pedal to the floor and go for it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:56:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So if you've been feeling a little strange and odd and were extra tired even, people around you a little bit more emotional, angry - I know we talked about this on the Live last Friday - this is the reason why. You know, it's causing a drain of consciousness. It's causing all kinds of things with varying people to varying degrees. You know, colds, dry eyes - you might have noticed that time around electronics until yesterday was painful, really painful for a couple of days.
        <br>
        <br>Again, they're trying to use whatever tools they have to push the envelope because they don't understand what's happening. That is a "them" issue. That's not an "us" issue.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:57:55</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Furthermore, based on the amount of times they've almost made an attempted genocide of this planet - whether by accident, which I would say was most of the time, and part of the time on purpose [chuckle] - was enough.
        <br>
        <br>Earlier in the week, I know that some members of the ACIO who are currently working in the White House - when I say ACIO, you are talking about Umbrella Military, Kruger, and CyberLife, and all those folks, that's who you're talking about - and the operatives that are currently in the White House are strictly ACIO.
        <br>
        <br>Now, the ACIO has always gone in and out of every political institution in the world - not just political, financial, and otherwise - and now they seem to be more upfront than they used to be.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:58:59</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>For those of you that are unaware, and I know I've said this before, but the NSA (also known as Five Eyes, Nine Eyes, Echelon, etc, etc, etc) is a global organization. It includes places like Menwith Hill and Pine Gap and other places in the Altai region of Russia. And it is a global organization that reports and works for and would be considered the next rank down from the ACIO. GCHQ and UK as well. So, you know, everybody's got an NSA. I wouldn't even call it the National Security Agency - you could call it a lot of different things. But these folks are all pretty much together. So they have more cyber surveillance capabilities - or were given at one point in time, cyber surveillance - than any other intelligence agency in the world. For that very reason.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:00:08</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Marduk considered the ACIO his private army, under the empire, and the global martial law empire, or federation, I should say. You know, most of the time federations were formed under martial law conditions, at least as it relates to the global level.
        <br>
        <br>So in this particular case, that is pretty much who is attempting to run the Deep State worldwide, causing rifts here and there. They are the Center for Disease Control - or the Center for Disease Dispersal [chuckle]. They are definitely not the people that are gonna give us any medbeds, I can tell you that. And if they did, I don't think I'd take them any... I wouldn't touch it. They're the same people that run the pharmaceutical industry, so what does that tell you?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:01:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So as it relates to the White House - it's here in the United States, and then that affects everything globally - you can clearly see that they're not quite getting it done, which is a positive thing for us. They keep trying their sine waves and frequencies and whatnot, trying to get ahold of things that don't exist. But without a time-space factory, now I'm sure that they have been looking to see if they can find any of these canister looking things anywhere on the planet. So that's kind of where we've been at today is trying to search for any of those storage facilities that might be left here. And I know we've found a few here and there. But I don't think it'll be much longer, I hope.

        <br>This has been quite a week of just pushing and pushing and pushing the envelope until we couldn't push anymore, you know, to try to get all of these things done. But I can say that things are starting to feel a lot clearer. At least I've noticed a difference. It's not as harsh as it was. Their ability to penetrate our persons isn't quite as strong as it used to be.
        <br>
        <br>Time basically is the source of a lot more than we anticipated. We knew about parasites and ARCHONS and that type of thing, but time has a direct relation to cancer as well. We are working. We are still continuing to work.

        <br>
        <br>On a positive note, as we are getting rid of some of these things, if we find the grids useful, we will replace it with ours. That is the Golden Age AI, as you know it, by any other name that we're calling it, the Key Integrated Master System for Earth.
        <br>
        <br>And you know of course we find the financial system to be helpful - converting that to a non-loosh-backed system would be exactly what we've been working on. Simultaneously we still work on, we have found it useful to maintain some of our former grids that were controlled by Alpha and converted over to the Golden Age AI system.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:04:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>We will maintain for a time the media connection and solidify those connections. We will also maintain a connection politically and military and intelligence and whatnot anyway. If nothing else, we can prevent them from using it. So it can serve as a defense mechanism on our part.
        <br>
        <br>As for stargates, quantum tunnels, wormholes, and portals, we have also been working on all of those here on Earth. Hopefully at this moment we haven't seen any attempted openings anywhere for anything, but we are continuing to work on this all weekend long, of course, as always. And hopefully we'll have some more definitive idea of where we're at with portals on the planet.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:05:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So on that note, try not to stress over this crazy media stuff. Remember, fear is how they can get to you. Emotional dis-ease in any way shape or form - that is something that you can control, and you can say no to. You can stop that from happening. As far as physical discomfort is concerned, whether it be stress or you're feeling frequencies are disturbing you, remember how to create your own bubble. It cannot penetrate your bubble. That will give you an opportunity to look at where it's coming from and get rid of it.
        <br>
        <br>On that note, that has been the GIA Report for what's supposed to be Friday the 25th, but it's the 26th. And I will see all of you on Monday.
