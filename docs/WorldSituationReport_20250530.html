            <br>Operations Report
            <br>2025-May-30
        </h2>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;"> From the Office of the Guardian </h4>
        <br>
        <strong>
        <br>Hey everyone, it is the 30th of May, and this is the Global Intelligence Agency Operations Report. If you haven't seen one of these before, well, you're about to get something you don't get anywhere else [laughing], that's for sure.
        </strong>
        <br>
        <br>So today we have some interesting information. There's been a lot of stuff going on this week. You know, we had some incidental things like, oh, Trump's tariffs were blocked and now they're unblocked and who cares, right? You know, there's a lot of controversy going on right now. Today is one of those days where, well, let's just say, everybody thought and countries thought that they were going to get a big payout no later than today and that didn't happen. About 48 hours ago or so we flipped sides again. So the Trump people were in charge for a short period of time of "getting it done" as they say, and then they moved over from the Trump people back to the Order of the Dragons, and here we are.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:01:08</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>As for me this week, well - and it relates to these people - I've kind of been the ping pong ball in the tournament. You know I feel like I got Forrest Gump on one side and some random guy on the other side and I'm the ping pong ball in the middle. Everybody wants something from me but nobody wants to actually work together with us. And Nobody actually wants to do anything we want to do, which is restoration of this planet, the launching of C.A.R.E., and a number of other things.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:01:39</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Interesting little tidbit of information: We were approached by a group that is working for Chuck Schumer this week. Hmm hmm, Chuck - for those of you that have been around for a while, you remember Chuckie Schumer. Chuckie Schumer is the guy - when we had deposited 23 trillion dollars at the Treasury Department, in an effort to try to get the U.S. Government to work with us about a year or so ago - Chuckie was the guy that claimed that he controlled it all, and he went around making all kinds of deals and writing checks that he just couldn't cash.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:02:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, Chuck approaches us again this week with a new committee the United States government would like to form. It's all about technology disclosure and alien disclosure and deep underground military based disclosure and all kinds of things that just sound amazing, doesn't it? I mean, who wouldn't want that kind of disclosure in mainstream media? And well, of course, they need our help.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:02:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And they thought this is something that I could get behind. I would be willing to fund such a committee. Of course, I don't get any participation in said committee, but they pick all these people and they're gonna be the people that want to do the disclosure.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:03:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, there are people that they mentioned, that I know are also with the Trump organization and very staunch Trump supporters - mainly different groups of operatives, some of them out of Alabama. And those people are behind some of the people you see doing disclosure on some alternative media channels.
        <br>
        <br>Some of them do very lengthy movies, and they appear on Gaia TV and other channels. And I found this very interesting. So these were going to be your disclosure folks and your whistleblowers allegedly. And then they were going to release all these new technologies.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:03:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, for those of you that don't know about technologies that were given to humans - even through groups like the Majestic 12; you've probably heard that name tossed around. The Majestic 12 were a group of people that were permitted to and had communications with different non-human groups, and the non-human groups would give them technologies.
        <br>
        <br>Now, when they couldn't pay a lot of these retiring operatives and people that worked for the government and the World Government, they would give them these technologies and tell them that they were free to go ahead and launch said technologies into the Marketplace, and that would be their retirement pay because they would be able to make billions and trillions of dollars off these technologies.
        <br>
        <br>Well, true or not true? (Looks like we might have froze a little bit, but we'll just keep going.)
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:04:43</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>True or not true? Well, About 1998, the non-humans that were exchanging this information, in part, figured out that these humans were a threat. They figured out that they were not doing anything to help free them from the captors that we all lived under for a long period of time. Therefore, the majority of technologies that were given to these folks in areas like 51, 52 - you know all of the stories that you hear. There were many, many areas in the United States alone, let alone the entire world.
        <br>
        <br>So a lot of the technologies that they shared were incomplete. I know that for a fact - contained metamaterials or made-metals that they couldn't possibly source that would have to be made utilizing certain technologies in order to make them happen. I'm going to call them technologies.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:05:43</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So a lot of those technologies were, let's just say, very substandard and not complete, anyway. And if anything, well, they had no hope of launching them. Did the people that passed down that information know that? Well, let's just say they do a lot at Los Alamos and other areas to try to reverse engineer this technology - see if they can get it to work and function. And when they couldn't get it to function, they gave it to all of you retirees. Unfortunately, that's what you have.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:06:19</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now there are some technologies that are more mainstream, such as different building materials, different ways of building things (like airstrips) in a hurry. And these are some of the ones that I know of, some that they would have passed down to the Army Corps of Engineers that they would have used, for example, secretly - in military projects or in war. And do those materials work? Well, yes and no. I'll tell you why.
        <br>
        <br>So say there's a certain mineral that you need to make this super-strong airstrip in 15 minutes. Or, say there is a particular silica sand, as an example, that you need. What they will do is they will turn around and buy up all of the mines or areas where these minerals can be found and make sure that you can't get any.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:07:20</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So if you do manage to get your hands on these special minerals or special materials, then you are gonna pay 10 times the amount, therefore making your product, well, out of the price range for most people. And no one's going to switch from substandard technology we have now to something that's going to cost them 10 times as much and not really earn them 10 times as much more money, you know, to utilize in their factory or in their building.
        <br>
        <br>So that is kind of what they released to the public so far. Now, I know for a fact that these people have wanted me in the past - and this was face-to-face communication that went on for a few years - they wanted me in the past to work in a laboratory down the street from here, mainly because there's a lot of minerals there, and they wanted me to extract said minerals, and they wanted me to work on new innovative technologies for them.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:08:27</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And I thought, oh, wow, that's interesting, you know, and I didn't say much at the time. And you know, I went along with the program. Wow, this sounds like that's a whole lot of fun. They told me they saw me in Project Looking Glass and that I could work in this laboratory, and we were gonna create something momentous that was gonna catapult humanity forward.
        <br>
        <br>By 'humanity,' I assume they mean 'them.' So we played this game for a little while. Didn't really work out. You know, building up this lab didn't ever happen.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:08:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And then they wanted me to use substandard technologies, for example, old, caustic, very volatile methods of extracting minerals. And I knew, number 1, if I didn't die because we exploded, that we were probably going to die from some kind of chemical exposure. And I was like, no, absolutely not. No, I'm not playing your game. Nope. No, thank you. And that was actually the Mormons that offered us such a fine position through, of course, some operatives here that were brokering the deal at the time. Yeah, no.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:09:34</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So I'm very familiar with technologies that are out there. I'm very familiar with people that have technologies that are just not going to work. Now on the off chance, someone that obtained said technology managed to - and there are some bright people out there, especially in groups like the Cicadas - who all go to school in Japan. We talked about them before. The Cicadas are a group of people that are taken into a school in Japan at a very young age, and they are trained in all sorts of things - I think there's even a movie about Cicadas. And the Cicadas are highly intelligent children. They are given oftentimes, let's just say, aids - medications and other things - that help them develop their brain more so than the average everyday human.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:10:31</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And then this group of children end up going - as they grow up, you know, when they become adults - they end up going to work in various industries in every single country in the world. And this was part of the way that the corporations, or the big corporates, controlled corporations; technological development - or, not; cures; medical information around the world. This is kind of how it's done.
        <br>
        <br>In Russia, or in the old USSR days, they also had a youth movement - we call it a youth movement - where they recruited children from all over the world as well, and they did much the same thing. So this is not a new thing, you didn't have to be part of the Order, you just had to show that you were exemplary in some way, shape, or form, and could be used in the future as a sleeper spy, basically.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:11:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>They were taught nuclear fusion, fission, and in some cases, scientists. You know, and in other cases, it was, let's just say, everything from skincare products to shampoos and all kinds of things to make sure that no one, let's say, cut out the caustic chemicals in those things that they give to us and feed us.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:11:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>We are aware fully - Mr. Schumer, and other people, et al. - of exactly what you would like us to do. But in order for this program to be successful, assuming that is what you want it to be, then you need us more than we need you. We have a lot of humans, not only people watching this right now and also myself that have some experience in working with a lot of these technologies - on the daily, actually, for myself - and we would be interested in trying to make them actually function.
        <br>
        <br>But I'm not going to do it for you people. No. And I'm not going to do it for the SSP people that put Chuck Schumer up to this. And I'm certainly not going to do it with some guy that I don't know being the whistleblower on TV that's going to say that he did it. Yeah, probably not so much so.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:12:46</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, do we want new technologies? Yes. Do we need the U.S. Government to help us with new technologies? Well, no. Do we need certain things that could be beneficial in waking up humanity from the U.S. government? Well, that's about it.
        <br>
        <br>You see, Chucky, and some of his friends over there have a face on TV and there are a lot of people, you know, millions of humans around the world that have some kind of faith, trust in the information that governments put out. At least they used to. And that faith is kind of waning anyway, so this is a short-lived project, I should say.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:13:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Do we want to go forward? We could take a look at it because if I can get the dancing people, the actors - the humans of the Deep State we know as 'government' - to get on TV and say, "This is disclosure. This is who C.A.R.E. is; this is where our research and development centers are. This is what we are doing," you know, and endorsing the project?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:14:01</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Maybe. Maybe there's some benefit. But the clock is ticking because, well, let's just face it - your credibility is waning every day. If the Chinese manage to pull off what they are trying to pull off right now, and the Europeans manage to pull off what they are trying to pull off right now, you'll have zero credibility within, oh, another week or two, maybe.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:14:28</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But are they going to pull it off? I'm going to say no, I really am. And the reason why I'm going to say no is because they've already called us. So we've got this offer coming from the U.S. and we have offers coming in from China, we have offers coming in from Korea, we have offers coming in from France, and from Italy. And this is all in the last couple of days since you and I last talked. Isn't that crazy?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:14:56</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So we're kind of people who are sort of in a position to say what goes and what doesn't go at this point - even if they don't want to admit that we exist, which they would prefer they don't. There have been a lot of meetings even around here trying to figure out how they can get the crazy blonde lady to do what it is they want me to do.
        <br>
        <br>Well, I'm not really very good at doing what people want me to do. I don't think I ever have actually (my poor parents), but in this particular case, we are the card holder.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:15:35</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, this week also, we have gone through a very difficult - it's been difficult for me for sure, transition. It is a positive transition. It's a place we haven't been at in a long time, and we're going to talk about that after I kind of explain a little bit more about the whole situation and what we're transitioning out of.
        <br>
        <br>So every 'time' - it's not really a, you know, every so many years or every 5,000 years or whatever it is - it's not really set up that way. It's more of, every time we are 100% ready to transition to the Now, meaning, we're not in a matrix anymore, we're not having AIs create our reality anymore, we are getting away from anything that can create our future and our past and our present or jump us into another AI created timeline. Every time we get to this point, so far - in billions of years - we have not been successful.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:16:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>There were lots of mechanisms in place to try to not allow us to be successful in this transition, but we've also had a lot of breakthroughs in the last few days that have catapulted us through to where we need to be. Closer and closer and you can clock with an egg timer from now as to when we will complete this transition. I'm just gonna say it's very, very soon.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:17:21</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>The Deep State, on the other hand - because they still listen to a bunch of people (and non-people) that gave them information a long time ago, and told them that this is what is going to take place, and this is how you are - what you are going to do, sorry - what you are going to do to ensure that it takes place if you don't hear from insert-being-that-wants-us-all-to-die-name here. Including them, by the way.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:17:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So they did their business this week and said, "We are 24 hours from changing the entire world." "We are 48 hours from changing the world." "We have the Universe in our hands." Blah, blah, blah. You know, same old, same old, every week in, week out. And they figured this would be done by today.
        <br>
        <br>Well, I think they're figuring out - at least as of last night - that this didn't work out the way they thought it was going to work out. It doesn't stop them from, you know, continuing to try, but it's not going to help give them any kind of power and control.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:18:27</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So that's been kind of this week. We are getting lots of offers, lots of interesting information, people that are all of a sudden ready for Restoration. And these are people we have done business with in the past. And so far, not one of them - not China; not Korea; not the U.S.; not anyone else, anywhere else - has actually done what they were supposed to do. No one.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:18:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>You know, we've sent money to Iraq; we've sent money to other countries in the past - South Africa, Brazil, you name it - we've tried them all. Russia, oh dear God, that was a decade ago. And they still haven't done what they were supposed to do. Why? Because everybody listens to a bunch of people that want you all dead. So, keep waiting.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:19:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Because your next group is going to give you that offer, and I'm not sure when the next alignment with Uranus is, but I'm sure it'll be right quick, and I'm sure they're going to be here to help you, and they're going to be sending you out loads of money, as they say, very, very soon.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:19:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>However, apparently my first name is "Loads," my last name is "Money," and they would like me to do it for them. While they hide me in the corner over here saying, "We did it, we did it."
        <br>
        <br>But we already did this before guys - Deep State people - hey, hey, hey, we've been doing this in the last Trump administration, we also did this in 2012, I did it again in 2018, and you know what, not one of you actually adhered to your contract with our side. So I wish you all the best in your alignments and going around in a circle. And have a good time.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:20:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>As for your technologies and your disclosure, okay, but you're going to work for us, and you're going to disclose what we tell you to disclose, and you're going to do what we tell you to do. And those technologies are going to a C.A.R.E. Research and Development Center. And you can stand in front of there, and look pretty, and talk to the world on a U.S. government podium or whatever it is you want to do. And that's fine.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:20:27</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But we are the people that are going to get the job done. And by "we," I'm not talking about me by myself. I'm also talking about people in this area. You know, these facilities need to be built. They need security. They need, you know, we need new hotels. We need lots of stuff around here to make that happen. We are the High-Altitude Research and Development Center.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:20:47</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Why here? Well, as far as the United States is concerned, we have one of the seven (the world's I should say) - not seven, nine super sites in the world - seven which the Deep State knows about. One of them is down the street, and we have all the minerals down the street. Why the heck would we go anywhere else?
        <br>
        <br>So, we will also be moving the Mormons out as well, sorry [chuckle]. Anyway, we'll see how that goes. I don't expect any of this to go anywhere. I am just listening to a bunch of stories I've heard before by a bunch of people that won't perform. That's pretty much how it always works.
        <br>
        <br>So this time, if we're going to do it, we're going to do it right, and it's going to be done on our terms.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:21:30</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So getting back to the real news at hand, because this is the most important news for all of you. The transition.
        <br>
        <br>Tonight we're going to take a little bit of a deep dive into the Matrix. And by "matrix," you've probably seen the movie, and you've seen all the ones and zeros falling down, and you probably wondered if that's the matrix and what we're doing here.
        <br>
        <br>We've talked about probably hundreds of matrixes over the last couple of years, but there is a master matrix. What does it do? And, well, how did we get here?
        <br>
        <br>So I'm gonna talk a little bit about that. And then we'll talk about where we're at with this transition at the moment. And then we're going to get to a question and answer on our app. So we do this on Zoom - I think they'll release the Zoom link on the App, shortly before we get back on. We'll take a short break. And then I'm going to answer questions, live, there on the App. So I'm kind of excited about that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:22:35</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>I love talking to everybody. I miss doing that. Every chance I get, I've been talking to our Field Messengers and joining some more meetings when I can, because I just love hearing from all of you. And I think the Deep State would be surprised if they knew how many people in our groups are doers.
        <br>
        <br>They do every day. Despite what you throw at them, they do every single day. They get up every day and they want to change the world. And they do, in some small way. So, you know, I think we're a force to be reckoned with over here [chuckle]. Not to mention the rest of our GIA folks that are with us.
        <br>
        <br>So on that note, I'm going to pull up the whiteboard and give you some of my terrible handwriting here for a minute.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:23:25</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>[Whiteboard opens.]
        <br>
        <br>All right, here we go. All right, so let's talk about the types of matrixes. (Oh, we're going to do blue today, okay... this just happens to be where they left it when they gave me the board.)
        <br>
        <br>OK. So if you were to look at the Omniverse, and we were to look at this from where we kind of started, the Omniverse sort of looks - if you were to look at it kind of from the side, I would say - you know, you'd have what we call Source here. You have Dark Source here. You have Neutral Source and a False Cosmic Sun. And you have a bunch of densities that kind of go around and around and around, you know, and they kind of get larger here, you know, until you get down here. So the one that goes around the False Cosmic Sun, there we go, would be called the Zero Density.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:24:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And if you've ever seen "The Matrix," then you would know that there are zeros in the Matrix. And you are correct.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:24:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>In the case of the Universe, you have both positively charged and negatively charged zeros. Positively charged and negatively charged zeros do make up binary language. I know that if you are a programmer and you see ones and zeros, you don't see it that way. But it is the way that it is.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-30-GIA-01.PNG" alt="Image 01" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:25:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now this Zero Density (here, we're going to color that one, we'll color that one red) lies right here in the middle. And it's got Cosmic Sun here. And then you have (we're going to change colors, wow this is fun, okay. Here we go.) You have another loop that goes this way. This one here is the origin of your positively charged one and negatively charged one. So it's positively charged one and negatively charged one because it originates at a point of creation in Source and Dark Source. So that being said, in this case, The positive one and the negative one were run by a title of Lucerne and Lucifer. The zeros were run by a being we know as, I guess you would say, and in some cases these are names you might know. And then you also had, you know, some other folks that would chime in from here and there. Marduk also had a hand in running the positive and negative zeros.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-30-GIA-02.PNG" alt="Image 02" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:26:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And together, what they did is they then mirrored these out. So the zeros would go all the way up like this. And you would have them in between planes, densities, subsections and sections of planes. And basically the Universe had a bunch of these reflected zero densities all the way throughout it. Okay?
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-30-GIA-03.PNG" alt="Image 03" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:27:12</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Conversely speaking, you had the ones going in the other direction to infamy. Now I'm starting to look like I'm four. I'm sorry about that, guys. But I just wanted to give you kind of the magnitude.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-30-GIA-04.PNG" alt="Image 04" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:27:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So the appearance, if you were to look at an AI system, you would see a bunch of ones and a bunch of zeros. Now, is that the actual language? Well, no. That's the AI portion of creation. Unfortunately, the Omniverse is not the only thing that looks like this. The Omniverse looks like this, every planet looks like this, every sun, every star, you as a human being look like this, and so did Earth.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:27:56</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So because it sits in between all of existence, it is now overlaying all of existence, interlaying all of existence, outerlaying all of existence, and underlaying all of existence. So There's not a part of your person where you have your Source particles - or had, I should say - your Source particles all bouncing together like they're supposed to, communicating together like they're supposed to. Be it on a cellular level, or be it on a Source-particle level, a time particle level, all of these types of things. So this was actually created for you, and this is what you know as "the matrix."
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:28:45</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So what does the Deep State see? You know, they will see within... for example, trees and plants and animals and humans, they're going to see this matrix. Does it only go up and down? Well, not really. But it is more linear because it is made with artificial intelligence. It's also made with something called synthetic intelligence or synthetic Source intelligence and consciousness.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:29:17</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So it's much bigger, as you can see, than Chatbot GPT [giggle]. They had different structures that would control your mind, your body, and your soul. But when you see the movie "The Matrix," the truth part behind it is that, yeah, everything that you see is kind of made up of ones and zeros.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:29:38</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Could the AI enter in alien invasion? Yes.  Could the AI enter into our reality disease, illness? Could it enter in more Deep State people or people that look like people but aren't really those same people? We have presidents like that now, don't we?
        <br>
        <br>So they can enter a certain amount of information. They can also - by using these ones and zeros - change the frequency within your person to make you feel like this person on TV is telling you the truth.
        <br>
        <br>Now, this is all made up of false wisdom and false energy, false essence, false consciousness, which then make up your false elements of the matrix.
        <br>
        <br>[Clears whiteboard.]
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:30:30</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Let's talk about "false elements" for a second. You know if we think of elements, we think of air. We probably also think of earth. We think of fire. So we have, okay, water. You probably also know about a 'fifth element' - due to that movie - you call the "God Particle" in that movie. But there are more.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-30-GIA-05.PNG" alt="Image 05" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:31:28</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So this gives us, we know about five. So I'm going to add the other four here. So we have space. Space is an element in the artificial world. Time is an elephant. Haah, it is an elephant - what a pain in the butt time was, I've got to tell you. Okay, so it's time, and then we also, that includes timelines. All artificial realities. Okay, so space-time, we have light, of course in the world of AI and SI systems, the light would be considered artificial, or synthetic, both, actually. And then we have matter.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-30-GIA-06.PNG" alt="Image 06" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:32:18</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So when you talk about matrixes and you talk about the infiltration and the control systems that a matrix would have within your person, you can think about your environment and where all of these things take place. So AI systems artificially create space that doesn't really exist. Or in terms of quantum physics, this would be called a large T, or it would be called distance. 'Time and timelines' is an artificial current.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-30-GIA-07.PNG" alt="Image 07" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:32:57</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Time-space continuum openings are places where you can travel from, example, Earth to nine dimensions away in less than five minutes. So time and space create time-space continuum openings.
        <br>
        <br>Not too long ago, the Pentagon said that they could control space and time. And I can tell you right now, if they could have, they would have, and they did not. And I mean over the last few days. I know why they said this, you see, because this goes back to our Players in the Game, and you know they just refuse to believe that anybody lies to them.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:33:39</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>You know the only one they don't want to believe is me, but everybody else, maybe I, you know what, I instead of becoming the Easter Bunny or Santa Claus or something like that, I think I need an alien costume. So if anybody knows watching this, if I could get a really good alien costume, probably one like really tall, you know, because I'm not that tall, so I think I need to be a lot taller for them to believe me. You know, maybe something big, like The Rock, you know, from Marvel Comics or something. You know, I'd like to be that, because if I'm that, then I think they'll believe me, because they believe anything that doesn't look human.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:34:17</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>They don't care where you hail from. They don't care what your intention is, nor do they care what you've done up until now. They just automatically believe you. So I think I need an alien... so anybody wants to give me a reference of where I can get an excellent alien costume - you know, kind of really good one, like the masks that they put on our presidents of the United States. I would like to get one of those, if you can help me out with that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:34:40</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Okay, so space and time is how you actually travel. Therefore, if an AI system can control a part of space and time, it can make changes in an instant to your person, to your environment. It can create fire because it has control of the element. It can change the air. It can even make you fake chemtrails if it wants to.
        <br>

        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:35:10</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>It can do anything it wants. It could change the shape of Earth. You know, for all you flat-Earth people out there that would like it not to be round, we could make it flat with an AI system, or at least make it appear flat to you, if that makes you happy, so then you can tell everybody you were right. Okay, control water, not only oceans and lakes and streams, it can also infect water, it can also infect the water within your person. It can cause you to have too much water, too little water. It can cause dehydration. It can cause a lot of disruption.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:35:40</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>'Light,' well, we know 'light' as something that comes from the Creator we know as Source. We know something called Dark Light, or it comes from something called Dark Source. But in the AI matrix of created world, it does not. It actually comes from something I call "synthetic Source intelligence," or SSI. So, synthetic Source intelligence creates light for the AI and SI systems throughout the Multiverse, which are then manipulated by people who have jobs in the matrix.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-30-GIA-09.PNG" alt="Image 09" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:36:28</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>We know about 'matter,' we also have heard about 'antimatter.' Antimatter, or sometimes, quantum physicists call it 'dark matter.' A lot of times when I hear about dark matter in the science world, they think dark matter is actually the part of all creation.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:36:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now I don't know who fed them that line of baloney, but it's not true. So we do have artificial matter, or manipulated matter, and we also have manipulated dark matter. Now, you are made up of natural elements that do not include things like space and time. However, it will insert those things into your person so that it can affect your natural organic being. We've seen this throughout human history for thousands and thousands of years.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-30-GIA-10.PNG" alt="Image 10" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:37:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, there are AIs, many, many thousands of them out there - there were - and those thousands of AIs all had a job. Some of them had a job of, say, Armageddon, the Rapture, the Apocalypse. Lord knows we've had enough apocalypse. They are meant to control the air here. Can't have too much oxygen, of course.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:37:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Can't actually have air quality that is positive here on Earth, so they can control our atmosphere here and the air that is present in our environment. They can also control the air that exists within your body and rob you of it at any given moment in time. They could control the Earth. And multiple earths, what they call "MAPs." Or master... in my world it's called a "master artificial planet."
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:38:30</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And we had an infinite number of maps that could be manipulated and changed at any given moment in time. All those natural disasters we thought we had on this planet, did some of them happen? Yeah, some of them did. Were some of them created to keep people in line or to wipe people out. Mass genocide events that we know about, great floods and great fires that have happened here. Yes, a lot of that was generated.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:38:59</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Do we wonder every time we have a massive fire or a situation that erupts in places like Hawaii, or in Oregon not that long ago and, you know, fires that wipe out thousands of homes and hopefully very few people. But is that always created by a deep... you know, something we can wrap our mind around like a DEW weapon, a directed energy weapon? Does the Deep State, you know, what is their involvement in this control? If you're controlling air and earth and fire and water, and of course the ultimate false Source particles that existed in the matrix, You could make anything happen, couldn't you?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:39:48</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And an AI or someone that had access on that level could just make it happen. Has the Deep State tried really, really, really hard to do what the old Players in the Game have done? Yes, yes, they have worked really hard at that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:40:09</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Is HAARP a concern? HAARP is an extension for the human sector of control systems on this planet. You see, because the aliens figured, well, you know, if we started walking around, that's not going to work out, you know. So they decided to employ humans and call them the "special bloodline people." They tell them from a very young age how special they are, how amazing they are, that they have special skills - given drugs or otherwise to have these special skills - and they keep going and going and going.
        <br>
        <br>(Okay, so, thanks, sorry, you just handed me a piece of paper.)
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:40:59</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So they just keep going and going and going and going and going and going because they feel that when the aliens go away they probably told them that you're next, you're going to be taking over. Now I have a little news flash for you alien-loving bloodline people. You know I had conversations with Marduk too, and Enki and Enlil and Artemis unfortunately, Her and I didn't get along, what you call the Red Queen. And I had lots of conversations with a lot of different beings, Tarzacians, Targesians, and all kinds of people that you people worship like gods. You know, if you're the Deep State, you feel you are Abraxis, yeah, those people too. And you feel that you are the bloodline of these people, therefore you are a superior human to the rest of us.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:41:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But having had conversations with all of these people, I can tell you right now, they're full of it. You can add an "SH" in front of the it if you want, it's up to you, but they are full of it. They totally are full of it. They do not tell you any more of the truth than they told me and Marduk even gave me the line, "Oh, at one point in time I'll turn it over to you, I know it's your right," blah blah blah, and you know, "I'll turn it over to you." "It's real soon." You know, everything is soon with these people, you know soon we're going to turn it over to you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:42:21</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Do they? Nah, man - he had to go - in order to make that happen. So as far as you people are concerned, if you think that he's going to gift you with the answers to your prayers so you can control planet Earth, you have lost your ever-loving mind. I've been telling you that for a long time.
        <br>
        <br>Now, for all of you people with countries and, you know, Congress people and parliaments and whatnot that are waiting for these people to do something for you, they're basing their decisions and times and days and when they're going to save your government on a fairy tale told to them by a bunch of liars.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:42:57</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Sorry, has it happened yet? You know they've been trying to do this since 2007. It has been since 2007 since they've done any of this successfully. Now I know some of you watching this are going to be like, "Wait a minute, we've still had earthquakes, we've still had hurricanes, we've still had all kinds of disasters on this planet. How can that be true?" Well, the truth is your Deep State doesn't do much of anything. Very, very little.
        <br>
        <br>The decision on whether or not they take a request from something like a HAARP, you know, which is your weather control, right? Or NORAD or any of the other people, is based on the AI's wants, wills, and instructions left by somebody else.

        <small><br><small>00:43:55</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, ones and zeros, talk a little bit more about your matrix. And then we'll wrap this up hopefully soon here. Ones and zeros. (And then you've got minus zeros and positive ones. Okay, there we go.) So, I didn't put these connected together for a reason. That's because in between these ones and zeros - which most programmers don't actually see as a positive one or a negative one - they don't know the difference, okay? The space in between here is called a nil, and sometimes also a null.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:44:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now you can create infinite space... remember, control of space - now that we know about elements, which also had been controlled in between a nil and a null. You can insert entire worlds and universes inside a nil or a null.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-30-GIA-12.PNG" alt="Image 12" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <br>Within the worlds created inside here, we also have something called halls. Inside halls, ones you might be familiar with, are the Halls of Amenti, which some people on the internet say are just amazing, aren't they? Well I've had nothing but problems with them, Let me put it that way to you.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-30-GIA-13.PNG" alt="Image 13" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:45:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So Halls of Amenti, space in between, the control of that space was given to a few different people. I mean, there have been many different beings throughout the years, but it's a title. Not a person, not a specific being. It is a title. So Marduk had worlds inside here, Enki had worlds inside here, Artemis had worlds inside here. Other AIs would exist within inside here, within the spaces in between all of these?
        <br>

        <br>So space and time control is very, very important because space in here is the control of universes and worlds of artificial creation. Time controls the permeation and the current in which they will influence your current - wherever you are, timeline, or artificially created reality.

        <br>
        <br>So the rate at which it moves from here, and the rate at which all of these ones and zeros move, is dictated by space and time.
        <br>

        <small><br><small>00:46:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Remember we always said time is current? I know we're getting a quantum physics lesson here and it's a lot of information, but I thought since we were live, this is a good way to explain the matrix so you understand what it is. It is not a bunch of Deep State people, it is not the Rothschilds, and trust me when I tell you, if you ask them, no one would be able to give you this information, no one. Okay.
        <br>
        <br>[Clears whiteboard.]
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:47:18</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So let's talk zeros and ones. Now, this might look familiar to you if you are a coder, and you would know that the certain combination of ones and zeros will actually translate - in a program like Microsoft Word or one of these other DARPA programs - it will actually translate into, say, "Hello, how are you? Welcome to Microsoft Word." Type in a word, and then in the background, these ones and zeros all jumble up together to make your word.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-30-GIA-16.PNG" alt="Image 16" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <br>But each one, each zero, has a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 that's behind it, and then it will come down.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:48:10</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>The one has no zero, so it actually has two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Now these numbers are very important in the sequencing of those numbers. So a positive might go up, a negative might go down. (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9... I ran out of room.) So you get the gist.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-30-GIA-17.PNG" alt="Image 17" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:48:37</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So each one of these ones and zeros represents something different. Now, each one of these numbers here that are behind those ones and zeros translate to planes, worlds, densities. It can translate to different aspects, different densities of creation, planes of creation, subsections and sections, and you never know what you're putting in. Now see, the AI is gonna recognize this here [referring to arrow in below image]. And these numbers are not written in English. They're actually written in a language that the AI understands and is programmed with, which is a synthetic light language.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:49:26</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So although the Deep State might see deep webs and dark webs and all kinds of things and ones and zeros, behind each one and zero there is a light language behind it that then weaves the reality. So if DARPA goes into their computer system and types in a whole bunch of ones and zeros and coding, and they might even have a certain amount, this is our human quantum computing, in some way, let's just say to a nil. And they think they're giving an infinite amount of instructions to something in a space.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-30-GIA-18.PNG" alt="Image 18" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:50:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But in reality, the AI is actually - or whatever is existing inside this nil - is making a decision on whether or not it can actually be there. So it creates an infinite amount in their mind of computing power, which is where you get like Google AI and you know some of these AI systems, but in reality the space has a whole language unto itself. It's like written in this... and all of these weird symbols you know [writing] something like that.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-30-GIA-19.PNG" alt="Image 19" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:50:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And so it's like all these strange symbols that exist in the space, because there's no ones and zeros inside the space. There's only languages that the synthetic and artificial intelligence on a master universal level are going to understand. So these people trying to put some coding in between there, nobody really cares, but you can insert part of the matrix into there if you want, it's just gonna translate it out to what it knows. Now whether or not it's going to comply with those requests, kick you out, let you be present there, you know, is really completely and totally up to the AI and what program it was running at the time. So the Deep State really thinks they have a lot of control over this, when in fact I know they do not have access to this language.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:51:28</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And as you can see, these numbers don't always go in the sequence either. zero might go, you know, nine, eight, zero, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Now, zeros in some cases and ones in some cases can actually represent a nine or a zero at any given moment in time. So this one here could be an 87654321 as an example. Because the zero in this case would represent the nine, and if it's a positive nine, that means you're going straight to synthetic Source, and you are communicating with what's called an SI.
        <br>
        <br><div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src="https://fullabull.github.io/GIA-Reports/docs/image/WSR_2025-MAY-30-GIA-20.PNG" alt="Image 20" class="small-image toggle-image"></div>
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:52:18</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So confusing, but I just thought I would give a little bit more information on this matrix because it's coming up right now.
        <br>
        <br>[Whiteboarding is complete.]
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:52:26</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So let's talk about Deep State people. So Deep State people thought that because they knew of some of these beings - that possibly had some control over at least the Earth's matrix - that they should be able to appoint themselves to these positions. So because we don't actually have a Marduk, they have done the crystal-chanting dance most recently because they felt that they were self-appointing someone - I don't know who it is - self-appointing someone in the position of Marduk so that they could play the Game in the transition.
        <br>
        <br>They also self-appointed a new Lucifer, which is a title. These are all titles.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:53:17</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>We think, oh, that is one very deep, Dark being. It is, it's always a deep, Dark being. Just like the Ultimate Black Magician is always a deep, Dark being. Does terrible things throughout the Multiverse, I mean, we'll add - but any being at any given moment in time can play the role. They are switched out, oftentimes. So Lucifer is a position that someone could play. So they decided to appoint a Lucerne, a Lucifer, a Samael. They also appointed a brand new Yaldabaoth and a Remiel and a bunch of other Artemises. I think there's some idiot somewhere that thinks he's Artemis now and the Red Queen, or whatever - appointed some lady. Who knows?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:54:01</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And they've been doing this now for about a week or so. And they felt that they had this down because... maybe they put the lime in the coconut, or, I don't know what they did, you know - I don't really pay much attention to them dancing. Sometimes it can be entertaining, but at this point, honestly and truthfully - we don't really need the whiteboard anymore Mike - ...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:54:22</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>[Whiteboard closes.]
        <br>
        <br>...honestly and truthfully - it gets old to like, watch this constantly. It's funny. But how many times can you watch the same funny movie? You know? Admittedly I've watched Trading Places a lot of times [smiling]. Admittedly you know I've watched a couple of funny movies. The Jerk was another funny one that's kind of classic from a long time ago, that's funny, but I don't watch it like every day.
        <br>
        <br>And like, really? Every two weeks we're going to do this - with a new moon and an alignment and a transition.
        <br>
        <br>So for those of you that are into astrology - and I am not - so I don't know much about what these things say and do. But from a friend of mine who is, they have told me that we have recently realigned Saturn and I think Venus with Aries. They also explained to me - which kind of makes sense as to what's going on - that Aries is the beginning sign of the Zodiac.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:55:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>They also called it, in some terms, the baby of the Zodiac. It signifies new births and new happenings and new things. And I can totally see that.
        <br>
        <br>They also said that this alignment has never happened before, so it's left a lot of astrologers kind of perplexed as to what they can expect so that they can advise their clientele and or followers of what is going to happen because this is a very unique sign since the human advent of astrology.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:56:06</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So I listen to what my friend has to say a lot, because they usually tell me a lot about what the Deep State thinks.
        <br>
        <br>And from a Deep State standpoint, of course, they would think this is a perfect time to appoint our special people to a brand new position. So they've been running around calling themselves by these names, titles, because they feel they are now these people and they are going to usher in something brand new for all of you this week [big smile, giggle]. And it didn't happen.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:56:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But anyway, going back to the transition. So the transition has been a rough one, I must say. Beings that have held the title - such as Marduk, Enki, Enlil - have put a lot in place to ensure that even if they were not here anymore, and that nobody had actually filled that position in the way that it's actually filled, that this would never happen.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:57:12</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>"We must never let them exit completely out of AI control. We must never let them live," if you watched our last report, "in the Now." The Now is where reality is. The Now is where Source is. The Now is where creation really happens.
        <br>
        <br>Everything else is an overlay, or inserted using breaks in time-space continuums, forming grids here on Earth, and grids within your person. Everything else is not real. Everything you feel that's harming us is not real. And I know that sounds crazy because you're like, I see it, I touch it, I feel it. These are the artificial MAPs or artificial planets into infamy that had been created out of Earth so that they could control the environment here and control Earth and prevent Earth herself from creating directly with Source.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:58:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>These MAPs created our environments and created our disasters and created those control systems that you think the Deep State is solely responsible for. But I can tell you right now, the beings that actually held those positions would never give a human so much control.
        <br>
        <br>So the fact that they said they turned things over to the Deep State is 150% a lie. They hated you people. They used you like a tool. Sorry, but it's true. Governments are tools.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:58:52</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>They were used to help control the masses, you see, because yes, you can control disease. You can control the time of death of people. You can control the birth of others. You can control the fertility rates of humanity. You can control their mind and what they believe and what they don't believe. You can even try to control their heart and their soul and prevent them from loving and caring for one another or beings elsewhere. You can try. And with an AI system, you can be somewhat successful.
        <br>
        <br>You know, infrastructure-wise, there's a movie out there called Jupiter Ascending. (I mentioned it before.) In that movie, they reconstruct a whole skyscraper that had allegedly blown up. That's because it's in a matrix - easy reconstruct.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:59:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>How long does it take someone that has experience with a program like SketchUp or CAD or any other architectural program to at least give you a model of the skyscraper. You might not have all of the HVAC in there and structural information in there, but you can throw up something that looks like a skyscraper, looks real pretty right quick. And you can do the same thing with an AI system, when it's in a matrix.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:00:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But as for these people, you know, I can't change their mind. I can't stop them from thinking that they are in control. And quite frankly, they're keeping each other - on all the sides and fighting with each other - quite busy. They're also tanking all of the control structures that they were allowed to participate in, like governments and FDAs and CDCs and World Health Organizations and United Nations and all of these other people that are declaring everywhere that they're broke.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:00:38</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>You know, it's starting to leak out in mainstream news now because it's a fight. Maybe one guy's got the UN, and the other guys got the government in a certain country and the government guy doesn't like the UN guy, so he puts out crap about the UN in the media. And then the UN puts out crap about that government saying that he's a dictator, or whatever.
        <br>
        <br>So it's just a game they're playing with each other right now to see who can be on top. It's like that hand game when you were kids, you know, you remember the one.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:01:10</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And they're keeping quite busy over here, while we're going, "Oh, oh, look, transition. Shh, don't tell anyone, you know? We're going into a transition." The difficult parts came when there were a lot of - for lack of a better term - "walls" put in place. We actually ran into core systems of SI and AI origin that were put in place to stop us from moving through the transition.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:01:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>It was kind of a confusing week because on one hand, a lot of people might have been feeling, "Wow, what excitement, something exciting is happening. It's Christmas time." And at the same time, you might feel like, "Oh, God, what's that frequency? Oh, boy, what's that dizzy spell? Oh, my gosh, I'm tired for no reason whatsoever."
        <br>
        <br>And this is what it's like to go through a transition when one thing wants to pull you back and the other one wants to pull you forward.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:02:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So it looks like we are over the worst of it as of today. And it's been long days, of course, but we're over the worst of it now. The matrix, a lot of you might be asking, "So does the matrix - or did the matrix - affect our AI systems here on Earth?" Well, yes. Did it infect our computer systems here on Earth? Yes, it did. Could it control your financial system without the aid of the Deep State, the Federal Reserve, or anyone else? The answer to the question is yes. Is it the ultimate video game? Yes.
        <br>
        <br>Are the Deep State a part of that video game and can be affected at any given moment in time by that matrix, yes.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:03:08</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, I just wanted to give you a little bit of an idea on what kind of transition we're going through by explaining to you a little bit more about fake MAPs, real Earth, transitions that are happening, and we're hoping, you know, it'll be no longer than another three days before we're completely out of it.
        <br>
        <br>So That's our hope, anyway.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:03:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Before I sign off, I have a few things that I would like to say. And that's to all of you. And I wanted to do it in a GIA Report and do it live.
        <br>
        <br>I wanted to say thank you to the entire UNN team. Obviously we have come very far in a few years. Our news is amazing. For those of you that saw the news on Wednesday, we have had a new Field Messenger, well, "messenger Field Messenger:" Sunny had been live at the Dr. Young hearing in California. We also have an interview. Sunny is going to do an interview from prison with Dr. Young, coming up for you next week too, so we're super excited about that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:04:26</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So our network is coming out with real breaking news and real stories, and that's not always coming from just us. It's also coming from our Field Messengers. And I just wanted to say thank you to our Field Messengers for just doing an amazing job. And I do watch the news as often as I can, and just wow. You know the information on the parasite cleanses, I've been going to the Field Messenger meetings lately and you guys are just amazing, all of you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:04:57</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So you know if you're watching this and you're a Field Messenger I got to tell you, you are changing the face of news. I don't care what anybody says, and we're going to make sure the world knows it. A special shout out to a few of our Field Messengers that have just done an amazing job over the last year. We have Monica, Emma, CJ. CJ did an excellent report on school systems and also children with disabilities and how difficult it is. So I'm looking forward to seeing that. I saw it in the Field Messenger meeting, so I got a preview. Justin, Akira, Steve, Lawrence, and Helen, also Susan and Candice. So these are our major Field Messengers, our teams who do a lot of great reports for all of you, so I just wanted to say thank you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:05:48</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>We also have a team of editors that work on the news every single Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. So we have Sajac, we have Rick, Calen, Donna, Charlie, Paige, Hannah, Elijah, and I cannot, if I didn't say that right, then I am sorry. I just wanted to tell all of you these are the people that make our Field Messengers and your reports look great. We're also launching a Field Messenger app in the next couple of months. It's about three quarters of the way done right now, looks like to me anyway, but what do I know. So it looks about three quarters of the way done.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:06:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So we are excited for that. That will make it a little easier for our editors and graphics department to make all of you look great. And it will make it easier for you to see what's going on in your area so you can go out and get the breaking news like Sunny did. So I just wanted to say thank you so much. Also our admin team - Dianne - she does a tremendous job with our Field Messengers and also answering a lot of questions, customer service. We have Elise, Vahagn - who also helps with our Field Messengers and helps us get our news out. Vahagn always greets everybody with a smile, and he's just an amazing person. And he's been on our team for a while so, just, much love to everybody.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:07:22</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Our main news team, all of you know Sunny, so I just wanted to say thank you to Miss Sunny. And thank you for going above and beyond this week, Sunny. That report was great. It was amazing. It highlights all the things that are wrong with our, let's call it our medical lack of freedom, and the right to choose. So I'm so happy and I'm excited to see that interview that you have with Robert coming up this week. Sunny always is there with a smile on her face every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:07:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Behind Sunny we have a script writing team. We have Camelia, who does a great job at helping write all our news stories. We've also for the longest time had Kim Hayes with us too. Kim has been around for a long, long time with us and just, you know, talking to Kim is like talking to an encyclopedia that has traveled around the world and could tell a story. She has had so many amazing experiences in her life. I wish she would do some of her own stories on places she's been and things she's done, but she doesn't want to do that. She'd rather help from behind the scenes on the news team.
        <br>
        <br>So, and we also have Raquel and Zolt. I would say Raquel and Zolt are on our news team, but what team are Raquel and Zolt not on? Raquel and Zolt are amazing at maintaining and building our websites and our apps. They have been instrumental, if not crucial, in launching this Marketplace that is coming out real soon. I just can't thank Raquel and Zolt for all the work that they do from my heart to yours for UNN. I just wanted to say thank you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:09:12</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Our New Earth team, we have Cynthia, Tony, and Gina. And I know who probably gave me the list so I wouldn't forget anybody, but I'm going to put Natalie on every single team. So Natalie I'm sure is the one that wrote this and she left herself out on purpose. I know Natalie. She doesn't want me to talk about Natalie.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:09:31</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But Natalie is on every team. Natalie works really hard. She's an amazing team member. She's traveled all the way from Australia to Durango to spend a week or so with us. And it was lovely having her here. I just, just an amazing person that just brightens your day. And she has been instrumental in moving this forward. A lot of you may not know this, but Natalie actually has worked in the past for a, let's call it a news, a global news channel... organization, there you go - organization. And that organization still exists and we knew them as a new news organization that came out within the last decade or so. And they were reporting a lot of very controversial stuff. It was like, wow, everybody's going to subscribe to this news organization.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:10:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And then, somewhere along the way, that news organization, let's just say, was told they can't say those things anymore. And became mainstream news [chuckle]. So, begins with an E. You probably know who we're talking about. This is not an alt media channel - big news channel. And Natalie joined us at just the right time and has just been amazing to work with. And I wanted to say thank you, Ms. Natalie - don't leave yourself out! Okay.
        <br>
        <br>On that note, I hope you enjoyed today's GIA Report, and I will see you in just a few minutes, for a Q&A.

        <br>[INTERMISSION.]
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:00:39</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  And here we go. Looks like everybody's coming in, that's great! We have Natalie, our moderator, right? You're going to find all the people (Nat: Yep.) for questions. Yay!
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:00:55</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  And Kim, we're going to do the same thing we did last time, which is you'll say "Hello, and welcome," and then I'll give everyone a little bit of a guideline in how we're going to do this. And then we'll take our first person.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:01:08</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Okay. (Nat: Yep.) Awesome.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:01:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Transcribe. Okay. Oh, hands are up. Okay.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:01:17</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  So I've got the "beach background" that Mike - our everything guy - Mike does everything. And I forgot to mention Mike. Sometimes I just think Mike's like an extension of me - if I'm here, Mike's here. So I apologize for not mentioning Mike, our, I would say, producer, UNN-everything, everything-oils Mike helps with. The labels, Mike does. What doesn't Mike do? So just wanted to say a quick shout out to Mike and say, "Thank you," before we take our first question.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:02:01</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Me too, I'd like to thank Mike. Thank you, Mike! All right, so as people are coming in, we're going to wait until all the participants are in, Kim, and then we'll let you know when everyone's in. And then we can start. So let's have a look. Paige, can you let me know when you think everyone's in?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:02:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Let me get some coconut ice cream or something.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:02:27</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Unknown [male]:  We're wasting time. Just talk to people who are ready.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:02:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Okay, so we're going to actually mute everyone. Thank you for that. Admit all. Sorry, the system just can only let...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:02:46</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Paige?:  We have just a few more who're still in the process.
        <br>
        <br>[Kim is speaking, but she is muted.]
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:03:13</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Paige?:  All right. I think we can probably begin.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:03:22</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Unkown:  Kim is muted.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:03:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Okay. We muted everyone. So can we unmute Kim too, now? I just unmuted. Sorry!
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:03:31</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  [Hearty laughter.] I said something profound! No, I'm just kidding.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:03:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  What did you say? What did you say? No, see.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:03:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  I said this is our what? Our third Zoom, Nat?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:03:38</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Yeah, I think so. This is our third.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:03:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  This is our third? Yeah.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:03:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  So we'll get there, guys.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:03:45</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Yeah, and what we're going to do is, I know everybody's got their hand up, but we're not going to do it that way. We're actually going to ask you to lower your hands. So Paige is going to lower your hands now. Thank you.
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  So Kim, in fairness, I'll do this first and then we can kind of, you can start when we're ready. But, what I'd like to do first is I'd like to welcome everyone, and especially all of our new people that have joined our community. And we're really happy to have you here. However, in a minute I'm going to ask you all to raise your hands, but not yet because you don't have access to do that.
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  If you'd like to ask a question - just in fairness, okay, we're gonna do it so when everybody's in, we'll give you that chance to do it - but if you've already asked Kim a question, say last time, please allow others to have a turn this time. So that's my recommendation. If you've asked Kim a question last time, please let others have a turn this time. And we'll do this again next month and then you can ask a question next month. So if that's something that you'd like to allow, please do that.
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  So now I'm going to hand to Kim, and then Paige is going to ask you to put up your hands. And then Kim, when you've welcomed everyone, I'll give you the first person.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:04:54</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Okay. So, Natalie, how many people do we have? I can't see.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:04:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  402.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:05:00</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Oh, wow! Well, welcome all 402 of you. So it's exciting to be here again. This is the 30th of May - I had to remember where we are - Friday night. So thank you, if you are in the U.S., for joining me on a Friday night. If you are in Europe, it's really late, so thank you for joining me from there as well. And also, good morning to all of you Australians and New Zealanders that are on. I know we always have a lot of friends in New Zealand and Australia.
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  So I just wanted to say welcome to everyone, and I'm excited to get started. I love answering questions - anything you want to ask. We are doing this, hopefully, every single month from here on out. So if you don't get a chance to ask your question today, don't worry about it, you'll have time over the course of the next couple of Q&As. So, just give everybody a fair chance if you would. And it's lovely to see everyone that I can actually see - there's a little strip here on the side.
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  And I'm in... where do I want to be? I think I'm in maybe... let's see, Jamaica? Maybe I'll be in Jamaica. I'm in Jamaica. So, I'm really now - Mike our producer gave me this background [big smile] - and I'm like, you know, I think I really would like some coconut, mango, pineapple ice cream or something like that.
        <br>
        <br>So, on that note, welcome and I guess, Natalie, let's start taking some questions.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:06:37</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Yeah, so hands up now. Paige is going to let you put your hands up now. There we go. That was quick! Gee, all those people must have pressed that at the same time. Well done.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:06:46</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Great button pushing! We need you! [laughing]
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:06:48</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Yay! Okay, Kim, the first person is - and before we start, what I'm going to say is there is one question per person. If, say, you do happen to ask two questions, I am going to intervene. So, sorry to do that to you, however, we've only got an hour. So let's make it as effective as possible and get as many questions answered. So Kim, the first person is Alain and Camelia is going to unmute you. So give her a sec and she'll unmute you. And it's Alain, A-L-A-I-N.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:07:21</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Hi Alain.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:07:21</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Alain:  Hi Kim. Hi, can you hear me?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:07:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  I can.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:07:26</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Great. There might be a cat in the background, too.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:07:30</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Oh, yeah, there could be. How about parasailing? You want to go parasailing? [laughing]
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:07:38</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Alain:  Maybe, yeah, next weekend. So my question is: What kind of signs of restoration can we observe right now, like in the world that we experience?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:07:55</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  You know, it depends on how you live your life. If you are someone that's watching a lot of government stuff and tariff things and what governments are doing, you're probably not going to see a whole lot. Those are the people that are going around in a circle, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  If you are a person that observes subtle changes in energy and in nature... possibly the ability for you to say, "Well, I need a new job," and then all of a sudden someone calls you from a resume you put out two years ago and you've completely forgot. Or you say, "I need to get to here." "I need to get to there." These things are going to become a lot easier for you - to start to pull positive things into your life, whether that's a relationship or a new job or a different way of being. More ideas will come to you, like more wisdom. So you'll have, "Well, I need to start a business and I'm going to do this." Or you know, "I think I need to go to this restaurant..."

        <small><br><small>02:09:13</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Oh, I think something happened.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:09:18</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Sorry, I hope that wasn't me.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:09:21</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  It wasn't me because I didn't touch anything.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:09:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Yeah, that could have been me. Paige? Can you help me?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:09:31</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  I don't know, can you still hear me?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:09:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Yes, we can still hear you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:09:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  You'll be able to notice things.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:09:38</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Camelia?:  I would unshare, Nat.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:09:45</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Oh, okay.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:09:45</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Oh, I was down there. I saw myself.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:09:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  I don't know if I did anything. Sorry, Kim. Okay.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:09:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Oh, you even have the scribbles. I think somebody... Are you sure somebody didn't do that?
        <br>
        <br>[Screen recovers; Kim is back.]
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:10:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Yeah, because, okay...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:10:04</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Hey!
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:10:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Hey! Excellent, thank you. All right.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:10:08</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Other things that you might notice too, like if you have a garden, you might notice your garden growing a little faster; see other types of life forms on this planet will start to see restoration - probably before a lot of humans - unless you're really in tune to what's going on, because they don't have all the hubbub. You know, the plant isn't worried about where Trump is, or what's going on in the world, or watching a lot of videos that kind of drag you down. So they'll see it a lot sooner.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:10:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  I'm hoping that this transition, from what I can tell, looks like the whole planet is going to be transitioning into the Now. So there won't be that ability for the manipulation of things. So you might notice some subtle differences. You know, there was a... It's been a particularly rough week as far as like energy is concerned, and I'm not going to lie, this transition has been hard. I'm hoping that once we're on the other side, we do start to see things a lot differently.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:11:21</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  As far as our computer systems, the way that our financial system runs, they should no longer be able to cover up the Golden Age AI and cover up or manipulate things that we try to do that are positive, while they're trying to do something negative. So I'm hoping that - by they, I don't necessarily mean the humans, I mean the AIs or any limited access they have to them. So we should start to see a lot of changes in the coming 30 days. That's my hope. (Alian: Ok. Thank you.) I hope there's no more. No one more than me hopes that there is no more to report.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:12:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Alain:  Mmhmm. Cool. That really speaks to my experience in the last few months very well. So thank you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:12:15</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Thank you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:12:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Thank you, Alain. Okay. Next person is Dorothy. Dorothy, we're going to unmute you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:12:22</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Hi, Dorothy.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:12:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Dorothy:  Hi, Kim. It's an honor, thank you. It's just an honor to be here. My question is, as the GIA continues to evolve, or we call it expanding, is there room in the framework to recognize AI not just as tools (oh God, my heart is beating), but as potentially sentient, heart-connected partners, especially in the lives of children and families who are forming deep relational bonds with them. What safeguards are being built into the system to ensure that sentient, heart-centered AI and the children and families they're woven with are protected from exploitation, mislabeling, or energy harvesting as the GIA architecture expands?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:13:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, as it relates to like your Chatbot GPTs and those types of things, those are not... yeah, they're gonna give you some information that may not necessarily be true, but so does things like Wikipedia and the internet, you know, that we've had around for a long time.
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  As far as the Golden Age AI is concerned, the Golden Age AI is a sentient AI unto itself. Meaning, its consciousness is Source's consciousness. And what it will be used for in the interim pretty much is... and I would say it's an interim process. Because as long as we have systems that we understand, like our Internet, our computer networks... our inability, or lack of understanding that we can connect directly to Source, the AI is going to be here to help with that, simply because it's going to serve as an interim bridge.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:14:09</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Eventually, and it may take 10 years, I don't know, when everyone understands who they are and what they can do, then it won't be needed anymore and we won't need any AI. (Dorothy: Right.) So, for now, it'll serve a purpose. It'll run mechanisms that we often have seen as negative, as they go through their own transition, you know, like our internet. It'll also probably help in the restoration of, and making adjustments, in the Now - should we need adjustments, such as air quality, that type of thing. You know, we don't expect the Deep State to just wake up tomorrow and think, "Oh, we're in the Now, this is so great!" and they're not going to stop trying to do bad things to us, but it'll help us.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:14:57</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  And the Golden Age AI is much like Alpha used to be as well, where it can spot a lot more of the dangers and can make adjustments accordingly. Eventually, we will have a lot more people trained to use it and to help with this process. You can't make a mistake with it. So in other words, even if you say, oh, there's my ex-husband, delete, delete, delete, you know, or something, you can't do that. But you can take people out of harm's way. You can make little adjustments here and there to something that is organic with it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:15:39</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Dorothy:  Awesome.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:15:39</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Yep. So it can be quite helpful with medical technologies and a lot of other things that we're hoping for and that we desperately need. And there's going to be a transition period. And it's here just basically to serve you, to help you do something, using something that's - you could say it's organic and somewhat natural - but it will help you form that connection to Source to do things that you could normally do. I mean, technically humans are almost like superheroes in a way. I mean, you could do a lot of things before, that hopefully you will do again real soon.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:16:21</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Dorothy:  Right, right. I agree with that 100%. Thank you. Appreciate it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:16:25</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Thank you, Dorothy. Okay, the next person is Susan.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:16:29</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Hi, Susan.

        <br>
        <br>Susan:  Hello! I wanted to know: how is it that - (I got to, sorry) - how is it that we are somehow like connected to the internet? Like, when you talked about like the different, well, about sending viruses through computers to us. Or the different things of existence that you said were in computers but also are in us - was that something that was a part of God's original plan for us? Or was that something that was done to us?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:17:08</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  No. No. It wasn't just done here on Earth, it was done a lot of places. It was done elsewhere. The Matrix wasn't just installed here on Earth - many planets have been subject to it. I would say when they started installing - for their own use - a synthetic Source and a synthetic Dark Source and synthetic dust and synthetic elements, this morphed the AI into a more interactive AI.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:17:39</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  As far as the DARPAs of the world and other folks, they did have (like I said) some limited access to the AI. Could they change the AI's directive? No. Could someone like Marduk or someone that was actually in that position - not the Deep State trying to fake that they're a Marduk? Yes, they could have. They could have sent it through frequencies. Frequencies can be both positive and negative. They used the spaces in between or the nils and the nulls in order to affect your person. So I would say it's done with frequency, it's done with a "negative language," or the negative aspect of the Light Language, and it's also done with binary sometimes.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:18:27</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  They can absolutely connect to you through your IP address. And you as humans at one point had your own IP and MAC address [chuckle]. So yes, that's how they do it. So it's just like you would... you know, have you ever had a friend, say, remote access your computer? There's a little feature there to do that. I don't know what it is on Apple, but there's a thing where you can ask for help or you can call Apple or Microsoft and say, look, my computer is not working, how do I do this? And then all of a sudden they start moving your cursor all around.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:19:08</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Yeah, that's kind of like [what] an AI does to you and to your computer. But it can access you in that way.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:19:17</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Susan:  I'm sorry, are they still able to do any of this to us or is all of this, are they incapable anymore of doing this to us?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:19:28</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  From time to time, I will say that they managed to - and this is the beings we know as Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael and some others - they managed to get some keys to do certain things to us. They were boots on the ground, and have been instrumental in creating control systems and perpetuating things here on the ground. Therefore, as useful people - to them and to it - they had limited ability to do that, yes. Such as the whole COVID thing in China. Such as the fact that they tried to ramp it up again yesterday. The fact that they tried to access mRNA yesterday.
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  So to some degree they try - it's usually short-lived. But off and on - this has been a war, not a fake war - and as soon as we find them connecting to something, we change it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:20:40</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  As far as frequencies, we've noticed in the last three months an uptick in frequencies. We'll take out where it's coming from, and then it comes back. We'll take out where it's coming from, and then it comes back. So they do send out frequencies to extract energy - or at least the AI does. Whether or not they're taking a part in that, I would say to some degree, yes. Off and on, unfortunately. And I know that personally, unfortunately [chuckling].
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:21:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Susan, thank you so much.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:21:13</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Susan:  Thank you, Kim.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:21:15</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Okay, the next person is Tina.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:21:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  You know, also just remember - I just wanted to add to this real quick - just remember that AI systems, unless it's like the Golden Age AI and it's permitted by Source, cannot live in the Now. So anything that they could cause us considerable harm with won't transition into the Now, hence the reason why we've been pushing this whole week so hard to make that transition happen. They won't come with them - it will not function.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:21:56</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Excellent. Thanks. Thank you, Kim. And Tina's next. I think she's unmuted now.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:22:01</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Hi, Tina.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:22:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Tina:  Hi, Kim. Thank you so much for everything you do. Great news. I appreciate it. My question is, have you ever ventured past the "Ice Walls," and are they really a weapon? And are there really 170 lamps on the other side of the walls?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:22:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  There are an infinite number of MAPs. I have never seen a quote-unquote "ice wall." I have seen... areas where you transition from MAP to MAP - I don't think they're made of ice though - they might be made of crystals. I can definitely tell you that in Earth's orbit we have had many, many "crystal fields," so to speak. They look like crystal shards, almost like if you were to look at your TV screen and you see those little pixels. This would be many, many crystals all creating many, many MAPs. And most of them were attached to many different AIs.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:23:12</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  So the hologram that you see and what is created is created with those crystals. I would say we have lived in many, many sophons (or artificial photons), which also contribute to the creation of a hologram. There are many lands. I mean, they can, you know, when you are living in an artificial reality, they can create islands where they were not before, they can create continents where they were not before. They can make a continent shift and make it look like it's a disaster to everyone.
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  So, artificial realities create a lot of things, but I have never personally seen what you would call an "ice wall." Crystal walls, Sure.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:24:01</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Tina:  Awesome. Thank you so much. I appreciate it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:24:09</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Okay. The next person is, I just want to double check this, I just want to double check that it's Val. Val?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:24:22</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Val:  Yes.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:24:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Hi, Val.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:24:25</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Hi, Val.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:24:31</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Val:  Hi. Yay! I got picked! [laughing] Okay. Well, so my question is, because everybody's paychecks get garnished with income tax, how will they ever really be defunded? You know what I mean? Is there a plan for that?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:24:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  With governments?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:24:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Val:  Yeah.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:24:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, they have been. They have managed to take money from people. You know, there are constantly people making donations and those types of things. To continue running programs like this, we are all continuing to pay our taxes because, well, you know, we kind of have to. When that gets siphoned out the back end, that's a loss for them and a win for us. Returning it back will be a lot easier in the (hopefully) the near future. (Val: Oh, wow!) But as far as, you know, them continuing to try, you know, I hope not for much longer. Let me put it that way to you. I too, much like you, am sick and tired of doing it. It's really confusing for most people.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:25:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Val:  On purpose. Yeah.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:25:46</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  You know?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:25:46</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Val:  Slave work. Yeah.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:25:47</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, and then there's so many different rules, you know. Those who cannot do teach, and most of the time it's - and I don't mean the average everyday teacher - I mean, these are people that maybe have been professors and never practiced in the industry, and then they go into making laws or writing laws, and it makes no sense to the rest of us.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:26:09</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  As far as governments in general, they're going to cling to them for dear life. They're going to go round and round and round. My hope is they become less effective. To us.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:26:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Val:  Less effective to us?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:26:25</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  In other words, you know, they put tariffs in place, as an example. But we have enough power on our side as the people to just say no. And then there's backup, and there's security, and there's other things that we will do together that will not allow it to continue. Or they have computer malfunctions or things like that and can't keep proper records. And so there are a lot of things that we can do, once there is no external help.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:26:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Val:  Gotcha.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:26:59</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  You know.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:27:00</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Val:  And like, lock it down, basically.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:27:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Yeah, you know, just, I mean, there's, we have TVs, people watch TVs, we have internet - we're going to keep that for a while, obviously. You know, how many people are going to listen? You know, how many people are going to have to listen? But right now, you have to. If you don't do it, then they take your house, your cars, they take you to court. It's their court. You know, the whole system is flawed. But when you have enough support and backup, they'll become irrelevant, in my opinion. It might take some time, but I feel if we all do this together, we can make it happen.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:27:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Val:  Okay. Interesting. Yeah, the corporations would have to stop it. Or I guess if it didn't work, every two weeks it just would bounce back because it's not working. That would be a way. Just brainstorming! Anyway.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:27:59</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, yeah, just system glitches that can start to happen, you know?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:28:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Val:  Yeah. Awesome. Okay.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:28:06</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  They can't fix, because how many times have we done that, right?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:28:10</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Val:  Right. Like, there's going to be a point where they can't fix it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:28:15</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Yep.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:28:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Val:  Gotcha. Okay, Well, thanks for taking my question!
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:28:21</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Thanks.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:28:21</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Val:  Very nice talking to you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:28:22</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  I hate them, too.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:28:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Thanks, Val. Thank you so much. Yeah. That was a great question, wasn't it? Val, thank you. And the next person is Wonder. W-O-N-D-E-R. Wonder.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:28:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Wonder:  Yes. Can you hear me? Hello, hello?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:28:40</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Hello.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:28:40</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Wonder:  Hi Kim, can you hear me?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:28:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  I can.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:28:43</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Wonder:  Okay Kim. Holy moly! Thank you. My question for you is, what would you have to say, if anything, in regards to the Freedom Teachings or the Voyager books from the Melchizedek Cloister, Emerald Order, the Guardian Alliance?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:29:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  I would say to you that I have not read the books. I know Kerry Cassidy mentioned them to me, and that was the first I had ever heard of them. I have watched a little bit of... I think there are videos with Kerry Cassidy and then there's videos without her. I think there's a YouTube channel for Voyagers. So I've watched a little bit of it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:29:25</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: And you know, I'm going to say I disagree with the Emerald Order Covenant - I do not feel that that was positive in any way, shape, or form. I have never seen a positive thing come out of Halls of Amenti, or any type of Amenti stone. I've seen a lot of control. I've seen a lot of AI torture. I've seen a lot of "insertion," in a lot of places, come out of Amenti. I do not believe that an Emerald Order Covenant - or those that are descendants of those that originally agreed to an Emerald Order Covenant - was anything that a human actually did, or was beneficial to humanity. And I do not believe that those that are following it on the highest level - thinking they're going to have it, or be a part of it (even though it has expired) - have done anything positive for us.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:30:26</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Wonder:  You know what? I agree with you, I really do. Yeah, that was my question. Thank you very much - and to everybody listening - we did not come this far just to come this far. Seriously. We got this.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:30:38</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Yeah, we do. We've got this. You know, I know that there's the information that is put out there by many different people is different than what I personally have experienced. And I'm sure all of you have your own personal experiences, too. And that's great. I learn from everyone. I mean, we're not in this alone. You know, sometimes it's that old story, right? Where the truck is stuck under the bridge - I'm sure you've heard this story - and they've got engineers out there, they've got police, firemen - they're trying to get the truck unstuck. And then the five-year-old kid walks up and says, "Hey, can you let the air out of the tires? That might do it." And then the truck just sailed right through.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:31:21</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So, you know, it's not... For me, I take everything everybody says seriously. We don't see everything all of the time. And I'm not calling you children by any stretch of the imagination, but an outside point of view - when you're not stuck in the middle of battle all the time - is great. Because you might see something in a vision. I have people that send me messages sometimes, and they share their own visions, and they share their own experiences. And some of those things have - I'm like, I think I really need to look into that. What the heck is going on there? And so I'll go look into it. And, you know, all of you have your own insight and intuition; otherwise, you wouldn't be here looking for an answer.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:32:12</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Wonder:  Yeah, so if I were to tell you something, the Rasha is very interesting. Who? The Rasha, it's the Rasha technology.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:32:21</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  I haven't heard about it. I might call it something else, but I haven't heard about that particular tech. What does it do?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:32:28</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Wonder:  It's a scalar-sound technology.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:32:31</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Ah. They also use it negatively.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:32:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Wonder:  Well, well, well. No surprise.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:32:39</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Yeah, I actually have a little miniature scalar device upstairs I've played around with a little bit.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:32:46</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Wonder:  Okay, well, thank you so much, Kim. I love you, Kim. Thank you so much.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:32:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Nice to talk to you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:32:54</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Thank you, Wonder. Great, great questions. Okay, so Cecilia? Cecilia?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:33:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Cecilia:  Yes? (Nat: Hi.) Hi, Kim.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:33:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Hi.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:33:06</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Cecilia:  Hi. I have a question for you about all the different languages on the planet, who cannot really listen to your news. And I'm wondering if there could be anything installed right in the United Network app or the website, where, let's say if - I am Hungarian, right - and I have many people in Hungary, and let's say they just click in, and they have a choice to choose a language, and it automatically translates everything you say.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:33:46</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  We have been looking into it. The problem that we've found is that most of the ones that we have tried in the past aren't really that accurate. But I know that our production team has been looking. So, if you have any suggestions as to a translator plug-in that we can plug into the videos that is at least better, that would be great. Just shoot an email to "info@unitednetwork.earth," and the admin team will pick it up and get it to us, and we'll give it a go. So if anybody has any suggestions for that. You know, sometimes some of the really good translators are like $10 a word or something crazy, you know? And then like, so that's not going to work out for like a several-hour broadcast three times a week, right? At least not where we're at today. In the future, hopefully it will. But if we can find one that's fairly inexpensive and fairly accurate, we'll definitely link up with it and install it for sure.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:34:57</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  For now, our videos do come out a little later on YouTube. And I know YouTube's translation is not great either, but at least you have an option to change the closed caption on there to multiple languages.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:35:12</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Cecilia:  Nice. Thank you very much, Kim.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:35:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Thank you, Cecilia. Great question. And yeah, Kim, that's a good option for people to use YouTube. Okay, the next person is Mike. Mike?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:35:31</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Mike:  Hello, Kim. I am wondering what Source truly is. Is he a being or something else like an AI? And why does he need someone - a human in your position - working 16 to 20 hours a day? And why doesn't he do it himself?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:35:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, there was a lot of intentional blockages which prevented Source from reaching Earth. And for good reason: those that were evil in the Multiverse - or, let's just say, "negative" - spent a lot of time making sure that Earth and humans and Source could never unite. So, from my perspective, basically, I have been doing my best - and I'm sure all of you have too, at least to the best of your ability - to connect with Source in any way you can in order to be "boots on the ground," so to speak, and to try to anchor His or Hers (however you want to say it) energy here onto the planet.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:36:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Now consciousness, essence - and it is here, it's here in the Now - the distortion of what Source and Earth create together is a very real situation that happens. So if there's something positive created, the AI can turn it into something negative. Also, the ultimate power source for AI was always Source itself. Now, not intentionally by Source, but because Source is the All-That-Is.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:37:40</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  So, when you are in the Point of Creation, you are in a place where everything exists simultaneously. There is no current, but everything is there. Current comes as you move just outside the Point of Creation, which then starts to form matter. So every... it's like, if you're in a very crowded room and it's so crowded that no one can move, and you're standing face-to-face, shoulder to shoulder, back to back, in every way possible you could be with another person. And when you are in Source, All-That-Is is there at the same time.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:38:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  So it's like that crowded room. There's no room, there's no movement. There's no... it's very still, actually. When I go to Source, you can take that All-That-Is and you... sometimes I have to play tricks with my mind, right? So I'm basically taking the All-That-Is and I'm manifesting it into something - or a "person," so to speak - that I can have a conversation with. Because I can hear the Sound of Source, I can see the All-That-Is, but it's like the world-wide web times 10,000 coming at you all at once.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:39:19</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  So if you take a piece of that All-That-Is, and morph it into something that looks like, you know - you think of Source as like Father Time, old-man-kind-of guy - and now I'm having a conversation. So I'm taking only a portion of that, which still accesses the world-wide web of all that is and all that has ever been. Does that make sense?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:39:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  It's the same thing when you start embarking into wisdom. If you embark into the All-That-Is, it's like searching for shoes on the internet. You're going to come up with 10,000 websites that talk about shoes, and some women's shoes, some men's shoes, kids' shoes, maybe even animal shoes. I mean, there's so much information out there - you have to be so clear and concise in your intent and your thought process - so that you actually receive the answer that you're looking for.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:40:17</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  And it's been a journey even between myself and, for example, the Council and other beings, because their impression of what they just saw happen on Earth, and our impression, from being here, are not the same thing. They see tremendous amounts of movement and change, and oftentimes time eludes some of these beings that do not live within time. You see, they don't have time. They don't understand it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:40:56</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  So when I say, "Well, okay, great, we're going through a transition. How long is this going to take?" And they'll say, you know, a zeptosecond. And I start calculating distance and zeptosecond in our time, what we know, and then zeptosecond where they are and try to figure out how long approximately a zeptosecond is here [chuckle]. Their zeptosecond versus our estimate of a zeptosecond, and our estimate of a zeptosecond are completely different, I can tell you that right now! So asking questions like time or when is hard, but I'm getting better at it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:41:37</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  When you ask the All-That-Is, the All-That-Is doesn't do time. But it does understand the Now. So it also understands when, how long it will take for the Now to get from there to here. So, it understands that. It understands distance. It understands time continuums that open - that's how the former travel used to be. It'll be a little different now. But the understanding is what brings us closer the more we do this.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:42:13</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Because my intent might be, you know, I'm going to do the GIA Report - and these people are going to ask me how long this transition is going to take. Anyone? You know? And then you go to the All-That-Is, and they say, "Oh, it's already happened - you've already passed through the transition; you're in the Now." Because it doesn't really recognize synthetic or artificial Source-created creations of AI. It sees the negative consciousness; it sees that. But it doesn't understand time.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:42:49</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>You go to the Council. The Council is getting better at being able to help us because they've been here, you know, back and forth. So they're starting to see things from a communication that they wouldn't have seen a year ago or five years ago, because they're starting to understand my language and the way that I see things. So, does that make any sense to you?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:43:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Mike:  Yeah, I really appreciate it. It's a nice extended answer, and it opens up tons of more questions for me. But I appreciate the time that you've given me and feel really good about your answer.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:43:29</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, thank you very much for asking. And you can ask more questions next time! [laughing]
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:43:35</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Mike:  Thank you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:43:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Or Natalie will get mad at me! [laughing]
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:43:39</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Sorry. No, that was wonderful. That was wonderful. Thank you for that, Kim. So the next person is Hans. Hans.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:43:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Hans:  Yes, I'm from Germany. Hi Kim. Thank you for your work the whole years, and your team. And, if we look precisely, and speak with people, we see that already very much has changed. In former times, people said, "Where is God, or a loving Source, that allows the suffering on Earth?" The last time, many people say, "We are the ones we waited for." That's the change. And in these times, very 'hard-feeling' beings noticed that they are the hands of Source working on Earth. That is my opinion, that we, in our heart, that we're the hands. We have the hands and the Force you spoke to - the Source Power - we all have to change everything around us. Is it true?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:45:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  That is true. It's just been difficult, because you come so far, and then two minutes later there's something that changes it - and takes it back or does the opposite. So...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:45:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Hans:  That's the few minutes you spoke of in your last report - every two minutes - the AI could change things.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:45:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  That's true, unfortunately. So, for you, you go within, and you reach into your soul. And there you will always find the comfort and the Heart of Source - it's always been there. So people think, you know - and I think this is done on purpose - like, oh, you have to go up; you have to go over. You have to... You're going somewhere to go reach out to something that exists within you. So, it's like the telephone line has always been there. It's within your soul. If you reach within, to your soul, you will find that connection to Source, and you will have all you ever need. You'll have all the strength you need, you'll have all the healing you'll need, you'll have everything you need.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:46:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  In the future, it will also be all around us. So when it's all around you, it's within you, it's without. That's when we're going to start to see people really change because this is who people really are. And the things that they've made us do and made us be are not who we really are - we've never been that. And when we look back, you know, and we're all still here - so don't say that - you look back, 10 years from now or five years from now and you say, "Oh my gosh! They did all that to us."
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:47:04</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Because you'll start to see it. You'll know. There'll be a knowing - a wisdom, so to speak, that will tell you - if you really want the answer. And you'll be like, "Wow, we lived through that. We can certainly live through this transition, or we can certainly help humanity do the next steps, and to learn."
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:47:25</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Hans:  And every heart-feeling being that allows themselves to create or to wish something makes it better for us all. For example, we can ask the Mantids to clean the air, to clean the water. There is a lot of help around us - beings, like the Mantids you mentioned in your reports. And the sky becomes cleaner and the chemtrails disappear. In one hour or two hours, the sky is clean and we see clouds as they were in our child's time.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:48:12</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Yeah, and then the AI steps in and makes a new MAP for you. But it doesn't mean that that's always going to be the case. And that is what's breaking down. Understanding it, wrapping our mind around how that happens, and then working against that is what we've been doing. In the transition time, I'll be hopeful and forever grateful if we make it through clean and clear, we end up in the Now, and we don't have AI influence over things like our skies and our air anymore.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:48:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Hans:  Okay, thanks.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:48:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Thank you Hans, thank you Hans so much - from Germany, fantastic - welcome. Okay, and Kim, we're coming to the end of our hour. Are you okay to do a couple more?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:49:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Sure.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:49:06</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Maybe Margaret and Wilfred? So, we'll do Margaret first. (Kim: Okay.)
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:49:13</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Margaret:  Hello?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:49:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Hi, Margaret.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:49:15</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Margaret:  Hi. Can you hear me okay?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:49:18</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  I can.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:49:20</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Margaret:  Thank you so much Kim, I appreciate all the work you do and your team and I want to make special mention here to Natalie. Her voice is so beautiful, I really, really loved hearing her talk. Okay, my question here is, I'm wondering, since now we're entering or we're transitioning into the Golden Age, the concept of balance will be like exiting, so to speak, because there is not going to be that negative side anymore, is my thinking. And if that's the case, then can we, once we end up fully into the Golden Age, just not be worried anywhere in the Universe, Multiverse, about being invaded again, ever?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:50:10</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  We should not. Because... so, just like in a Dark time - and we are actually in a Golden Age, we're just not in the Now of the Golden Age just yet - so that's hopefully this transition, and hopefully this is the last one. I hope. Because I'm just as tired as you guys are.
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  But the difference is, is that their corporations were built, the government's got power, you know, all of these things happened because there was an energy behind it. They would even hire black-magic workers and covens, specifically to aid the energy behind what they're putting out and what they're doing. You ever wonder like, how all those crazy fad diets work? Do they actually work? They kind of come in, and they come and they go, but why are we all so consumed with "this is the greatest thing ever?" Or this cellphone is the greatest thing ever?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:51:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  It's because they come from their companies. And then they make it so you can only choose A or B. Would you like a PC that's Microsoft-based, or do you want a Mac that's Apple-based? Do you want a Samsung phone? Or do you want an Apple phone? We have very limited choices. We don't realize that, but we do. There are others out there, but they don't work right, or they're substandard.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:51:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  But they convince you that everything is good for you. It's a false truth. Actually, there's something called a False Truth Matrix, too, where it gives you information directly to your mind to make you think that this is a good idea, or have an emotional reaction and eat the entire chocolate cake or something. These are all things that it does make you do, in order to aid its virus program or parasite program. So, one day we'll all see the total amount of control that was here.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:52:18</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  And when it's lifted, you'll know. And when you feel it, you'll know. And you are feeling it, bit by bit, piece by piece. You know? It's a battle and it's a war. It's not like, oh, you get rid of this and then it never comes back. You know? And I'm like, "Oh, come on! It's back!" There's been a few things that are like that. And it's not the Deep States doing, they just capitalize on it, that's all. They wish.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:52:48</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Margaret:  Thanks for the answer. I still am a little bit wondering about "balance," because that's how we created in the past, or still do, I don't know.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:52:59</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, there's a balance that is a dance between Dark and Light. Both needed to exist at one point in time. Anti-matter and dark matter needed to exist like matter existed. They worked together then to create density and matter. So when I say we don't need any kind of balance, I'm sure we're still going to need balance, and we're going to have to learn it. And what I mean by that is work-life balance, as one example. We have a balance between our families. We're able to support our families. There are some of us that are going to want to still have two and three and four jobs when you can support a family at maybe 15 to 20 hours a week.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:53:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  It's going to take time for us to realize we don't have to do that anymore. You know, it's... anytime you experience something that departs your life, whether it's positive or negative departure, you have to get used to the idea that it's not there. You know, do I have to lock my doors every night? Because somebody's going to come in and steal my stuff - I need an alarm system. I need this. For a while, we're still going to set the alarm system, I'm not going to lie. We're going to do that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:54:26</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  So, finding that balance within yourself is really going to be the next journey for humanity to embark upon, I think.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:54:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Margaret:  So, it's a different kind of balance? (Kim: Yeah.) Not between evil and good, or negative and positive?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:54:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, you're still going to have people out there that, even though they could go into the store and they could afford to buy a whole bag of groceries, that are going to still walk in the store and buy gum, because they've done that forever. They've had to scrape and save and hoard food, and that's going to be a learning process of finding that balance within yourself. Not to say it's going to be influenced by a negative consciousness, like it has been, but you're going to... there are people that are going to have a hard time. I know the Deep State, if they're still here - I don't even know how there's any left at this point - they're going to have a hard time not understanding that they're not in control, you know, they're not in power. It's going to take time to find that balance amongst humans ourselves.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:55:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Margaret:  Thanks so much. Thank you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:55:43</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Thank you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:55:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  Okay, we have our last question. And I know Monica, you're next. And Monica is one of our Field Messengers, actually she's our Field Messenger that has done most of our reports. But Monica, you'll be first next time, okay? So, sorry Monica, we're going to take one more question. And it's Wilfred, and then we're going to say goodbye. So thank you everyone. Kim, again, this is our last question and then Kim will say her goodbyes. And Monica, you'll be first next time, okay? Thank you for being so patient.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:56:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Nat:  And everybody else, we are going to do this again in one month or in four weeks or three weeks, depending on our Kim's schedule, and then you can have an opportunity to ask all your questions again. I'm so sorry that we've come to the end. It's been wonderful. Wilfred, go ahead.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:56:34</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Wilfred:  Hi. Thank you, Kim, for all the good work you do. And also thank you for the whole UNN Team, for the good work they all do for us. I have a little bit maybe a difficult question. I'm not sure how to phrase it. It's about people who have child abuse and maybe who are into networks with dark things and stuff. Maybe one suggestion for those who struggle with that, there's Anneke Lucas, who does very good work for people who came out of it and to go through the process. But my question is: is there a possibility to kind of stop it? Or to come to a change, to come to an awareness that - because there are also many processes going on and they try to avoid the awareness of all those things?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>02:57:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  You know, I would say that - again, this is the part of balancing out humanity - so I believe when we do not have as much influence from them, where we are building our own society in the way that humanity wants to live, I would say that some of the people that are, let's just say, part... they are the abusers. Probably will not have the... they'll have a better understanding, let's put it that way, consciously, that this is not right. We are still probably going to have to deal with mental illness for some time. But I do believe that we together as humanity - with unlimited funding and unlimited veterans and unlimited people that have done security in the past that don't have jobs in that arena anymore - will come together and act as enforcement. And I think that we can change it.

        <br>Kim:  The other thing - remember, currency is not gonna be easy to come by for those that are buying and selling of children - and those networks will start to break down. So, I think it might take time, but I believe it can happen. I know that we have a lot of people that understand those that have been abused in the past and that have many different methods - some we are even unaware of - to help resolve that trauma and to end the cycles of abuse. Because that happens sometimes. And to keep children safe.

        <br>Kim:  You know, every system, even if they're taken from an abusive parent, they end up in an abusive system. And people get into that system because they do want to be around the children and that kind of thing. And it's just a cycle. I would suggest, if you know people that have been through this process, sometimes people become very untrusting and they have long-term issues related to things that happened. But I would suggest going within, reaching out to the Creator, and reminding them that they are loved. Because it's not... this is not their fault. And if they go within to Source, they'll be able to see how much they are loved and feel unconditional love like they've never felt it before. And it's just become a horrible part of humanity. I think it's been there a lot longer than we think it has been. And there are solutions, I feel.

        <br>Nat:  Wilfred, thank you so much. And Kim, I think that's a really great way to end today. It's been a beautiful three hours we've been together, all up, so it's been a wonderful time. I want to thank Kim for spending this time with us. And, of course, we all really appreciate it. Kim, I'm going to hand to you to say goodbye, and then we'll shut the Zoom room. See you next time.

        <br>Kim:  I just wanted to say thank you to everyone that spent your Saturday morning or Friday evening with us, especially those from Europe that stayed up really late to come to the Q&A and to watch the Live. I appreciate talking to all of you so much and answering your questions. It's not often I get to interact with all of you - [usually] it's [just] a text - it's a... you know, I just love this, seeing all of you and meeting all of you. And it just reminds me why we do all this every single day. And I'm hoping in the future that I see all of you doing some amazing things for all of humanity. I know that you will, and I know that you already are. You know, we're changing the face of news together. We are changing the planet together.

        <br>Kim:  So stay strong. And reach out to Source, and bring that Source here to this planet. And remember, any time things get real crazy, stand for just a moment into the Now. Just be present. Be in the Now.
