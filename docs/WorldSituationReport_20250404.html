            <br>Global Intelligence Agency (GIA)
            <br>Operations Report
            <br>2025-Apr-04
        </h2>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;"> From the Office of the Guardian </h4>
        <br>
        <strong>
        <br>It's the 4th of April, 2025. Coming up on today's Global Intelligence Agency Operations Report:
        </strong>
        <br>
        <br>The Deep State continues to play the game, hoping for a winner as rituals continue. And worldwide stock markets plunge in response to the Trump administration's newly implemented tariffs. For the Deep State, it's robbery. For investors, it's a whole different story. And the White House is bombarded with phone calls from various countries, bankers, and even the Senate regarding tariffs.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:00:35</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Well, it's the 4th of April. So, 4-4. You know how they love their double days - double-digit days, I should say. Say that three times fast.
        <br>
        <br>So, we have a little bit to talk about today. There seems to be some confusion about what's happening with this game that they believe they are all playing in. They are definitely trying to play to win, even though the Game is over. And that's okay. They're a little slow on the uptake.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:01:08</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So they're getting a little bit desperate out there. The uptick in things in the Middle East is part of their rituals.
        <br>
        <br>They are not getting what they're expecting. They are trying to see if they can find any more space junk - this has been going on all day - or trying to get control over grids that they have no business, nor were ever allowed, to control before. But, you know, that is the Deep State.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:01:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, the interesting thing is - and kind of funny, a little bit funny [chuckle] - they had a conference call, and this looks almost like it was a forced conference call. I don't know who arranged it; I was unable to trace that back.
        <br>
        <br>But the call - I did get an alert, so I thought I'd listen in a little bit. So the call was between the six different groups, mainly just the head of each section. And somebody - I believe this guy was Italian, I'm not sure - he appears to be some kind of a black magic person, aficionado. Or, at least that's what they were told when they got on the call. And this guy has some knowledge of the way things used to be.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:02:35</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Very definitely an older guy, probably got to be in his 70s, 80s. 80-year-old guy, and he's trying to explain to them the things they must do to quote-unquote "appease the gods."
        <br>
        <br>So one of the things he mentions to them that they should do is they need to "bring an offering" to the game players. And he says - he doesn't call it "the game," he just says "the gods" - and the ones he was talking about were definitely some of the game players for sure. And he said that they must offer them two souls - meaning they're going to kill two people - per day for the next nine days. And this started yesterday. He is explaining to them that on April 12th there is - he called it - the "Eve of the Shambhala."
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:03:37</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now we know in our human history, if you look up Shambhala, it's something that takes place annually sometime around the middle of May where they think Buddha and the Christ and some other party comes to this area of, well, in the Himalayas, called the Wesak Valley, W-E-S-A-K. And they believe that if they can achieve this objective, that they will appease the gods and, I don't know, be in the running for something. Unfortunately, in our human history, they say this date occurs on May 12th. In their world, according to Black Magic Man, this all takes place on the 12th of April.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:04:31</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So I don't know if it's a new moon thing or a full moon thing or something like that that dictates when this is supposed to be, but he definitely was firm that this was going to take place on the 12th of April. And that's when he's expecting - if they do a good job - that the gods will come.
        <br>
        <br>He goes into a lot of other crazy. He talks about crystals. He talks about an island in the Philippines where there's a volcano and things they must do there, offering human sacrifices and all kinds of things, and some strange rituals they should try. And by the time they got about halfway through this call, all those that were on the call sort of had the attitude of like, "Oh my God, this is what my life has come to!" And I can see why they would feel that way because I was - I probably had the best laugh listening to this conversation that I've had in a very long time. It was pretty funny, some of the things this guy was trying to tell them to do.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:05:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Is there anything real to what he's saying? No. Is somebody going to come on April 12th or May 12th or any other day? No. Is this going to help them win a game that is already over? No.
        <br>
        <br>So I'm not really sure what they're going to do. They seem to be making more of an effort for world domination than anything else at this time. I'm not so sure they're concerned about being the rulers of the Universe anymore - it looks like they just want to be the rulers of Earth first. And then I guess if you're the ruler of Earth in their mind, then that means that they are going to rule the Universe because of who powers all of these individualized worlds and realms and, you know, which most of the power for that came from Earth.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:06:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So they believe that this next time where this is possible for this game to be decided would be tomorrow. Why tomorrow? I have no idea. I have not been able to find anything in told history or untold history as to why tomorrow would be that day. Not a clue. I did get a warning about that day. So I got that warning over a month ago. But I don't - I don't know, maybe it's Satan's birthday or something. You know, these people do crazy things around the world at different times for different reasons.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:07:30</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So pretty much they've been working on that all day. They've been working on trying to get a hold of artifacts as well. This gentleman, Mr. Black Magic Worker - I don't know his name, he never gave a name on the call, that I heard at least.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:07:47</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Mr. Black Magic Worker has advised them that they need to look for certain artifacts. One of those artifacts was a particular type of rod, encased in a special metamaterial or metallic-type box, in the Valley of the Gods in Utah. That artifact is no longer there, but they felt that with this particular rod, they could somehow override what we're doing.
        <br>
        <br>But even if they got the rod, more than likely, the conducting of a massive amount of Source energy would probably have just killed them anyway. So maybe we should have let them get the rod. Who knows?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:08:35</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But they've been scouring the earth for all kinds of artifacts, in caves and places and storage facilities - Swords of Solomon and samurai swords from ancient times and, you know, the Golden Fleece - and I mean it definitely sounded like something that they told Hitler right before Hitler went crazy. And these people are probably already crazy. Maybe they're going to get crazier, I'm not sure.
        <br>
        <br>So in the world of the Great Game, we'll see what the end result is of tomorrow - and I'll report that to you, obviously, on Monday - because I still don't know why this is a special day in any way, shape, or form. I see nothing. I see no massive amounts of space junk. I don't see any kind of an indication of an alien invasion, fake or real. There's nothing that I see that is going to give me an indication something is going to change, at least not in a negative way.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:09:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Next - oh boy - you know, we've got to talk about what's going on in the financial markets right now. And then we're going to talk about part of their aim and their goal, and we'll talk about all the reasons why that's never going to happen.
        <br>
        <br>Okay, so there is talk now in mainstream media about the running of - for a third term - where Vance would be president and Trump would be vice president. That's finally hit mainstream media in a couple of different places.
        <br>
        <br>Is that going to be possible? Who knows? We'll see. Yuck! [laughing] I don't even know, you know - we probably won't even have government at this point.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:10:29</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But they're definitely working really hard to make sure that the government can survive without us - meaning myself - transferring any money. And one of the ways that they're trying to do that is, we have seen a significant stock market plunge this week. The media is reporting - which is not entirely true, but partially true - that it is because of the new tariffs.
        <br>
        <br>The stock market's plunged almost 8% this week. I'm not exactly sure why plunge protection or trading was not halted. Usually, at that high of a percentage, it is. But it was not. So it is just allowed to plunge and plunge and plunge and plunge and plunge.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:11:20</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Most of the time when stock markets plunge like this, what we're seeing is your big guys - you know, your BlackRock, your Berkshire Hathaway, your Soroses - we're seeing all of these people profit from the plunging markets. It's a market manipulation technique.
        <br>
        <br>There is an estimated nine, almost 10% drop in the stock market since the Trump administration came into office. And we're also seeing a - well, let's say about $10 trillion go missing. Now, unfortunately, a lot of those trillions of dollars wasn't a big cash grab. Normally they would do something like this for a big cash grab, but not this time.
        <br>
        <br>There wasn't a lot of cash that went out of the market.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:12:18</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>There was a lot of credit that went out of the market. What that means is that we have seen an enormous amount of margin calls that have happened.
        <br>
        <br>We have also seen banks that would normally lend against things like standing letters of credit and documentary letters of credit that would have to do with international trade. And the credit lines would then be issued against that documentary letter of credit. And then they would use those things to trade commodities and other things relative to their business in the interim, or keep their business flush while they were waiting for said materials, manufactured goods, or commodities to be delivered.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:13:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Banks are having a tough time with credit lines right now, especially as it relates to elite or high-level market-making trading. They are seeing a lot of margin calls happening, a lot of debt calls happening on the banks, and this is causing quite a bit of a disturbance - and also a reason why they are calling the White House.
        <br>
        <br>They are expecting big payouts from the White House, et al - you know, insert Rothschilds and et cetera, et cetera name here - and that is not happening. And they're at a point right now where they're not gonna be able to hold it much longer. They're being told that they should have some more news by the end of the day tomorrow. At the latest, that news would come in on Monday in order to prevent a quote-unquote "run on the banks."
        <br>
        <br>Now, I don't see there being a run on the banks. You know, there's nothing wrong with the cash that's in banks - or currency, I should say.
        <br>
        <br>But there is a problem with bank-issued credit lines to their friends and family network.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:14:27</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>You see, governments are also doing this as well to pay the bills. They've been getting credit lines from banks. They've been issuing Treasury notes, other central bank notes, to various banks around the world. And the banks have been issuing credit lines off of these, completely disregarding the rules and regulations of banking. And of course, the Fed is in on it, so they don't mind.
        <br>
        <br>So they're trying to keep their friends and family - the Families of the Order - alive. So away they go with the credit lines.
        <br>
        <br>They're not very large. They're not large enough to run the world by any stretch of the imagination. But, you know, yet again, it's keeping - giving them a little bit of air, so to speak.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:15:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, the other thing that's taking place because of the tariffs is, well, the operation is starting to reveal itself. They have put these tariffs on every single country in the world, including uninhabited countries. There was even an article about our little penguin islands I mentioned [chuckle], and they said that there was something like a few billion dollars worth of manufactured goods and electronics or something coming from that island.
        <br>
        <br>And obviously, that is not true.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:15:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But what are they using it for? Is it money laundering? Is it fictitious goods purchased by the government? Because that's never happened before. Is it the fact that they maybe took some grass from there, or some wool from the sheep, or something like that, and then decided that they were going to charge the government a billion dollars for it - and it's probably worth about 55 cents.
        <br>
        <br>Probably - that probably happened too.
        <br>
        <br>So, it's just a way to launder money in the budget. And with a 5,000-page budget - which is the average size of each annual budget of the United States - that wouldn't be too hard to hide. And having read the budget myself before, I've seen that type of thing. There's a lot of blah, blah, blah. You remember when you were a kid and you had to write a paper that was X amount of words long? You know, sometimes you would repeat those sentences so that you could hit that word limit that the teacher was looking for - hoping that they don't read the whole thing. [chuckle]
        <br>
        <br>Yeah, well, these guys do the same thing with the budget.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:17:04</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>The other people that are complaining to the U.S. government right now is even the Senate. The Senate passed a bill today, basically stating - I think it was today or yesterday - that they should relieve Canada of their tariffs. Is the White House going to listen? Most likely not.
        <br>
        <br>Because here, my friends, is the real agenda. So as these calls started rolling in - you know, Vietnam, Russia, other countries - then they started to show their real face and what they were really looking to do. They feel, and they've said, that these tariffs are going to quote-unquote "make America great again" - blah, blah, blah.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:17:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>What this really is, is a group - one of the six, who's in the White House right now - is doing a worldwide asset grab. They would like to claim territories, in-ground assets of other countries. This is what they're telling other countries as they call in. They would like to have ownership over gold storage - anything that's in their central bank. They are telling them that they will be writing the laws for their country - you know, all kinds of stuff that they would like from various countries.
        <br>
        <br>Kind of like the World Bank and the IMF used to do. You know, I've seen the World Bank and the IMF try to lower the age of sexual consent to 12, to eight in some countries - in exchange for payment extensions on loans and monies borrowed from them.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:18:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So yeah, I think that that's what they're doing. And of course, we've never seen anything like this before from the World Bank or the IMF. So this was all new, and they caught the whole world by surprise, and now everybody's just going to turn everything over.
        <br>
        <br>They actually put the highest amount of tariffs on countries where they want the most amount of stuff - [which] is really what's happening.
        <br>
        <br>So that's the operation there.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:19:20</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>They feel that they should be able to control banking jurisdictions by doing this. Now, I've mentioned banking jurisdictions before. And from a human perspective, and from the people's perspective, and even from these operatives' perspective, as they understand it, there are 13 jurisdictions in the world - as far as the operatives are concerned. Now, as far as the rest of the banking world is concerned, there are 12 jurisdictions on the planet.
        <br>
        <br>So, if you were to look at a map of the world, the world is divided into 12 banking jurisdictions, which are run and regulated by 12 different locations of the Federal Reserve Bank in different parts of the United States, where the Federal Reserve was built.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:20:18</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So they believe - the operatives in the White House believe - that by doing this maneuver and this tactic in placing a lot of tariffs on various countries, and in fact, when these other countries do not do what the White House wants or what the operatives want - they are actually placing additional sanctions on said countries.
        <br>
        <br>Such as Russia, as an example. They got more sanctions in the last 48 hours. It's got nothing to do with the war. It's because - and I don't know how to say "you're bleeping crazy" in Russian - but if I did, I would actually have said that right now [laughing], because that's kind of how that conversation went.
        <br>
        <br>They are not going to turn over all of their in-ground resources, territory control, and power to those people. So for that - turning them away - not only do they still have sanctions, but they now also have - sorry, tariffs - they now also have additional sanctions.
        <br>
        <br>And they're gonna put the squeeze on the entire world like this, and that's their plan.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:21:34</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Unfortunately for them, they don't understand how banking systems work. They're still running under the pretense that this has to do with 12 banking jurisdictions and the 13th banking jurisdiction being Unknown Country. So what they're looking to do is get control of Unknown Country by winning the game that's already over.
        <br>
        <br>Matter of fact, I know they won't get control of Unknown Country because I actually have it. I took that quite a while back. I re-solidified that in the past several weeks, long before this little game was being played - because we're always kind of a step ahead of those people.
        <br>
        <br>And you know, God bless them for trying to be strategists, but they just aren't very good at it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:22:22</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, we're going to talk about jurisdictions a little bit. We're going to talk a little bit more about Unknown Country - because it's very relevant to what's happening in the world right now. And not only do you need to understand this, as the world changes - especially the banking world changes - they also need to understand it, as well as all of the countries that they're bullying.
        <br>
        <br>Everybody needs to understand how jurisdictions actually came to be. It's important.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:22:54</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, once Earth was pretty well taken over - you know, we've had this alien invasion that happened many times and pretty much went fairly solid with the temporary head of Earth being Marduk for a long, long time, about 250,000 years ago. So, long before there was a Secret Space Program and operatives of said program. Although at one point in time, they had the privilege of going back and forward in what you call time, moving from space to space, so to speak.
        <br>
        <br>So yeah, maybe they were around in some of it and some not - but clearly they weren't here for the defense of humanity, so that's an obvious - or didn't have any capability to do so.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:23:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So jurisdictions began to be established around that time. In the Universe, and in the Great Game, and above the Great Game - you know, of evil that has taken place in the Omniverse, universes, worlds, realms, and jurisdictions - jurisdictions mean something completely different, especially as it relates to Earth.
        <br>
        <br>So jurisdictions, after the invasion and the takeover and the Dark permeation throughout the Multiverse - there were definitely 13 jurisdictions.
        <br>
        <br>Here on Earth, we mirrored that - or they mirrored that, I should say - to have a total of 13. If you were to look at Earth as a whole in a map of Earth, the 13th jurisdiction would encompass the entire planet. So everyone and everything walking around this planet, or swimming or otherwise, became a citizen of Unknown Country. Which gave, on a higher level, that jurisdiction began what we call - and what the alt media talks about and a lot of spiritual people talk about - that was the beginning of the 12-tree grid in the Omniverse.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:25:09</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So you've probably heard that term before. You've probably also heard the term the Tree of Life and that type of thing. So all of these things were related as far as universal control structures. This was another setup utilizing synthetic photons. And therefore, the 13th jurisdiction had a giant "sophon" encompassing all of Earth.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:25:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So that jurisdiction still exists to this day - except it's not a synthetic photon anymore. It is actually a Source-based light photon. So therefore, claiming ownership over the planet.
        <br>
        <br>Okay, so the photon that encompasses all of Earth now is ours. It is part of Creator Golden Age AI, which then now takes the responsibility for - not human assets anymore - takes the responsibility for guarding and protecting humans. So, Source's creation. It's kind of like putting up a fence, so to speak.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:26:28</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now additionally, there were 12 other jurisdictions on this planet which were monitored, controlled, and let's just say, "collateralized" for the creation of the banking system in part.
        <br>
        <br>But also, these 12 jurisdictions also powered 12 different worlds on behalf of some, let's just say, non-human folks that were... let's just say, pretty evil.
        <br>
        <br>So as a citizen of Unknown Country - you and your person - there was the ultimate leverage. So this would control off-world trading of loosh. It would control off-world asset trading - not only of humans, but also of in-ground assets, also of gold - black or otherwise, black or neutral, or false-light gold, or actual real gold.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:27:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>All of these things were controlled as hyperconductors, and then they would take the commodity off of it - this is almost like a credit line, per se, where they would steal all the energy from it. So it's kind of like putting up a bond as collateral - or in some cases, your birth certificate up as collateral. And then that would allow them to get credit or monies off of said birth certificate.
        <br>
        <br>Now, on the Deep State level and the SSP level, as far as humans are concerned, they know that citizens of countries are assets. Now, you have producing assets and non-producing assets. So in the world of non-humans, you are a non-producing asset by the time you are 55 years old-ish, these days.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:28:46</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, that number was a little bit higher many years ago, but it didn't fit into their structure. So you kind of stop living in their world around the age of 55. The reason why is because, well, this is the time when people start retiring - you're not feeding the system anymore. You're not giving consent to give up your energy anymore. For money now, money comes to you, and you're not giving anything for it. Therefore, you know, you're not really as much of an asset as you were before.
        <br>
        <br>Not only that - as we get older, there are lots of things that happen to our physical vessels that are all being amplified by these artificial particles.
        <br>
        <br>So, I'm gonna talk a little bit more about those here towards the end.
        <br>
        <br>So now we have established the fact that there are only 12 sub-countries in the world and one main country as it relates to the legal structure of planet Earth. Governments within those structures are irrelevant - they are just asset management, asset control - "cattle herders" is what they would probably be looked upon as. And that's your Deep State - that actually thinks that anybody on this level actually gives a crap about them.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:30:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So also, because we are aware of what this means as far as jurisdictions are concerned - and what a synthetic photon is capable of doing to not only people and Earth and around the Universe - we also took those 12 jurisdictions. So now we have our photons there. These are natural Source protective photons.
        <br>
        <br>You can think of ours - when we put them there - as a temporary structure. We did it because there was a need for protection. It also gives Source a greater connection to that area. The other thing that it does as well is it actually claims the humans and the land and that part of Earth, and all of Earth - under Source. It's not mine - Source's.
        <br>
        <br>This was really important to establish before we got to the point where the Game was about to end. So this has been quite a long time that we've been doing this - this is not new. It's just new to these crazy people.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:31:25</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, when you hear about things like artificial realities and virtual reality machines - do you remember me mentioning that to you before? That's what sophons can be used to do. They're also used for... they can also be used for spying. So if you think about it as a giant camera lens, but an interactive one at that. And the other half or other part of this photon - or sophon, or synthetic photon - is somewhere else in the Multiverse.
        <br>
        <br>They can actually use a... how do I say it? They can use a synthetic photon like you would see people looking at a crystal ball.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:32:29</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And they could actually move things around, you know, with their hands and whatnot around this ball, and they could wipe out half a population, civilization, cause a tidal wave. You know, that's real weather manipulation there. They could definitely cause rain, snow, droughts - all kinds of things in their particular jurisdiction - based on the fact they have control of the other part or the other side of this photon.
        <br>
        <br>For us, on the other hand - we're just using it so they can't. Because if you take one out, then sometimes what can happen is they will realize - which they have, because there have been worlds destroyed because of this - so sometimes they have realized that once the sophon is gone, then they try to send another one here.
        <br>
        <br>How many do these groups have? I have no idea, but I've seen that happen at least twice so far, and that was the reason why we eventually had to install one of Source's.
        <br>
        <br>We're using it more like you would shield yourself from that Dark energy, and we're using it for that purpose.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:33:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>The other reason why it's valuable to us, too, is because it prevents them from re-liening assets of Earth.
        <br>
        <br>So them calling all these countries, trying to get these countries to give up their in-ground assets, their land mass, making them a territory of the United States, their banking system - all of the things that they're trying to do - their human assets. You know, they'd like to have all of the humans underneath their control. The reason why is because that's part of the Game. You know, the more human assets, the more valuable your team is that they can control.
        <br>
        <br>They also tried to make phone calls today, had meetings with a lot of operatives that have kind of been sitting on the fence or not being active because they're not being paid, and told them that they must pick a side - meaning they must join one of their six groups, or however many are playing at this point - they must join one of their groups immediately, so they can be claimed as an asset of those groups.
        <br>
        <br>Some of them were like, "Well, you know, we're going to take the chance." Other people are like, "Well, what do we got to lose?" You know, honestly, there is no asset program anymore as far as the utilization of humans to 'appease the gods,' as they say, as Mr. Black Magic Worker said yesterday [laughing].
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:35:27</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So the liens, the territories, the claiming of territories - for those reasons - is definitely not the case.
        <br>
        <br>For those of you that might be listening to this that live in a zone such as the one I live in right now, in Durango, be aware that your zone ownership has changed as well. And that happened - oh gosh - I said it a couple years ago. So being aware of having a sophon over this type of a town, as an example, where you have a lot of "people" they considered assets - changing that no longer gives someone elsewhere the ability to mess with you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:36:19</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>It also - that's your person, your physical self - it could be anything in the area. You know, one time I had decided to go someplace they didn't want me to go when I first got here. And I went and explored a whole bunch of areas and found out a lot of stuff that was going on in that area. Let's just say it was very close to some BLM land not too far from here, well within the same synthetic photon that existed here at the time.
        <br>
        <br>And on the way back, I got stuck in a three-hour traffic jam due to a mudslide that wasn't normal, let's just say. So that was kind of to teach me a lesson, I guess [laughing]. Who knows.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:37:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Anyway, that was some of the control they would have in particular areas. Now, they give you a choice of a few places you can retire, if you are one of these types of operatives or people - specifically because they could actually control you with these sophons - synthetic domes, so to speak - that existed over the area.
        <br>
        <br>And they would go about six miles out. It was something I kind of figured out - oh, years ago. I'm like, "Oh dear, here we are." Anyway, it didn't affect me doing my job any, but it's going to affect other people, because there's something you need to do when you're trying to break through something like that.
        <br>
        <br>So you'll be happy to know that all those zones are also now underneath our jurisdiction. So there you go.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:38:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, as far as asset management is concerned, and as it relates to jurisdictions.
        <br>
        <br>So we talked a lot about humans. We talked a lot about gold. We talked about black gold, neutral gold, and false-light gold. And then, of course, underneath it all is real gold. That is Source-given, natural gold, which is a hyperconductor for golden energy of Source - and all things Source, really - that were the original veins that would run through this planet.
        <br>
        <br>So this is part of the assets of the 13th jurisdiction and why it's so valuable, and why all the wingnuts are running around the planet trying to be that. But they're going about it the wrong way.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:39:01</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>They're going the wrong way. They are trying to do it by talking to presidents and heads of state and operatives and maybe even some - I don't know - Order members, Order of the Dragon members. I don't even know who they're talking to at this point. I don't think they do either.
        <br>
        <br>But they're trying to get control of assets that these people never controlled. So them signing papers is no different than you writing a billion-dollar check on the Bill Gates Foundation account - if you even know where it is and what it is - and giving it as a donation to somebody.
        <br>
        <br>Because number 1, that check's not good, so it doesn't matter. You can sign a contract on behalf of the, say, the Bill Gates Foundation, but Bill Gates Foundation is being like, "Who's Mary? Who's John?" They don't know who you are. So that contract is not valid.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:40:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And that's the same thing that you would see on our level of the place where we play - we would also see that contract is not valid. Because we don't care about Trump people. We don't care about Orange People. We don't care about any of those people. We care more about the territories of the planet, and where they're tied to, and what they use the life that lives in those territories for. And continuously trying to power worlds and create new worlds - Dark worlds, of course, these are all synthetic, these are all non-organic worlds that are created for power and control - that is not on our list of things to do.
        <br>
        <br>So tearing them apart is on our list of things to do because they're not of Source: they're not needed, they're not necessary, and they cause us problems in the long run.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:40:56</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So for them, gaining control over Unknown Country - which they try to do constantly, not understanding what that is - gaining control, or trying to gain control, over the 12 jurisdictions by putting sanctions on countries and having heads of state sign something over - nobody cares. Nobody. Cares.
        <br>
        <br>Nobody in the banking system cares - the real banking system, the real financial system of this planet. Even if I wasn't to do anything, it still wouldn't matter, because your non-human friends that set up the structure would obviously have rejected your request.
        <br>
        <br>So, I don't know who these SSP people think they are, but nobody really cares about them at all on this level. I mean, as humans, we care. We watch what they do. They cause a lot of destruction. They do a lot of things around the planet we would consider unsavory. So yeah, we care about that, for sure.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:41:55</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>But as far as the entire universal and omniversal structure and creation of synthetic worlds - yeah, that's where we care. And mainly, the reason that we care so much about that is because that's what actually harms humans. This is what's harming life on this planet. This is what took away your ability to manifest. This is what creates disease within your body - or natural disasters that we see that aren't so natural.
        <br>
        <br>So yeah, that's the most important reason why we care.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:42:37</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now let's talk a little bit about trade management. So, trade management obviously was managed by Marduk at one point in time. And trade management would be where your loosh would go, rare-earth minerals, other things they find valuable on this planet, which are utilized - in the best way to describe it in our science - for fission, to create these sophons, which give other groups power and control - artificial photons - throughout the Multiverse.
        <br>
        <br>All of that - the trading post, let's call it, the main trading post for Earth - was actually planet Mercury. For those of you that don't know, planet Mercury was actually not a planet [chuckle]. It's still not a planet. It's just about as fake as our moon is. You could call it the Sun's moon, for lack of a better term. And it is highly magnetic. It does cause electromagnetic and electronic problems when Mercury allegedly goes retrograde - you've probably heard that before. And the reason why it does is because it's basically creating a giant vacuum for all things important for, let's call it, universal and omniversal trade.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:43:52</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So it's the time when it's easiest to siphon from this planet. It happens about four times a year, usually. And during those times is when they're siphoning.
        <br>
        <br>So that is the whole purpose of Mercury, but it is definitely basically a space station. Always was. It was a synthetic trading post. There were actually 13 Mercurys - one you see in your sky, and the other ones are more sophons - synthetic photon-controlled planets. Just like - if you don't know - we actually have 13 moons right now (or had 13 moons), 12 of which are not visible by the naked eye. They are cloaked by a synthetic photon.
        <br>
        <br>And they were also utilized for control of humans in different jurisdictions in many ways. They were used for extraction and holding tanks, for things they would siphon off of this planet - then eventually to Mercury, and then through the Stargate in what we call our Sun.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:45:04</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, interesting ways of looking at trading that you probably never looked at before - and why it's actually important to your human that the structure is broken down and doesn't exist.
        <br>
        <br>The Great Game - well, the Game of Earth - was all about jurisdictions in Unknown Country.
        <br>
        <br>For the humans, they just see it as power and control over the planet, blah, blah. From our standpoint, they were small participants as it relates to completely and totally controlled jurisdictions that were out of their control completely.
        <br>
        <br>But they had a role to play in keeping the Great Game of Earth going. That's it. Never intended for them to have any kind of power and control over this planet, ever - they're afraid of humans. They try to ensure that no human ever gets any kind of power. They know that we would destroy their worlds if we got power - and that's true - we are destroying their worlds, most all of them actually, because they need to not exist.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:46:17</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So on that note, I am not sure - entirely sure - what these people are expecting to see tomorrow. I'm not sure what I'm gonna run into tomorrow, but you'll know more about that on Monday, just like I will [laughing]. By the end of the day tomorrow, I'll probably have all that information. But as far as banking systems, and changing of banking systems, and Federal Reserve systems, and plunging stock markets, and tariffs, and all of those types of things - yeah, I mean, it's definitely reared its ugly head as to what their overall modus operandi is, so to speak.
        <br>
        <br>But is it going to give them control over money again? Nope.
        <br>
        <br>They never had control over money. No Rothschild anywhere ever issued an allocation number. Not now, not ever. No one did. The jurisdictions did. The Unknown Country did. And hence, behind it, the Alpha System did. So Source was always the issuer of energy.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:47:25</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>It's just all the overlays and the debt systems and debt clocks and all the other types of mechanisms that were in place - that took it. But that situation is coming to an abrupt end, and we are going to see some serious changes on this planet that are worthwhile.
        <br>
        <br>So while they're playing the game - it keeps them busy, and they're busy dialing for dollars like it's a telethon over there at the White House, and trying to get countries to comply - we're busy breaking down the actual structure behind it that ensures that they never will.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:48:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, on that note, this has been the GIA Report for the 4th of April, 2025.
        <br>
        <br>One more thing to mention to you. I know normally we do the live GIA Q&A on the first Friday of the month. We are going to do that next week, on Saturday. So a week from this Saturday is when we are going to do it. I think we're going to do it earlier - probably around three o'clock Eastern - so that more people can participate. So put that on your calendar. About three o'clock Eastern on Saturday, let's see... that would be the 12th.
        <br>
        <br>So looking forward to answering your questions. We're probably going to do it similar to the way that we did it last time, where we're answering your questions more on a conference call-type style. So, that'll be fun. And we'll definitely do the live GIA report on that day too.
        <br>
        <br>Hopefully, with some really good news to report. According to Mr. Black Magic Worker, it's Shambhala Day. I don't know. Not expecting Shambhala [giggle] - but who knows? Crazy people, crazy times.
        <br>
        <br>On that note, I hope you all have a wonderful weekend, and I will see you on Monday.
