        </h2>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;"> From the Office of the Guardian </h4>
        <br>
        <strong>
        <br>George: Good evening everyone, and welcome to Patreon, The Reveal Report. This is the After Show, I'm your host George Iceman. What a wonderful show we just had on YouTube. You missed it? You got to go check it out. Kim was my guest, and we got into things. We got into politics, we talked about the war in Iran - or the "theater of war." We talked about currency and we talked about Elon Musk and so much more.
        </strong>
        <br>
        <br>Now we're going to get into some more of the juicy stuff, the supernatural stuff. I call it spiritual warfare. We're going to get into a little bit of that, and believe it or not, Kim just shocked me with some of the knowledge and information she gets in regards to this stuff. Considering she was in the banking system, and dealt with digital currency and all that stuff, she's knowledgeable of certain things - and rituals and magic - and understands how these people work, which is pretty incredible because not everyone is aware of this type of information.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:00:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: When I got into the occult, for 13 years, I started getting into it. And it took me to politics and I'm like, why is this steering me to politics - what's going on here? So I was shocked, because I was not interested in any way, shape, or form in knowing anything about politicians, and doing things, and then I discovered many things: rituals on High Moons and so forth, that politicians do, or pay people to do for them. To pass bills and so forth. It's crazy and a lot of people don't want to believe it, but we live in a wild world. And they say that nothing happens in this realm, unless it's confirmed in the Supernatural Realm - in the plane that we don't see. It's wild, but it's true. Welcome to the show.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:01:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Kim, we were talking and we discussed something - we left people on a little bit of a cliffhanger, where you said they want to control the majority of people in one country. To have the most masses, which in turn to me - not so much the financial situation - but to me, that's Loosh. That's soul energy. Humans are batteries, and they help to manifest certain individuals' desire. And when you have a lot of them, and you're putting them into fear, and they're in tears and they're scared, they help manifest other people's desire. So let's touch on that. I'll give you a moment and talk about it if you don't mind.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:02:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Yeah, and also anger too, George, because that's a really big one. So, getting people to focus in any way on a single human - that's the goal, right? I mean, I assume it's the same for you. If you can get a lot of people to focus on a single human, it gives you more energy, in general, to do the things that you used to do. To say that they do those things themselves - they absolutely do. And in some cases, they pay other people to do it for them. They would have these big meetings and there would be people of the highest caliber in the Dark Arts, waiting outside the door. One such place that this happened is underneath Coutts Bank in the UK. And that would go for all your countries - all the heads of state - leaders would be invited to meetings there. There would be a lot of rituals that would happen.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:03:26</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: On occasion, they do have replicated chairs. So there's the Big Chair, and then there's replicated chairs for each one of the heads of the Families' varying realms. So, as you know, the higher you can get, as far as a realm is concerned, or a Plane of Existence - like you said, things you don't see, right? - the more power you can have, not only against that person, but to also wield your will.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:04:06</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So, if you can get someone, for example, on a soul level, that's like the highest you can go. That's the best energy, the best essence, the best Loosh. So that is why they're so heck-bent, so to speak, on getting to the highest level. It's also the reason why - not to say people's souls are black - but you have to understand there's overlaying realms. So if you're not white or of the Light, or of Golden - which is the Color of Source (or God) - then you have the opposite, right? So, now you need black. You need that blackest black, nothing-looking energy to surround the soul. And that's kind of what their game is. Their game is: the more souls they believe they can take ownership of - by taking ownership over countries - the more they think they can get the soul ownership. Which is absolutely not true, by the way.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:05:19</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: I just wanted to clarify a few things. Because some people watching the show don't know your belief system in regards to Source, or God. I refer to Him as the Lord. You know, God Almighty is usually just archaic, however, you sometimes refer to God as "Source." I think if you could just give it a quick description of why you refer to Him as "Source?" I know through entertainment and sports, they refer to God as "Source." I don't know if it's a military term, but if you could shed some light, so people know that you don't worship Lucifer or Satan.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:05:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: No, no, no, no, no. So, okay. There are many "lords" on this planet that have nothing to do with "the Lord," right? That you're referring to. And when you are saying your prayers, or you are giving gratitude and thanks, it's your intent, George. (George: Yes.) So it's 100% your intent. Me, in my position, and the things that I do, I have to be very careful, because I do not want my energy going in the wrong direction, so I refer to It as the "Source of All Creation." You know, in the long form: I say "Source" because, well, the Source of All Creation is actually the God that you talk about with your intent, you know? And "the Lord" with your intent.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:06:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Now, on the other hand, when the Deep State talks about Source, what they're talking about is the Dark Side. Now, they feel Lucifer is the "source of all creation" - the "light bringer" - which couldn't be further from the truth. But I differentiate that when I say that to you, because I'm speaking about the Source of All Creation - there's only one Creator. I don't care how many ways you overlay it. You might be able to manipulate that Dark energy, or essence, around the soul. You might be able to manipulate Dark energy that people put out, out of anger and fear, you know, in an occult type way - but there's still only one Source of Creation. And because you are a part of that Source of All Creation - it lives within you, right? (George: Yeah.)
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:07:56</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So, the living lifeforce of your existence comes from that Source of All Creation. So, because you are a part of that, you too can also generate the wrong kind of energy, which can only be manipulated and changed. I mean, you might be angry because your car broke down or something, and they can take that energy - anger is anger - they can take that angry energy and they can put it, and manipulate it in such a way that it actually harms people. Or, they gather it all up together when they see you're angry about tariffs, or angry about the war - they gather it all up together and put it in a big pile, and then they shift changes in the world.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:08:45</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: They cannot create. It might feel like creation - but they cannot create - because you are a piece of God, walking this Earth. You can Create with God, and with the energy and the lifeforce that exists within you. So I'm just always very careful and cautious when I say things because it's got nothing to do with... you know, we're all talking to the same folks, let's put it that way - we're all talking to the same Being. I just don't want them to mistake me saying I said "Lord" and then having Lord Rothschild try to do something to me. See, on this level, when you're on a Guardian level, it's a whole other ballgame, compared to humans. Everybody else, it's like your intent means everything.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:09:40</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: And words are powerful - words have consequences. They have power. They have energy. English, the language, spelling, you're doing spells.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:09:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Gematria.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:09:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Gematria. So I understand your perspective and your intent because of the position you're in, so you're a lot more careful. And I'm glad you took a moment to just explain that so anyone who had any doubt whatsoever - they understand what side you're on, which is the Light Side, the Creator of All Things, our Lord and Savior.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:10:08</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: That's the Big Boss, right? (Yes, correct.) Everything we do every day is for God, the Lord, however you want to say it. Source. Whatever it means to you is what it means for you. So for me, I just don't want them to take that and misuse it - from someone in my position.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:10:31</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: And I respect that, and I appreciate that. Thank you for at least shedding some light, for anyone who was watching and not quite sure - because you have a lot of new followers - a lot of new people who are on my channel who are gonna come and see you, come and support you, like what you have to say. And they might ask me or send me a message, "Is Kim on the Light Side? Does she believe in God? Does she believe in... when they refer to God, they, you know, 'Jesus' and so forth." I'm like, yes, she's positive energy, good energy. She's not negative. In fact, most of the messages, if people take an opportunity to listen - you try and put out a positive message of hope, and try to get people's consciousness to think together in a positive way to raise your vibration. And we appreciate that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:11:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Well, and I do believe that there are a lot of people that are not discussed. So when you say the "Son of God," right? I think there are a lot of people, both probably men and women, that have come prior. I mean, we have a long history that nobody actually talks about. (Agreed.) And I think that that was a very prominent figure that we are aware of, that we get to know, simply because everything that was done there - there's a lot of truth to that. You know, there's a lot of truth to: "He died so you didn't have to," you know? There is a giving up, and sealing the fate, unfortunately, for a time. And then there's a releasing of that soul, but that soul is a very important soul to Source. And therefore, it would be one... you know, I'm sure when you were doing your occult days, George, there would be particular souls, or people, that you would focus on, simply because they were more Light - gave more energy, you know? Had a deeper connection with God - and you would try to break that connection or at least use what they were giving out.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:12:47</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Correct.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:12:48</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Yeah.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:12:49</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Yeah. It's a lot that goes on on that other Realm people are not aware of. I don't usually get into the specifics because you know, you don't want people to get too curious, Kim. And then they're like, I'll try it, I'll try it. It's just not good. So I try to give just enough, if that makes sense, of the information that they need to know, so they're aware. They're mostly warning shots: stay away from this stuff. I want to rally back to a particular thing, I know you touched on it briefly, but - the Throne.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:13:17</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: There is a folklore, if you don't mind me saying, a folklore in the occult of - and there's different, let me get this, the wording is very important to me - it may not necessarily sometimes be just a chair, like an actual throne. It sometimes could be a talisman, it could be a crown, it could be a certain thing. But these items have power associated to them. They have a connection. There's something about them. They're almost related to us as relics, in some way, shape, or form.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:14:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: And there's rumors of certain elitists that will go to these certain artifacts... hence, the Throne. Sit on this throne, and see if something happens. If a spirit possesses their body, inherits their body, and now takes over their body, their temple, and controls them, and something is reincarnated. The Elite believe in this, the Occult believe in this. Mediums do this in front of everybody. People don't understand that. A medium for a time being allows a spiritual being to enter their body and they communicate in the voice and send out a message. But this is more than just a medium, isn't it, Kim?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:14:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: It is.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:14:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: The question is: does this Throne still exist today?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:14:48</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Sure it does. It's in Mar-a-Lago. (Wow.) It was actually here down the street - not in my house obviously - but it was down the street for a while. I knew it was there. A lot of Generals came and tried to activate said Throne. And I joked about it because I get to see - with the Key Intelligence and Military System and stuff that I created - I get to see a lot of things, you know? And I'm watching, you know, I don't really eat popcorn, but I'm sitting there snacking away, you know - I don't drink soda, so I was drinking some water - and I'm watching this. And I'm watching all these people line up and I'm like, they're sitting there with the, who has the Golden Booty, I called it, you know? So, this is, and I don't know about in the occult, but I'm assuming they teach you the hierarchical structure of the Dark ones. And I assume they teach you, when you're in the occult, which Generals, so to speak, can take you to which Realm?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:16:10</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Okay, yeah.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:16:12</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So, the highest Realm would be like Lucifer, right? That would be the highest Realm or the Dark One as they call it. So the reason for that is because that takes you to the lowest of the low pit of let's call it Hell, so to speak - the Lower Astral - the thing where no life actually exists. And that is where Lucifer resided.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:16:46</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: And so, the chair actually represents "black" - it represents the Dark, the darkest of the Dark. Now, if you think about how light kind of works, so the absence of all light is black. And Lucifer's job, in part, was... because he still was a being of Source at one point in time, therefore you need that lifeforce to exist. So they use people in the occult to collect that lifeforce for them down there so that they can continue to exist. Isn't that interesting? (Yes.) So same thing goes for Baal, Belial, Beelzebub, and Baphomet. (Those are bad.) They like the B words, man, they really do.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:17:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So each one of those Generals, though, will only take you so far. So they would be in charge of like the Eighth Realm or the Seventh Realm or the Sixth Realm. And so, by utilizing those... see, now each one also had another type of Realm. So, for example, Baal. Baal was not only in charge of, say, in part - not all, because there's three thrones - so, in part, he was in charge of the Eighth Realm. So, one of three that would be in charge of the actual Realm.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:18:19</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So that being said, he shared control of that Realm with others - but his job in all Realms was frequencies. Sending negative frequencies, Dark frequencies, he would manipulate humans on Earth and beings elsewhere, with those Dark frequencies. And then in turn, projects like, for example, he would create special stuff, George, like you said. So he had this device that looked kind of like an organ and it would have all these colored crystals on it, and he would send out frequencies that would cause illness or dark thoughts or anger or fear, and it would amplify that. And then it would all go, of course, to the king, which was Lucifer, king of the Realms. Lucifer was the king of almost all Realms down below.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:19:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So each one would serve a certain purpose. So they would try... now, other programs here on Earth - those that are part of that bloodline, the bloodline of Lucifer - allegedly, also create programs like the CIA has, like PSI ops. So they then create secondary programs to help the process along with these special items that you're referring to, George. There's other ones like the soul catchers, and there's lots of different types of stuff. The chair being one. So the chair, the most honored chair, is the darkest one that allows you to be inhabited by Lucifer itself. It allows - you're basically giving him access to Earth. And that's the darkest chair. But then you've got like a gray chair, you know, and you've got a blue chair, and a purple chair, and a red chair.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:20:25</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: And that would be based on the quadrants, quadrant areas and who would be in charge over them, which would be one of the Generals.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:20:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Yeah, exactly. See, now you're getting into the different bloodlines - the true bloodlines - and so whoever sits in that chair might only get, Astaroth or something.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:20:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Correct. And they have, you know, it's funny - and they have territories, they're very territorial. Humans are very territorial, and they have land in many parts. Like, New Orleans is Leviathan - very powerful and dirty and very scary, that place. But they have territory; they're very territorial. Do you remember a rapper, it's very interesting: Nas. Do you remember Nas the rapper? (Kim: "Mm-mm.")
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:21:18</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Well, there's a big thing that came out a couple years ago, I found it to be very interesting, which has to do with what I'm talking about. So, he had a new running shoe. And he went from "good guy country" to a dark hip hop, in a video where he would... he simulated sex with Satan. On a throne. Carefully, on a throne. Interesting. Then, he decides to put out a collector's edition running shoe, where it had blood in the shoe. And it had all these sayings and so forth. So people now would - of their own free will - purchase these shoes. Of their own free will; put them on. Accepting whatever association to whatever entity is with them - to enter them, or take over them, or be attached to them - you would have an attachment.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:22:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: And they would walk around, of their own free will, not knowing that they are walking around taking control of territory - land assignments for this particular being and entity. It's perplexing. They only made 666 pairs of these shoes. With blood. Whose blood was it? What ritual was this for? I mean, if that doesn't tell you anything, I don't know what will. But this really happens; it's in real life. But just going back to follow up on territories and these emphases on how they take authority.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:22:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: But governments work the same way, George. So he does this ceremony on this Throne - we don't know which one it was - we can make an assumption that he was doing it for some demon somewhere. (Okay.) So, he puts... you can take someone's blood in the occult, I assume, and you can weave magic on that person. But also, there is some power when you take the blood of many. (Yes.) So, if you're taking the blood of many, and you're "giving it," so-called, to some demon somewhere, then you personally gain favor with that demon. (Correct.)
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:23:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So, it's like you said, George. So there's blood in there - whose blood? It doesn't really matter. Because that person was already, or many persons were already sacrificed to make those shoes. And the fact that he got many people to wear those shoes, now, not only gives them territory over that person - it also gives them territory over where they are. (There you go.) So that demon gains great power. (Correct.) And see, this is what the Trump organization is trying to do. (Wow.) So they're not doing it with blood - they're a little bit more subtle - but they are in some ways, when you think about what they're doing. They're spilling the blood, right? And then they come in and they take over the country - and the blood is on everyone's hands, right? Allegedly, because as a citizen, in their mind (because this is not the case, really), you are subject to the Guardian of that land.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:24:30</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So this is why it's so important that they put their politicians in those places, because they are "the Guardian" over the citizens of the land, and by giving them - replacing that Guardian with one of their Guardians - now they think they can control the soul of the land, and give them to whatever demon - Lucifer or otherwise, right?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:25:12</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: In a said deal that was already made.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:25:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: In a said deal that was already made. That's correct. But that's not how it really works anymore. No.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:25:19</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: No. There you go, folks. You wanted some deep stuff. I mean, I don't know, Kim, it doesn't get any deeper than that. That's some pretty in-your-face information.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:25:28</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: We appreciate you guys being here. I wanna give everyone an opportunity, there's about 4 or 5 questions to ask Kim. Please be polite and professional and considerate, and I thank you for your time. We'll begin with Carmen. Carmen hi, welcome to the show tonight and what is your question for Kim?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:25:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Carmen: Hi, hi Kim. First of all I want to thank you for coming today. I had the opportunity to listen to about one third of your report you posted today, and I know that the past weekend was hard for you and us, so thank you for making time to be with us. So my question is about disclosure, the full disclosure. There are so many people and organizations and conferences and they say disclosure now, disclosure and I... and George had a guest one time, Natalia, which he also said that kind of the alien is the new form of the demons. So I would be very curious to see your take on this, on the disclosure and who is coming, what they are saying, what they want.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:27:01</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Thank you, Carmen.
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Well, much like people do - Others, you know, have chosen - we know of the story about the Fallen.
        <br>
        <br>[Below, Kim is referring to the 2006 ABC Family miniseries "Fallen", based on "The Fallen" novel series.]
        <br>
        <br>There's actually a movie, George, have you ever seen it? Called "The Fallen?" (Yes.) Yeah. It's actually a crazy movie, but there's a lot of truth in those things.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:27:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Most of them have, Kim - they're telling you what they're doing - most of them do have so much truth to it, it's insane. But I digress, sorry.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:27:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Yeah, and how they fight constantly. (Yeah.) And I say this for a reason because, you're talking about Realm people. You know, there are some that fell, and fell all the way down and chose the Dark. And then there are some that maybe fell out of favor, that are still choosing the Light. And then, there are Others that choose no side. And so, allegedly, this movie is about one who chose no side, is what it is.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:28:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Now, as far as alien, "alien" basically means anything that is foreign. Foreign to this planet. Maybe not born of this planet, you could even say everything that is not of Source is an alien. Now, I don't know if you've ever met anyone - and George, you're kind of the exception to this rule - and I don't know if it has to do with being the medium thing?
        <br>
        <br>Kim: But I had a friend who, back when I was young and dinosaurs roamed the earth, there was a really big deal about Ouija boards at that time. And all the kids were, you know, this is in the 80s, and there was a movie that came out about Ouija boards, and a lot of kids at sleepover parties and stuff were fascinated with these things, and I'm pretty sure it was designed to sell them for that reason. But I had a friend and her sister that had one, and they tried to get me to do it; I said "No, I'm not interested in any of that." Then, they started doing weird things, like candles and just things that, as a young kid, I didn't really understand - but it gave me a really bad, bad feeling. And I'm like, nah, I don't want to do that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:29:22</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: And then I eventually stopped being friends with her. And I had changed schools for other reasons and that kind of thing, so it really wasn't because of that. It was just because my mom moved and that kind of stuff. So, I ran into her at a mall where she was working, and this was probably, maybe about four years later. And she was one of - when she was, you know, before all this happened, she was one of the prettiest girls in school. You know, she was the blonde hair, blue eyes, just everything at that time in the early 80s, tan, you know - everything that all girls wanted to be. And when I saw her, wow, I could see the evil in her face.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:30:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So, beings oftentimes that choose the Dark - and we all have the ability to do that, right? We have the ability to choose either side - as humans, we do. And I'm not saying that that's something all of you would want to do, but there are people who do choose the Dark, and it changes them; it changes their physical appearance.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:30:37</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So when you say, "aliens are demons," I'm going to say that some of them are foreign, probably not human - and the darker you go, the worse you look. (Jeez.) So, I can say, the less lifeforce you have, the worse you look. Because you're giving all your lifeforce away. There are people that say you die a thousand deaths or whatever if you go to Hell, and it's like in some cases that's kind of true because it takes all the lifeforce out of your soul every day, and it feeds them - because they cannot get any - they're not connected to Source. Your soul always remains with Source - it doesn't matter where they try to stick it. It doesn't matter if you go to the Darkest place because your choices are made.
        <br>
        <br>[Short interruption.]
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:31:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: But what I'm saying is when you make those choices and those decisions, Source is still with you. God is still with you. He doesn't go away. So even if you go down there, He's still there. And you can be saved even at that point in time. All you have to do is choose it. But that makes you a commodity in that world. So I hope that answers your questions about aliens versus demons. And I would say that there are plenty of beings out there that are not human that are just as Light as you are. And they want to choose the Light and they want to choose good things, and have. And there are plenty... we just have had a lot of interaction with the Other, you know, due to a lot of black magic and things like that that happened here. All kinds of messing about, so to speak.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:32:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Thank you, Kim. Carmen, does that help you?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:32:38</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Carmen: Thank you. Yeah, thank you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:32:39</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Thank you so much. Have a wonderful evening.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:32:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Thanks, Carmen.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:32:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: All right, next is Raffaella. Raffaella, thank you so much for being patient and waiting. How are you? And what's your question for Kim this evening?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:32:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Raffaella: First of all, thank you, George. And thank you, Kim. Wonderful Kim. The last week, everybody was praying for you because it was awful.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:33:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: It was terrible.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:33:06</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Raffaella: I knew God is going to protect you, but it was pretty harsh. The whole crowd that loves you over here was smashed[??] with you. So I thought, thank you God that we have the honor to be embodied to carry this mission out. (Kim: Yeah.) How are you doing?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:33:29</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: I'm good, I'm okay. I've been up since about 02:00 this morning, so I'm a little tired at this point, but I'm okay. I mean, you know, it's that thing where you've got to recharge. You've got to recharge. You go to Source, you recharge. You go to God, however you say it, you recharge. No matter what life throws at you, there's always a refuge. And sometimes you have to go within because it's so hard and muddy out there to go without. So, no. There's always a place to recharge. And you know, I don't take this stuff personally. You know, I really, I try not to. But it's like, are you kidding me right now? You know, and I say my fair share of bad words and just keep going, you know?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:34:19</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Raffaella: You have all the right to say bad words, because they just like a poo. And I love to do this - I'm a happy Italian - I can say about ??? ????, and it helps. Thing is, Kim, we talk all about all these demons. And I swear to God, I was alive and awakened in the night I was born, through a big trauma. And I made my choice when I was very little, like you, and I always knew that I came for this time. I'm so grateful to know you and all the soul family members that are united with you.
        <br>
        <br>Raffaella: I tell you, I call Him like this: God Almighty, Loving Light, Divine Source, Creator, present in all. Present in all.
        <br>
        <br>Raffaella: If the worst demon has this little sparkle of Light that is completely enlightened, they just misuse it. And I wanted to ask you, Kim: do you realize that... I mean, how can I explain to you, because I don't want to say something over your head. But when I made this choice, I knew this Golden Age - now I know how to call it - would come. And I was searching and searching. And I was kind of just, like you, and all of us, like George. George went a little darker path just to know better and to inform better. He was always Light, I know that.
        <br>
        <br>Raffaella: We all talk about the Lucifer - as there is the Almighty God, there is the anti-God. And nobody says this, right? And I believe strongly... what do you think about it? That God gave us the sovereignty to be free-will, loving-life Source creators, that experience different Ages through a collective of the planet - let's say 10% - that makes the Shift. And I remember clearly this moment when the... if you want to say... I believe myself, what do you think about it? That the original sin - if there was an original sin (because our wonderful Almighty God sees everything in equanimity; there is no bad or evil - He understands experience, right?) - and when Yeshua from Nazareth said, "I am the truth, the path, and the Light," what did He do on that cross? He gave a universal forgiveness.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:37:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Yeah. But you have to want it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:37:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Raffaella: Yeah. You want to care.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:37:13</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: You have to want it - you have to actually ask. It's kind of like when your kids do something, or your family members do, someone you love does something to you that's hurtful, or you felt was not right in any way. If they don't talk to you, if they don't ask you for your forgiveness... if they don't, you've got to...
        <br>
        <br>Kim: And when you go to God Almighty, as you say - the AMG, right? If you go to the AMG and you say, "Hey, I'm so sorry I made this choice and this decision." And it's like the all-loving, perfect parent, if we could ever have one. And of course He loves you - doesn't ever stop loving you no matter what you do. Might not like what you do, but that's different than being, you know, standing there in the Face of Source and basically saying, "I can do this better than You."
        <br>
        <br>Kim: What happens to people when we say, "Hey, God, no - I can do this better. I've got another way." Or, you know... "Okay, run along then, go, go!" You know? Same thing with your kids: "Okay, you go try that." And that's what happened. There was sovereign will, and that's what happened. So, turning away from the Face of God, and misusing a Creation, is what caused what you call the "original sin."
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:38:56</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Raffaella: Right. And you know what, Kim? I believe firmly - I wanted to tell it to you and to everybody - with all these demons still running around. First of all, I believe that we live a consequence of a collective free will, unconscious choice. And second of all, I believe that the messenger is somebody who calls out, and reaches the Golden Age and says, "You have to be... you're the ones you have been waiting for." You have to accept in a certain percentage, in a certain room, because otherwise it's going to be harder. And all...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:39:39</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Oh, sure. I mean, God, for some people, God could come down from a big cloud and say, look, everyone, I heard all your prayers, and this is where you come from, and tell everybody all the things that only God would know, right? And there'd still be people on this planet that would go, "No, it's okay, I'm good."
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:40:01</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Raffaella: But you know, Kim, don't you believe that as the demon...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:40:06</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Sorry, Raffaella - I just have other people; I got to get them in. I've given you eight minutes. I apologize. I don't want to cut it short, but I got to give everyone a chance. I want to thank you for being on the show. Have a great night, and we'll see you again soon. All right. Thank you so much.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:40:20</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Raffaella: Yes, I will write it to Kim. Thank you, Kim. Thank you for all you do. We love you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:40:26</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Thank you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:40:26</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Thank you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:40:28</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: All right. Next is I'm going to bring out... uhh, uh, Firaj? I think it's called Firaj - is that correct? Am I saying your name right?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:40:35</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Firouzeh: Thank you, George: Firouzeh.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:40:38</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Firouzeh. Oh, I would never get that. If you didn't correct me - I would not correct that. But not to be offensive, I'm going to refer to you as "Miss F." So Kim, Miss F. Miss F, how are you? What's your question for Kim this evening?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:40:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Firouzeh: Thank you so much. Well, Kim, thank you so much for all you do. And thank you, George, for inviting Kim to come. (Always.) So Kim, I have a couple of political questions. So, I'm partially Iranian and half French, but regardless, with what's going on with Iran - there were many people who live there who were saying, "Oh my God, thank you. We are now free. This republic will leave now." And right now they're killing, I don't know - 20, 30 people a day. Basically, they round up a thousand people, you probably know. They're killing so many people just trying to show them, you know, hey, you disrespected us. So where do you think that's going to go? I mean, we're not just talking about Iran - the whole Middle Eastern region - because that's a special area.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:41:59</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: It is a special area. For a lot of reasons. You know, there were some gates that existed in Iran. There is a positive one, and then there were ones that kind of overlaid the positive one and created many negative ones. So the facilities that the Americans hit - they knew what those facilities were. They knew what they were expecting, and like George said, things are a ritual. You spill the blood in the land. You do all the things, and then part of it in this case was - George, correct me if I'm wrong - you can open a gate. (Correct. Yeah.) Yeah. Kim: So they were hoping to open that Darker gate over there. It was one of the Darkest ones on the planet, believe it or not. There was another gate...
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Because in magic, my understanding is (and I've seen some stuff), there is often two keys - one is Black and one is White. So there's like a balance you're supposed to do or something? Is that true? Or do they have white-magic workers and black-magic workers? Or... that's a question for you, George.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:43:39</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Ask me that one more time, sorry.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:43:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Okay, so kind of one of the things I saw was a lot of this like Gematria. (Yeah.) You know, they've got all those old drawings that tell you the keys on how to do things. And one of them that I saw, the key - one Key was Black and one Key was White. And they say in order to get more power on the Dark Side, you also must keep a balance, even if it's false intentions.
        <br>
        <br>Like, you know, the World Bank has humanitarian programs, as an example. Do they save people with those programs? Well, maybe they feed a few people, but they kill 10 times as many. Like I don't know, there's something to do with money magic actually in this particular case.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:44:27</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: It's going to be money magic. It's going to be a manifestation - and not so much on death for money magic. They won't go that route usually for that; that's something else. I wanna give the right information here. Umm.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:44:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Opening gates. How about opening gates?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:44:56</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: To open the gate, blood will be shed because there's a sacrifice required. It has to be at a certain time on a certain day; you have to have the right people to open up the right gates. It will be over ley lines on the earth. All ley lines will usually have water, hence we get into a little bit of the - what's the word I'm looking for - when you try to make gold out of other metals? (Kim: Alchemy.) Thank you. It has to do a lot with alchemy. So they'll go about it, in those certain areas, to open up doorways.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:45:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: If... and I'm gonna say this: no matter how perfect the spell is, no matter who they bring from whatever tribe - because they'll bring different people from different parts of the world that they feel are the strongest shaman, the strongest master magicians... People might not know this, but in the core group, there's two, sometimes three, two high priests that conduct magic rituals. Two at one time. One is the backup, the other one usually does everything. He never makes a lot of money. He's the one that they send out to do rituals at certain locations.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:46:15</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: For instance, if a politician is going to do a ceremony for a bill to be passed, he would hire the group. The group would get the witch (the master witch); he'd go out and do the ritual - possibly a sacrifice on a child (which has already come out publicly on many forums, of that way, to get it to happen) - and that'll happen. The bill will be passed; it'll go through. That they've done.
        <br>
        <br>When you're talking about a portal or doorway for a massive entity to enter through... at the end - and that's not a cop-out, I'll tell you the truth - at the end God has to approve it. Source has to say, yes, I allow it. Because if He's like, not today, it don't matter how many magicians you have, how much blood you shed, how much perfection you follow the book, you're just not gonna open it up.
        <br>
        <br>Not that I'm aware of; not that I'm aware of. Maybe you know of this somewhere else in the land, but if God says no, then the answer is no, and no door is opened.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:47:29</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So, one of the things that I'm aware of - and I don't know if you've ever seen this - has anybody ever talked to you in those days about something they call red mercury?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:47:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Not red mercury, no. Never dealt with red mercury.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:47:46</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Okay. A red dust of any sort?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:47:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Black, black - usually black only, never red. The only thing in red, the only thing in red that would come, would be dragon's blood, used to write on a particular type of paper, on which you would make a pact. But it's called dragon's blood, it could be red, and that's used in a pact ceremony on a particular paper with whomever.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:48:18</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Right. (That's all I know about this.) Yeah, well, there's many different kinds of this dust. (Okay.) You know, there's positive dust and negative dust. (Okay.) But you're right in the fact that in order to open the gate, and ultimately let the being enter the realm, so to speak - in this case we're talking about Earth, you know - Source never left, and you need 100% agreement. Even in the Darkest of days, in the Darkest of Ages, in the Darkest of Times, Source still had at least 21% say of what happens; what comes into the realm. So you're right - even though it was a minor share, you guys can dance all you want to dance and do whatever you want to do and it doesn't matter - if you don't have that 21% vote. (Gotcha.) Yeah.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:49:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Yeah, again, you're in a different level of the information that you're aware of - from politicians and military and other elitists. I'm just saying from our level, or my level, that I experienced or studied - anything I was a part of - if He says no, then it's no. And I could be perfect, Kim. I mean...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:49:34</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Now, here's the other thing. You mentioned this earlier when we were on the YouTube, but there is definitely something to what we call sex magic. (Yes.) And yes, there's an exchange of energy and that kind of thing that happens. But, in - and I hate to say this - when it's done for power, power over the person, male or female, that's being raped, that kind of thing... energy, of course, is released - adrenochrome, all the crap, you know. But there's also something else to it, where, in the moment - and I know this sounds crazy - but in the moment, when there's a pheromone that is released, if when the men and women are together and there's a, you know, the "substances" that are together there - where there's a moment, believe it or not, of love.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:50:46</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Even though it can be the worst scenario you can possibly imagine, and you could say I do not - but when there is a physical response, you know, to this activity - there is a, even if it's for just a brief zeptosecond, you can't stop it; you can't prevent it. It is built into your body where there's a moment of love that happens. So the reason why they do this is to try to bypass Source's agreement. So God doesn't consent, well, we'll get the little consent here. Maybe we'll get many consents, just briefly, for just that one second of consent. And that is, to them, worth gold. (Gotcha.) That's why it's done. And the purer the soul - the younger the children - that's why they do that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:51:39</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Yeah. Another thing I'll just add - you're going on a whole other level because you went really high up on that. On the sex side of the magic, a lot of the time it's also in association with sigil powering, when they're powering up sigils. So they'll maybe want to manifest a desire, or something, and they'll have to take - I'm not gonna give it away on how it works, guys - but there's certain letters that are put together in your speech, your manifestation, what you want. It turns into a logo - like McDonald's, like Burger King. That's a created sigil; it's a logo.
        <br>
        <br>George: When you're looking at demons, you'll almost never see - no one will write down the demon's name - it'll be a logo. It's a representation of the name; it's a sigil. You'll see it in tattoos. For instance, some people that do tattoos will do sigil tattoos, not knowing your sigils belonging to a demon - and they'll think it's cool. Goes back to what we said, Kim, where now, of your own free will, you put on the crest of another being, which, guess who has authority over your life now?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:52:56</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Now, you want to know something interesting about how and why these things are formed? (Yeah.) So, the Light Language that is spoken between angels and demons, for lack of a better term, and also between... with Source and of Creation - is all a bunch of symbols.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:53:17</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: It's all symbolism.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:53:18</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: It's all symbolism. Well, both sides use the same language, just one is usually done in black and the other one is in gold. (Ahh.) So they look very different. But the reason why you have a lot of symbols with a lot of weird little thingies in them that represent these beings is because it's the language of creation.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:53:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: There you go.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:53:45</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So, you're creating for that particular being, and that's their... what it is they need or want.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:53:52</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: That's their need - that is that's actually what you're saying - (Kim: Yeah.) that logo is their needs and their wants. (Kim: Yeah.) And it creates manifestation when it's presented. Sex magic has a lot to do with that because, you know, sex magic is a form of creation. You're creating another human being, another being.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:54:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: And there's just that moment of love. (Wow.) I'm telling you, it's brief. It's a physical response that kind of initiates it, let's just say, on both sides, and that moment there - that's just that brief second, even if it's an awful situation. So please, anybody listening to this, if you've had this happen to you, don't in any way think, "Oh my God, I gave them love - I didn't love those people - I hated those people." Don't take it that way. It's a physical response that initiates that one second. I mean, it doesn't have to be... less than a second, even. And that can be used in the creation process to get what the other party wants.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:54:57</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Yeah. Miss F, that's a lot of information to digest, I hope that helps you. (Kim: I know.) Thank you so much.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:55:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Firouzeh: Thank you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:55:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Yeah, just touching on that. It's interesting what you say, I mean, me and you could go back and forth for two hours on manifestation when it comes to sex magic: how many forms, why do they do it, how many different ceremonies, bla bla bla, it goes on and on. But funny though, I've never come across it... money - it's also used in money - to manifest money with the sex, but usually not ritual. Ritual is more for power. Or a dealing - again, it's different levels. It'd be just on my... like, if you're, if a governor or someone goes to war, and sends soldiers to battle, X amount of souls would be sacrificed. Make no mistake that those souls are powered energy, that are sacrificed to power an entity, a being who will take over that land, that territory - there is a deal in place.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:56:12</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: And do you want to know something else very interesting? (Please, yeah.) Okay, so when a soul dies of unfortunate natural causes... let's just say you have a disease, and they can't cure it or something, and then eventually what happens is life becomes so painful you agree to leave. There is an agreement. I'm gonna say it, but there is. Under those circumstances, you have... it's basically the ultimate sin, you know - not the first sin, but the ultimate sin - because you're agreeing to leave. But honestly, there's nothing you can do about it. It's just a program.
        <br>
        <br>Kim: But then, 72 hours later, is when your soul actually leaves. But you actually kind of agreed to it, therefore they now have the right. Because at that time - not anymore - but at that time, they now had the right to use that soul into infamy.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:57:15</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Wow. So don't agree.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:57:17</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Yeah. Lucifer likes suicide.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:57:19</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Yeah. Don't do it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:57:21</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Well, and you ever see those people that are diagnosed with something? They say, you got two weeks to live, and it's 15 years later, they're still around? Because...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:57:28</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: They wanted them - I know what you're about to say. (Kim: Yeah.) They wanted them to agree: "Okay, 15 days, let's go." And that parts with the soul and the body, and they take possession.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:57:40</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: And you come to terms with it for yourself. (Yeah.) There are people out there that don't come to terms with it. They're like, "That's not true. I'm going to drink this juice and I'm going to eat this and I'm going to change my life and I'm going to stop doing whatever it is I'm doing that's causing this problem," and boom, you know, 15, 20 years later they're still around.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:57:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: God bless them.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:57:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So, yeah. But on the flip side, when a soul dies, or a human dies - not of consent - they actually use them to power portals. Something we call the Dark Tower. Have you ever heard of anybody mention the Dark Tower?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:58:18</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: I've heard of the Dark Tower, but I don't know the power behind it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:58:21</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Yeah, it's souls. And so they go round and round and round and round. But remember, different types of bindings have expiration dates. And I don't know... You probably know more about this than I do. So a soul binding of the highest level can only last so long. Especially in a non-consensual being.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:58:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Is it seven years? Is it 99 years? Do you know the length on that one?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:58:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Well, where they are is a time of no time, so it's kind of hard to say. But I would say... it seems to me it's about a century-ish.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:59:01</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Century-ish. Okay.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:59:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Yeah. (All right.) And then eventually they would be allowed to go to the next place. But, yeah. So it's a traumatic soul - because you didn't consent to leave the vessel, you know. There's also a different process; it looks different, if you've ever been around anybody who's died.
        <br>
        <br>Kim: If there is a consensual - like, you've said basically, "Look, I've said my piece. I'm dying of X disease, whatever it is. It just is what it is. It's old age, whatever the problem is over here." On the other hand, when something traumatic has happened, and the person dies, there's a lot of wriggling. It's not like in the movies where they just fall over, they get shot and they all fall over with their eyes open. No, not in any way, shape, or form.
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So two different types of things: one's consensual, one's not consensual. It becomes too painful to be here. And I totally get that, but it's all a trick, it's a scheme.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:00:04</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: I agree.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:00:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: And then, on the other hand, the other one is used to power - to keep a door open, a gate open. Allow that, like an elevator, you know, "Demons R Us," where they can all come and go whenever they want. Because even if you are sitting in a special chair, you agree to have the demon come, the demon can only stay here for so much time (Correct.) before it has to go. So, whether that's only at the nighttime - I know of a lawyer that said, "Oh, I can only come in at night." You know?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:00:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Yeah, it's an expiry on that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:00:38</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: There's an expiry on that. Exactly. So, that being said, you still got to keep the door open - they got to do something to keep the gate open. So that's part of what it is.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:00:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Ahh. Interesting. Interesting. I mean, it's good, I mean, you could go back and forth and try to piece some of the things together. (Kim: Yeah.) You have and I got. OK. Yeah, that's where that goes, because, though they show you only so much, Kim. You only learn so much on a level. And then another level will show you the opposite, so you don't know that. So I don't think there's a particular occultist or master witch or warlock that knows everything - because they don't give you everything. You just can't... because that's too much power for any human. That's way too much power. You know just enough; somebody else knows enough, because there's got to be someone above, that controls everyone. And I believe that's how that system works.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:01:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: That's exactly right. And I'm only trying to piece together pieces as well, based on quantum physics - how that would relate to what it is you used to do - and then I'm like, okay, that makes sense: all that essence going in one concentrated location. You know, all that Source, raw Source, power. You know?
        <br>
        <br>George: War is one particular way that I was taught how they go into the territory and take over that land. Demons love territory. They love land; there's deals usually made. I don't want to go into different scenarios, but there's...
        <br>
        <br>Kim: We could probably have a whole show and just talk about this instead of politics.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:02:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: We can, and I could show proof of people that'll wear a certain color, you know, and understand that color is, there's a sacrifice coming. And X amount of people will be - and then exactly what I said - a few days later, my friends are like, "Oh my God, this person just showed up on TV. And it's exactly what you said - there was a fire next and a lot of people died!" And I'm like, I just don't want to know; I really just don't want to know...
        <br>
        <br>George: But anyways. We have two more people left, Kim. We're gonna give them a chance to ask their questions before we say good night. I thank you for your time. John, welcome to the show. Thanks for being patient. What is your question, my friend?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:02:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>John: Hey man. Yeah George, I just want to thank Raffaella for what she said before. I really felt her essence. And I want to thank you for your listening. I can see that you've put a lot of energy into the world and I can see that the time now is for us men to listen to the women. (Yes.) I'm finding the women in my life are just beautiful and they're standing up. And it was interesting watching you. I can see that you're struggling a bit, I'm struggling a bit, and the women in our life are standing up, which is a great thing. And thank you, Kim. And I feel very privileged to be able to ask a few questions and I won't muck around. So many good things in this show.
        <br>
        <br>One thing. I'm from Australia and I have some friends and we talk a lot about stuff. We have, in Melbourne, Victoria, we have a war memorial called the Shrine. And as time goes on - this was built after the First World War - and they voted in the Parliament in Victoria, or the Federal Parliament, I'm not sure, but it was voted down 18 to 1 to build it. So nobody wanted to build it, but they still used the soldiers from World War... the returned soldiers to build this Shrine.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:04:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>John: Now it's turning out that - and you may think I'm drawing a long bow - but there is a lot of... what do I say, in Australia there's some very Dark things happening in relation to... how am I going to put this? Energy, and our governments basically inverting everything. And it's happening all around the world obviously. And it appears to us that the power structure from the Northern Hemisphere seems to be moving. Like they've gutted Australia. Australia is a mineral-rich country; they've gutted this country.
        <br>
        <br>And it appears to be set up through weather manipulation, whatever, mass migration, and the "Tiny Hat" people are utilising this Shrine as a symbol of... it has a lot of Jewish-Hellenic symbolism around it. Yeah, I'd just love you to talk a little bit about that if you understand anything of the Shrine in Melbourne.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:05:30</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: I have not seen that particular one. Which means it's not a place I've had to go clean something. That doesn't mean that I haven't been to hundreds of massacres and war shrines around the world, so it doesn't surprise me - it's definitely something I will take a look at.
        <br>
        <br>I know that most of the time when I am there, there's a particular area, Uluru, obviously - that's an obvious one. And I've been to a couple of the old forts from the times of war; there's often things that happen there. Some of the islands that are closer to Australia, not like, you know, Fiji and that kind of thing. I've been to Tasmania, obviously - that's a given.
        <br>
        <br>I have... there's an area of the four - you don't call it the four corners - you call it the place where there's four time zones all at once. That's a really bad area right there. Pine Gap, I mean, you know, I've been there. Then there's this area where it's some kind of very special brown dirt. It's not necessarily even dirt, it's something else, and it's a mining area. I know that for sure. But there's something else that exists there. I've been there a couple of times, cleaned out some stuff, but I think it's one of your portal places.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:07:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: So oftentimes, when I see war memorials like this in other places, oftentimes they... sometimes they're active and sometimes they're not, but it's like George said - it opens up a portal or a gateway, for a time, if enough blood is spilled. And they usually put up a shrine to represent that spilled blood - and then the power doesn't last forever though - it lasts for a time.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:07:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>John: Kim, what I was going to say, I forgot to mention that in Victoria, Australia, I'll put it this way, over the whole country, a few months ago we had a vote for a referendum to grant the government power to send a voice out to our Indigenous tribes in Australia, of which there's about 360, I think, or a bit more. It was a Trojan Horse, and fortunately it got voted down.
        <br>
        <br>But what's now happened in Victoria - one of the states of Australia - is that the Australian government's decided we're going to introduce our own voice and it's gonna be taxpayer funded. So what they're doing is they're sending representatives of the voice committee from the government out to the tribe, but they're not calling them tribes, they're calling them tribal entities. So what it means...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:08:39</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Now, one thing I have experienced - and I've experienced this in a lot of areas where the tribes still have a lot of influence - is you have, for example, Maori, and they're New Zealand predominantly, and then you have Rothschild-born Maori. Hawaii, they did the same thing. You have the original tribes in Hawaii, and then you have the Rothschild version, as an example. I mean, you're blue, you know, Australia is blue. So you belong to the Blue Dragon section. So that's why I use Rothschild. But it's definitely... they could only use the fake-tribe people for so long. Now, they're desperately trying to get the tribes' consent to give up the land, without them understanding their connection to it. You know, it's not like you can... when you have the real Aboriginals there, they're way too smart for that. Sorry to say - way too spiritual; way too understanding. But they're going to give it a go anyway, because they were told to.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:09:57</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Kim, just to add to that, is it possible they have soul rights over that land? These tribes? And the government - or those above the government - are using the government to get their authorization and permission, not just in the physical sense, but in the spiritual as well? That has soul ties.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:10:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Well, and they've tried to do this many times, too. So as covenants and agreements and whatnot expire... Now see, the Maori were one of the original folk that agreed to have a portal open, and out comes Marduk, right? So, one of the original commitments about 16,000 years ago was actually one that the Maori - and as you know, well, you may not know - but there is a definitive reason why actual agreements that the Aboriginals in that region agree to are always signed in song. I say "song and dance," but song. Now, it's because it's a frequency - it emits a certain frequency. It actually comes from their soul. So, making a commitment like that - they're not the only ones that participated, but we were in really bad shape at that time. So, I mean, it is what it is. But anyway, making that commitment, bound by the soul, has an expiry date. Typically that time is, in my experience, somewhere up to 500 years, depending on the agreement. Now, it would have had to have been renewed - that means every 500 years, continuously. That's why they put the fake Maori in place. But see, there still comes a time where they're not... it doesn't happen anymore. And now they need the real Aboriginals because it didn't work with the fake ones.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:12:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: They don't understand why these things and these rituals are not working anymore. So they think if they get the Aboriginals, or maybe the American Indians in America, or one of these other tribes - the original tribes of Europe, known as the Germanic tribes - if they get some of those people involved, then they feel that they can do what you said: a land grab.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:12:31</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Thank you, John. I hope she helped with that question.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:12:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>John: George, can I just say one thing? (Sure.) We have a song that we're singing in Australia and it's called Time to Rise. It was written by a gentleman in the UK, Ben Hawkes, and it reads: Lay love down where they cross in the morning. It is time to rise. When we're done, they are done. So that's it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:12:52</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Yeah. True.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:12:54</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Thank you, John. I appreciate that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:12:57</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>John: Thank you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:12:56</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Thank you, John.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:12:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: All right. Last but not least, last question. Let's make it quick. Homef, how are you? Home, thank you for waiting.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:13:04</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Last question goes to you. What's your question tonight for Kim?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:13:09</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Homef: Hello Kim, I'm from Australia as well and...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:13:13</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Good morning!
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:13:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Homef: Yes, it is very morning here. We've got Riccardo Bosi, who's putting out his ideas on how to run this country and change this country. And I would like information please in regard to his One Nation.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:13:39</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Now, I don't know this person. So I can't comment one way or the other - I wish I could, but I would have to look it up and try to figure out who he is and what he's doing. You know... One thing I will say, and I will give you this comment, and when people say like "One Nation," one this, one that - it depends on what they're talking about. If you're talking about people from a specific area uniting for something common, but underneath one umbrella, that's different. So, even in all the things that I've done over these years, I've always said, look, you know, you're from, for example, Australia. Do you need the Americans to come in there and tell you how to build a house? Do you need the Africans to come in there and tell you how to grow tomatoes? No you do not. You will figure it out yourself. It doesn't mean you can't share ideas with each other. But as far as having singular leadership, and all that kind of stuff - I just kind of wonder. Kind of reminds me of that guy, I talked to him once, the alleged King of England - I think he's from Australia - the alleged illegitimate King of England or something.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:15:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Correct. He was also being referred to as the Anti-Christ by many people in different circles.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:15:12</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Yeah. Well, I don't know. Only thing I can tell you is that in my book, there's one King, and he's not it. You know - not a Marduk, not an alien, not any of these people - even though they played those roles in certain ways. I still don't care. I look at - and not to be mean or anything - but evil or not, or Fallen or otherwise. Lower Astral or here, George - and you can answer this or not - there's a way to kill a demon, isn't there?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:15:49</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: There is.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:15:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Yeah. Everything bleeds and everything dies.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:15:54</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Yeah. Wonderful. Thank you so much. All right, Kim, that was wonderful. I thank you so much for your time.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:16:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Thank you, George.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:16:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: You're always amazing, and I appreciate you. Anything you'd like to share with everybody watching? A message for anyone who's watching right now?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:16:13</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: I'll keep repeating the same thing I tell you - because it's really important. Your consciousness matters. There are people that are going to act a little - as we go through these changes, you're going to see a lot of erratic people - kind of crazy times this last week or so. And you've just got to, and I know this is hard to do: just remember it's not their fault. It's coming from something else; it's coming from someplace else that's trying to maintain an influence here. And don't blame the person - try not to anyway. You know, send them a little love. Ask God, Source - however you say it - the Creator, AMG, Almighty God - to reach out to them and maybe give them a little bit of hope because they could use it right now. I mean, you'd be surprised, your vote matters. This is the one place where your vote does matter. You've chosen, continue to choose it every day and walk the walk.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:17:18</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Like, the Almighty's always watching, right? Because He's always watching. And I don't mean some of the time, I mean all of the time. Your consciousness, thoughts, matter. You can get really angry at people for doing the things that they do, or you can choose to say, "Look, they don't know any better." Or, hey, that politician talking to me that I'm really mad at right now, you know what? He probably has a demon walk in there, every single night when he goes to bed. So, you know, hey, there's worse things in this world. And of course he's going to say all that. You know? So take people for who they are. Just remember, the rest of us that don't know - that don't understand how to do this or feel like they don't have the time to spend reaching out - reach out for them. That's all I can say. Your intent and consciousness matters.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:18:18</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George: Agreed. Guys, for myself, I want to thank you all for watching. If you're new to the channel, thank you for being here. If you have something you want to talk about - if there's something going on in your life - you need prayer. You know, you may have an issue talking to Source, who I refer to as the Almighty. Message me, let me know. Let me know if I could pray with you; if I could pray for you; if I need to get a group of a bunch of soldiers and warriors here, on this channel, to come together on a day - and we pray for your country, we pray for you, your family. If you have something going on physically, spiritually, financially, personally, we help each other. It's not a prayer group. We're just a community, and we all wanna help one another. We need to stand fast with each other, stand behind one another, as human beings. And we need to help each other. So I'm there for you guys. Send me a message if you need any help. God bless you. Thank you, Kim. God bless you. Prayers to everyone. Have a wonderful week, and good night.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:19:19</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim: Good night, everyone.
