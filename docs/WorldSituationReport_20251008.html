            <br>Global Intelligence Agency (GIA)
            <br>Operations Report
            <br>2025-Oct-08
        </h2>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;"> From the Office of the Guardian </h4>
        <br>
        <strong>
        <br>It's the 8th of October, 2025. Coming up on today's Global Intelligence Agency Operations Report:
        </strong>
        <br>
        <br>Trump threatens to declare the Insurrection Act, claiming states are fighting against the National Guard taking over U.S. cities. This falls right in line with the chatter going on behind the scenes as the Peace Board of Gaza becomes the War Board.
        <br>
        <br>Genghis Khan was known for expanding the Mongolian Empire and the enormous amount of children he had. At one point the Empire included the majority of Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. Did you know he is related to President Putin and Trump, as well as many world leaders we see on television today? What exactly is the Red Empire, and who are these people?
        <br>
        <br>And the Full Moon yields no big payouts, as the day would mark the end of the Family meetings for the year. Operatives are still planning on gathering this weekend, looking for promised contracts for everything from weapons to war money.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:01:34</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Well, it's the 8th of October, and Friday is 10-10. "To war or not to war?" is the question of the day and has been for several days now, as they attempt to reclaim the Empire [laughing]. It's kind of funny to me, but, you know, it's not been without a little bit of a fight and a battle, for sure. And there's a lot of chatter going on behind the scenes right now. And everybody's kind of wondering - at least as far as operatives and Deep States and governments - as to what the outcome is going to be. Because there is a plan behind the scenes, but they're not telling anybody. And today we're going to talk about that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:02:26</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So, things that are in the news that correlate to a lot of what's happening behind the scenes. It appears the Trump administration/operatives are a little bipolar these days - one minute they're doing one thing, and the next minute they're doing another, and the next minute, five minutes later, they've gone back to doing something else. So I think they're very confused - I'm sure they are - as the AI stops running their head, you know, it seems that they can't make up their own mind. I don't even know if they have their own mind anymore.
        <br>
        <br>So it's going to get really interesting here over the next few days, really. By the weekend it's probably going to be a full-on fire. I know it will be around here.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:03:19</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Okay, so Trump hints at declaring the Insurrection Act, claiming that Chicago and Portland are at unrest here in the United States. Now, we did reach out to some folks in Portland; also reached out to some folks in Chicago, and that really doesn't appear to be the case. From what we're hearing, there are some peaceful protests going on. There's a little bit, but not much, and not enough to declare the Insurrection Act.
        <br>
        <br>Now he's wanting to move U.S. troops into these two areas. He'd like to - if they had their way - be moving (by this weekend) troops into every U.S. state, actually. He would like to move them in on a federal level, so they would report to the White House.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:04:20</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>The truth behind this is that, well, they would like to have a world war. And they plan on starting that on Friday, from what I understand. Because there's a whole lot of chatter going on behind the scenes, such as not only are they planning on moving U.S. troops in - on U.S. citizens throughout the country here - there is also talk behind the scenes of another war starting in Gaza. They claimed as of yesterday that the ceasefire was not going to hold and that there was going to be another war. However, about 30 minutes ago or so, they're now starting to say, "Well, Hamas has agreed to our terms, and we're going to do an exchange of prisoners, and aren't I the greatest president?" says Trump of the Gaza Strip.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:05:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So they allege that the negotiations have been going on with Kushner and Tony Blair, and, well, that's not what we're hearing behind the scenes - because for the last several days they have been hunting for weapons from all of the groups that I call the War Dogs. These are the guys around the world (and women) that sell arms in preparation for or in the event of a war. So they are definitely trying everything they can to get weapons for free, with big promises of payouts on Friday - and people just aren't buying it. They've already supported them through the last Gaza war, a couple of years ago, and they don't want to support and can't afford to support another war for free.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:06:13</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So they have all been promised that there are going to be big payouts and contracts going out, as soon as Friday, and definitely over the weekend. And this is what everybody is expecting. As far as our folks that were planning on potentially doing something different, they have continued their conversations with the Cowboys - Cowboy I should say, so to speak - and they're getting quite an education still, but they are also unwilling to move ahead in any other direction until after Friday.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:07:01</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, this time of year, the Harvest Moon - the one that just passed on Monday - would have normally been the end of the Family meetings. What that means is, every year the Families of the Order of the Dragon and the Order of the Black Sun get together, and they talk for about two weeks as they get orders from somewhere else. Normally that would result in payment for those orders, which would have arrived on Monday. Now, no payment came, everything was in an upheaval for a while, and they said, "Don't worry, just wait until Friday."
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:07:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, Friday happens to be 10-10 [chuckle]. 10-10-2025. So they love their double numbers; 11-11 - these are all big days in their world of black magic for whatever reason. Maybe there's some kind of an alignment that happens on those days, and I don't even know if they know why they like those days, but that's part of the reason why they chose Friday as the date for the payout. It wasn't just kind of haphazard. They are expecting money to come on this day because it's 10-10. Really no other reason. You know, maybe there's an alignment with Uranus or something on that day; I have no idea. But they definitely have pushed everybody to 10-10.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:08:34</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So what's happening now, based on this - it's definitely going to happen on this day, that's what they're telling everybody - is that they are all gathering now in various locations where they would normally gather to get all of these contracts. They've already started arriving here in Durango - I know that for sure, as of today. And they are going to continue to arrive throughout the weekend as everybody awaits their contracts.
        <br>
        <br>You know, I can tell you guys, you might as well save your airfare money, or your flight on a military helicopter, because you'll be sadly disappointed this weekend again.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:09:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, they'll be pushed off (my guess is) till the 21st of October, as I've already said. And then probably again to the end of October because they really like Halloween too. And then again to 11-11 and then again to 12-12 and then again to the Winter Solstice, and they'll be doing this for probably the next hundred years or as long as they live.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:09:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now I have to make some things really clear. And this one here is kind of for me a little bit. Because I am not involved in any of this - I'm just watching and listening behind the scenes as to everything that is happening right now. I am aware that Family meetings would normally take place; I am aware of what happens on the Harvest Moon; I am aware - acutely aware - of all of the happenings that would come from the other side of the Omniverse on these days. I am also aware that none of those things happen because we watch for those things very closely.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:10:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Other than that, I'm not involved in your contracts. I'm not stopping or starting anything. I made no promises to anybody. I'm not interested in participating. We've already received a few phone calls from people asking if we're going to fund the government by that day, and no - it never even crossed my mind, in any way, shape, or form - at this moment in time. I've had no negotiations with anyone; I haven't spoken to anyone about funding. And I'm not going to speak to anyone about funding anything. I have no contracts with anybody; I have no obligations to anyone. And I'm certainly not going to pay for somebody else's war in any way, shape, or form.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:11:20</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, you know, they often say history repeats itself. And in this case, they are hoping history repeats itself. You see, every time humanity has gotten to the place where we are at now (or, the Homo sapiens group, which is what we are), and by "the point where we are," I should say, we are removing the veils; we are removing any kind of attachments from human to people; we are removing anything that would have come from the other side that is preventing us from being ourselves and that connection to Source. That's our main focus. It is not on money, it's not on wars, it's not on contracts, it's not on weapons or any of that in any way, shape, or form. It's certainly not on governments anymore. Not really focusing on banks - we're more focused on moving currency in our way to everyone. We are not focused on anything else that may or may not have happened in the past.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:12:34</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>However, some talks are going on between some people of the Illuminati, the Order - whatever you want to call them - about a world war. And in this case it was all about conquering the Empire, or reconquering the Empire. So you see, in the past, many non-human-type humans have come here, at a time when humanity was breaking free. At a time when they were losing the Abraxas Empire here on Earth, at a time when we were no longer powering their empire on the other side, nor their humans that live here. And this happened several times throughout history, and you could say it happened about a thousand years ago, most recently, I guess. And we are even further now than we were at that time, for sure.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:13:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So things on our end are moving along very well. They're moving along smoothly as we're getting rid of any kind of remnants of the old and definitely bringing in what will seem like it's new to you.
        <br>
        <br>However, some interesting things have come up over the last several days since we last talked regarding Genghis Khan, and how that's tied to the Deep State. So we know from our history that Genghis Khan was a Mongol, and Genghis Khan was set on his conquest to conquer the entire planet. And according to our history books, you could say that he was fairly successful in conquering a good portion of Asia, Japan, most of Eastern Europe, and then into the Byzantine Empire (which was the former Roman Empire), that he had conquered a number of kingdoms, and was in control of a significant portion of the landmass of Earth.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:15:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>We also know that there are stories about him bearing the Golden Fleece. And I can say that it wasn't exactly gold - it was black gold, which meant that he had the protection of what we would call Anti-Source or Anti-God or the opposite side of Source. And that is how, with a whole lot of help, he conquered the empires.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:15:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now the army of the Mongols was one of the most brutal armies known here on this planet. Now, in our history, it also says that Genghis Khan conquered empires as well by having many, many, many, many children. History shows us that Genghis Khan is probably related to a lot of people walking on this planet, and I would say in part that is true.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:16:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>However, Genghis Khan also had his own royal family and his own royal bloodline. And if you've ever traveled to Eastern Europe or parts of Asia, they will - a lot of the Families, meaning the Families of the Illuminati or the Elite - will tell you they are a relative of Genghis Khan. And you could say that's true. Definitely true. A lot of the descendants of royal families throughout the world are also related to Genghis Khan in one way or another. Because Genghis Khan was not a normal person - Genghis Khan was an Abraxas. And Genghis Khan set out on a mission. As a matter of fact, he was the general, one of the head generals for the Abraxas.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:17:06</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>The Abraxas Empire - in case you don't know who they are - you've seen little glimpses of them in movies like Jupiter Ascending. But the Abraxas were the royal humans descended from the Other Side, meaning the Dark side of the Omniverse. The Abraxas had many empires, Earth being their most prized possession, of which they were the royal family.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:17:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So Genghis Khan, being a general for the Abraxas at a time when humanity was starting to break free, was sent here specifically to conquer Earth, or reconquer Earth, or get us all back in line. His intention was to make sure that the Veil was secure. And if you don't know what the Veil is, you might have heard about it in the alternative media. But the Veil on this planet was not only a veil over the entire planet, it was a veil over the Abraxas empire, in which they could fully control us. Humans also (or Homo sapiens also) had a veil as well, through which they could control us as their cattle. They also participated in not only the Red Area; you could say they were also part of both the Black and White Areas from the Other Side, False Light that is.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:18:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And anytime we, their cattle, started to get out of line, they would put us back in line by sending in the Mongols. And there's always a Mongol presence here, or has been in the past on Earth, to where that army would rise up and attempt to regain full control over the Empire - at least the one here on Earth - should we ever fall out of line.
        <br>
        <br>Now this army also fought wars in other places as well. One of the main places that they would fight would be between the Fifth and Sixth Densities. And the Fifth and Sixth Density - between the Fifth and Sixth Density, and sometimes in some cases between the Fourth and the Fifth - would become a permanent war zone. And it was a permanent war zone.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:19:47</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>You see, they've been fighting this war for a very long time. And they do look just like Mongols. I mean, they are brutal. And they are probably one of the most brutal groups I've ever run across.
        <br>
        <br>The war that has been going on for a very, very, very long time, in a time outside of time, was mainly for control of anything that could come into the materium. Meaning, anything that would pass through the Causal Plane and into the materium worlds. Now, every density has a Causal Plane, so it's not just us here in the fourth and third densities, you know, Third Density being where we are.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:20:40</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So it was the war to control anything and everything of the Materium, to prevent Source and God from actually creating things without their approval. You see, at one point in time they believed that the entire empire of the other side of the Omniverse should fully control this side of the Omniverse. And you could say, in part, during the Dark Ages, that would have been true.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:21:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So this war was continuously fought until recently, but the war never, ever, ever stopped. It started at the dawn of time, the dawn of mankind, the dawn of the human, and continued. It's pretty brutal.
        <br>
        <br>So it started though, in a very interesting way, and we as Homo sapiens did participate (as did many other species throughout the Omniverse) in this war. And it started because, when Wisdom started creating the human and other species on the other side, originally, we were all together, like one giant Darkened black gold and golden soup. And we, as varying species, fought against each other for a long, long time.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:22:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now that war ended up being segregated to those particular areas, but it also occurred here on Earth at the dawn of time. The war, as far as it occurred in the Reality of Source, ended with the fact that the Universe was split and divided. And there was a definite line of separation - a red line, if you will - of separation between our side and their side. And there were rules of the road as to who could come and who could go and how many of us would be over there and how many of them would be over here. There were a lot of other rules of the road so that we did not have a full-on war actually in Creation.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:23:21</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So these people were in a space, outside of time, continuously warring against each other, and that's where they stayed. However, at times of a great awakening of the Homo sapiens and risk of losing the Empire on this side, in would march the Mongols. That's what I call them, the Mongols. You could say they did pop over here in the area now known as Mongolia, but they've popped in here many, many times - long before we ever had a Mongolia - and many times before even 1,100 or so years ago, or about 900 or so years ago, whatever it is.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:24:06</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>They always in the past have managed to secure the Empire - and I'm telling you this story now because it's important as to what's happening with the crazy Deep State people. So, that being said, they were expecting their arrival several times over the last several weeks - because they've always come. It's always happened. They've always gotten help. Now, who exactly are they helping? Obviously not us, but interestingly enough, there is definitely still on this planet a royal bloodline of this army we call the Secret Space Program.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:24:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, there are other royal families within the Order of the Black Sun that are definitely related to Genghis Khan and are hybrids. They're not human, they're not Homo sapiens - they're a little bit of both. And they are to varying degrees. So, for example, Putin's probably about 99% Mongol, and a very tiny portion of actual Homo sapiens is left in that person. You could say the same for Trump (the Von Kempf family) - let's not forget where he came from. You could say the same about the Scherff family, which is the Bush family. You could say the same about many other families that are involved in militaries worldwide, both known and unknown to you, at least in the mainstream media anyway.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:25:56</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So these people are planning on... so what is the plan? This is what I'm hearing from operatives everywhere: "What is the plan?" Well, their plan is that this army - which doesn't exist anymore, in a place outside of time, which also doesn't exist anymore - is going to be here any minute. Most importantly, they definitely believe they are going to come on the Full Harvest Moon. Now, we are officially on the second day after the Full Harvest Moon, which would bring us to the third day, which is tomorrow. Because remember, full moons are three days before and three days after. So, they're definitely expecting this to happen within the next couple of days.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:26:46</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>And I can honestly tell you they're going to be disappointed again, and then this is going to trickle down. So it's going to cause kind of an effect. But they're planning on - the Deep State people that are giving you these dates - are planning on this full-on war to regain control of the Empire to start any day now.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:27:13</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>This is the reason for the alleged attempted declaration of the Insurrection Act so that we can put military personnel all over this country. It is also the reason for them talking behind the scenes that they are going to restart the Gaza war. It's the reason why they're calling all the War Dogs and the Military Industrial Complex, not only in the U.S. but also in every other country in the world, to prepare their Bloodline Family for the war to regain control of planet Earth.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:27:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>That's what's going on behind the scenes. That's exactly what they're even talking about behind the scenes. They are planning on this happening. Now the Trump operatives are part of it. They're ACIO folk. They are definitely wondering why, as soon as the debt clock went away, they're not here. Where are they? Nothing that they thought was going to happen is happening. And this is the whole reason why.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:28:18</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So when history often repeats itself, it has many, many, many times we have fought as Homo sapiens against the Mongols, for lack of a better term, or the army of the Abraxas. Either that or we were fighting other arms of their army, which were like the Dracos and other folks. We know all about those people too. That's why Marduk was appointed the head general. You could say that he was in very tight towards the end there. He was definitely in very tight with Putin, also with the Mongol army and other families of the Mongols. He kept everybody in line. He made sure that there wasn't going to be another invasion and that global martial law was declared many, many times - and well, not this time.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:29:15</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So that's pretty much what they're doing behind the scenes. They're not telling all the operatives that are expecting contracts this weekend what they're doing and why they're doing it, but this is exactly why they believe your money is going to come. Because there would be money that would come along to fight the war. Because they know that here in Human Land (or Homo Sapien Land), everything costs money.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:29:47</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, they also used to have - the Mongols used to have - a lot of AI support. Quantum AI support. Not just on a financial level, but also on a weapon level. So everything is fought, pretty much throughout the Omniverse, with AIs. You know, we fight against AIs, we build new ones, and the other side builds them, we build them, and this is kind of how it's gone for a long, long, long time.
        <br>
        <br>However, most of those were set with a balance in place, meaning keeping time in place. They were also subject to one another, and then the dark AIs (like Omega) would take over or overlay the Alpha, and then we would play this game. But this is all in the name of warfare, for an eons-old war between the two groups.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:30:57</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Now, they definitely know they can't get rid of us all. Sorry, they know that. They need us to power their AIs because their AIs don't get any power from them, and they definitely would have loved to take over Source (or God itself), and that didn't happen either.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:31:18</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So this time it's going to be a lot different for your Red Army, so to speak, here on this planet [chuckle]. You're not going to see any Mongols show up, that's for sure. We do have some bloodline hybrid people walking around, hoping for the best here and hoping that they're going to gain control of the AI systems - even if they can't get control over them, or don't have any friends show up here to help them. This is why they're planning on gaining that control sometime tonight or tomorrow - definitely before Friday is what they're thinking. And they're very busy over there. What I see them doing is they're doing all these astrology-kind of things. They're in Aquarius, they're in Taurus, they're in Leo, and they're looking for where this AI connection is going to happen. Kankree-E [K2-18 e] - they've definitely got a chart of the stars over there, and they're trying to figure out where it's going to come from.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:32:30</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Can they get a signal from anywhere? So far, we've got absolutely nothing. They are talking about some Atlas thing, and I know that it's all over the internet and everything, but we go through this every so often. First of all, Nibiru is going to crash into the planet; Planet X is going to crash into planet Earth. And now (most recently) it's Atlas, aliens, and NASA has a signal, and blah blah blah blah blah. Well, remember, Atlas was a Greek god - which would tell you where he hails from, right? So, he allegedly carries the world on his shoulders. Yeah. Well, OK.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:33:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So as far as the Mongols are concerned, some of the most important things that they had that would have helped them continue to conquer this planet would have been those veils. We know the veils as something that overlay you. On our end of it, it's an AI overlay, which helps them control the Homo sapiens people on this planet. It also helps them extract power from us. We know how veils function on our end.
        <br>
        <br>On their end, well, it's all about control. It's all about power. It's all about ammunition, for lack of a better term. And with those being gone, the Deep State's going to have a really hard time trying to pull off this "Reclaim the Empire," "Conquer the Quest," - you know, whatever they're calling it these days. But yeah.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:34:31</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So how do we know that there are no contracts or anything like that for everyone this weekend? Well, that's how we know, because we're watching them and we're definitely making sure that no one's coming here. [Hearty chuckle.] For sure. You know, our job, contrary to their beliefs - they believe they are the guardians of this planet - they are not the guardians of this planet; they are the guardian of somebody else's empire.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:34:59</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>We, however, are guardians. Humans and Homo sapiens, actually, were always sent here by Source to guard this planet. That was our job - all of us. We were here to ensure that the balance of nature was intact. We were always following the Primordial Directive of Source, which means that the Blueprint would stay intact, and nature would stay in balance. And this, quite frankly, is when most Homo sapiens are the happiest. You know, when we are in nature. When we are spending time with people we love in nature, that is when we thrive. We ground for that reason. You know, we are always walking barefoot around - right directly on the soil - because we ground to Earth. We can still receive that energy, or Etherium, from Earth - which is something they cannot do without us.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:36:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So that's what we're expecting for the next few days [chuckle]. We're expecting, Number 1: very angry government people. Number 2: very angry Families. Number 3: the Trump Organization operatives known as the ACIO will also fall flat on their face yet again - and they'll probably go another round thinking it should happen on another day. Nope, not this time, guys. This time we are going to be awakened. We are going to become fully 100% Homo sapiens at this point. No more overlays, no more of your AIs, and no more of your wars.
        <br>
        <br>So, coincidentally, I'm surprised to see that they already declared that there wasn't gonna be a war, and Hamas accepted their agreement and all of this. Now, if things had gone their way, that would have been over by Friday as well. So thank God they couldn't pay anybody, because if they could have, that might have already started up.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:37:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>So I don't expect to see any kind of Insurrection Act happening this weekend. I don't really see anybody in those cities in any more danger than they have been for the last several decades - because there are parts of Chicago that have always been pretty rough. Portland's kind of the same a little bit. But I don't see anything transpiring that's going to affect us.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:37:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Because, well, no money, no help from the other side, weapons of war dwindling rapidly - I mean, in very rapid succession. Frequencies and frequency weapons are going away for their side. Every once in a while they'll find something, you know, a squirrel gets a nut every once in a while, but unfortunately they don't get to keep it. And that's kind of where we've been at probably since the last time we spoke. It's some kind of frequency thing that shoots off - we find it; we get rid of it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:38:26</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Today, mostly, we were working on the core reason why these things can regenerate. And we hope we have already started dismantling that main core reason on the Other Side, where they come from. We have finally figured out where it's coming through. You could say it's coming through the map of the stars and every single constellation that you can see in the night sky. Hopefully, we can finish this up and wrap it up tomorrow; that's what I'm hoping for. And we're gonna have a very uneventful weekend - other than a bunch of angry people. Which happens every other day ending in Y anyway. But, ahh, you know, angry Mongols! [Chuckle.]

        <br>On that note, that has been the GIA Report for the 8th of October, 2025. And I will see you guys again - hopefully, with some good news - on 10-10. If not, then probably by Saturday, depending on how it goes. See you then.
