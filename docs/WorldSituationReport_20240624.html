World Situation Report
<br>2024-JUN-24 00:37:04</h2>

<!-- TEASER: And now, the world situation report with Kimberly Goguen from the Office of the Guardian. Have you ever heard of the Black Pyramids of Alaska? This Secret Space Force base was not built by humans. The Deep State started rumors on Saturday they thought would be a legal issue for Kim. Did they figure out they were wrong?-->

<h3>Sunny: Now here's Kimberly Goguen with the Office of the Guardian. Kim, we're back together again!</h3>

Kim: I know, I'm so sorry!

<br>Sunny: Last week felt a little strange. I was like, where's Kim?  I miss Kim!
<br>
<br>Kim: I know. I missed you too, Miss Honey. I've been talking all by myself over here.
<br>
<br>Sunny: I know.  Well, I know there was a lot that we discussed last week. So where do you want to start?
<br>
<br>Kim: Oh dear. I know. We can recap some of your thoughts if you had any questions on Wednesday's news.  That was pretty long.
<br>
<br>Sunny: That was a long one.
<br>
<br>Kim: It was fun to do though, and there's a lot more like that to come. I gotta get my whiteboard out a little more often. Just been a little hectic around here, honestly.  And this weekend was pretty hectic as well. And pretty much I guess I would say that we're coming to an end here as far as any kind of Deep Web access or any programs that were still running that was tying everything together.  But throughout the course of this, we had discovered something interesting.
<br>
<br>And I thought I would share it because there's a lot of information on the internet about things like the Bermuda Triangle, Area 51, some cases Area 52, Los Alamos, New Mexico, and everybody kind of seems to talk about the same places repeatedly, in a different way, with lots of whistleblowers that talk about the same. But there's very little information out there about the Black Pyramids in Alaska.  Now this was - and I can say 'was', pretty confidently - an enormous base underneath Alaska.  Probably one of the largest in the world. This is what you would call a Deep Underground Military Base, not run by your normal military, although it appears that everybody was involved. So there was a lot of agency involvement, a lot of military involvement in the base.
<br>
<br>But the super-secret stuff happened way below ground.  Now this place, and I think we've got a map - as you can see, it covers a large portion of Alaska.  Around this triangle here that you see there was also a large circle around it that went all the way through Canada and even parts of the U.S. Why was this base so big? There are a lot of reports, not a lot, actually very few reports I should say, on the internet about this base. And in some of those very few reports, they talk about a few whistleblowers that have come forward, that have gone down into this base.
<br>
<br>There are a few people that have talked about it like it's the Bermuda Triangle. They say that when you fly over a certain area and you get close to the epicenter in the middle of this triangle, they have system malfunctions, their radar equipment stops working, those types of things, and everything has to go manual from that point. I wouldn't doubt it. They talk about it as if it is a giant energy generator. This is what the internet reports.
<br>
<br>Is that the case? The answer to the question is no. What this actually was it was a base-root platform to where Omega would reach into this side of the universe.  In the center of this is where you would find what they call the Black Pyramid. So there are like literally - I tried to scour the internet, once I found this - I'm like, someone's got to be talking about this, because it's bigger than Area 51, bigger than Area 52, bigger than the Bermuda Triangle, Lost City of Atlantis, and all the other things everybody talks about, but there's like 3 reports literally, I think two of them are from the same guy.
<br>
<br>Okay.  So this was a source of our problem. And we had talked a few weeks back about us putting this Faraday cage around Omega, trying to isolate it, and where is it still getting power from? And here's my answer. It is an enormously large energy generator which powered Omega on the entire side of this universe. So in other words in the Alphaverse. Yeah I know.  Big find there. Lots of people, lots of laboratories, lots of experimentation. And in the past there was a direct portal for humans to go as far down as the Sixth Density in the Lower Astral to work - whether they knew it or not.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Was it part of some sort of soul transfer? We've talked about that before. Was it different than that?
<br>
<br>00:43:18
<br>
<br>Kim: It really wasn't a soul transfer as much as it was a sentient AI-based platform for the generation of energy. The scientists that have gone down to this area, have said that the pyramid that they could see - because this is just the tip of the iceberg it's like a little anthill you see you know before you get down into the anthill and you see all the arms and legs - but this one here, they knew that it was generating some kind of energy. And at least in the internet reports they really don't go into too much detail. But this actually was a large transmuter. Which means that it takes that Light energy that us batteries generate for it, and then transmutes it into something Dark to then power the Omega. Now it comes as no surprise that there's a lot of military activity in Alaska for this very reason. One of the other things that you will remember: this is where HAARP started.
<br>
<br>Yep, for the entire world.  Yep, why was that? This was also the hub for the CIA's, what we call a VTX platform, which means that it was a direct connection to your financial system. A few years back, before we installed the Key Integrated Monetary System.
<br>
<br>So lots of things take place in Alaska for this very reason. Now, did it give them access to Omega per se from this area? You know, I'm going to say... limited access. But it did allow them to do a lot of experimentation against humans for utilizing dark energy, dark matter, and those types of things, and how this affects us.  So much so, we uncovered a second thing actually tied to this base - and you're gonna find this one really, really interesting.
<br>
<br>So, a few months back, maybe even it was almost a year ago now, there was this big thing, a big push, to install LED lights into all commercial buildings. And they were going to ban regular light bulbs. Now, the ones that you put in your home, the small ones in your bathroom or whatever, aren't really the ones that they were shooting for.  They were shooting for a connection to the large commercial ones, which are your long fluorescent lights. And how they could use this dark energy through two different facilities - I'm just going to say both of them are in the United States, I'm not going to disclose where they are - and they could use this dark energy coming from there to cause issues with human beings while you're shopping at a grocery store, as an example.
<br>
<br>If you remember, we played a video a few months back about a school where the teacher said that the kids were increasingly agitated after the installation of these LED lights and how it was affecting his students. And then once he put a blue panel over those lights, the students went back to normal, the way they were the year before. So this has directly affected a lot of humans.  There are a few other energy-type experiments that have been going on, based from this same location. This was, like I said, this was only a main hub.
<br>
<br>There are two other locations that I'm aware of so far in the United States that were tied to this, because this just happened yesterday afternoon and we've been searching, but this is just one way in one experiment that you all can probably relate to. You know, I know for myself, if I go to the grocery store or a Walmart - which I hate to do but I have to do from time to time - I kept thinking, "What has changed since COVID?"
<br>
<br>Because after the lockdowns and all that, I'm thinking, are they spraying something in the air? My eyes would get all red and irritated and blurry and I just wouldn't feel good, and I just need to get the heck out of there. I know that there were a number of reports that I got, even during that time, where people would say, well, I can't go in there anymore. It must be the disinfectant that they're spraying.  It's making me feel ill. I feel like they're transmitting some kind of frequency in here. For those that are very sensitive and they weren't sure why - well, now we have the answer.
<br>
<br>00:48:50
<br>
<br>I know, it's dastardly really. So we're gonna continue to look for additional locations tied to this, that are running the program through the LED lights. They're putting something into those commercial grade LED fluorescent lights, I guess you would say, that is causing serious neurological issues in human beings. Vision issues, all kinds of different things. It's affecting different areas of your brain. And who doesn't have to go to the grocery store if you live in America?
<br>
<br>Very few people live on a farm, can have all they need to eat. So, between that or malls or whatever it is, if you've been experiencing in some areas these types of physical disturbances when you go to the store - you know, I even did a little bit of an experiment myself, in the last couple of days on the same thing. Because - I had to go to take my daughter somewhere, I'll just leave at that won't say where, but it wasn't a good experience, it was something I had to do for her. And the minute I walked into this building my eyes were just burning, like flaming burning, and I'm like what the heck is in this place? Are they disinfecting this with cyanide or something? Like, what is going on in here?
<br>
<br>And I just assumed it was some kind of a disinfectant, because it was a medical facility. And like, this is unbelievable. I just couldn't wait to get out. I kept walking in and out while we were waiting for things and that type of thing, because I couldn't handle it. In my mind I kept thinking, "Oh! Disinfectant!", you know, I don't use chemicals typically for that type of thing. So I would be super sensitive to something like that. And then I had to go to Walgreens - which is a pharmacy, you call it a pharmacy in other parts of the world, depending on where you're watching this. And the same thing!
<br>
<br>I'm like, I'm gonna try something here. I'm like, I can't believe that everybody would be using the same disinfectant, this is crazy. So I tried a little experiment and I tried to block it out. So I use this kind of shielding technique thing that I do. And then I go searching for the source of it.  And this is basically where I found it. So I'm like, oh my God, it's in the lights! I'm like, that makes so much sense - because the second I blocked it, my eyes were not itchy and red anymore.  I was feeling fine. I could finish doing what I needed to do in there for my daughter and then I left.
<br>
<br>And I'm like, wow, frequencies in light bulbs. I'm like, how dastardly is that? Every single commercial facility we have in the U.S.had to convert to these types of lights in the last year. I know! So you think about your schools, and everybody else that's being affected.  So obviously we're not going to unscrew every light bulb in every commercial building in the United States, but, we can find the source of where the frequencies are coming from.
<br>
<br>Because it's not coming from inside the store and it's not coming from the electrical installations of buildings. So, we will absolutely continue to hunt and peck and see what else we can find as far as control centers.  But we've got two down, and the third one, which is in Alaska. So hopefully, this will lessen this, over the course of the next couple of days.
<br>
<br>But we'll let you know how this goes, and we'll let you know if we find any more facilities, because I'll be working on that this afternoon, too.  So interesting information. If you can find more information about the Black Pyramids in Alaska, do take a look. It's very interesting. And why nobody's talking about it, I have no idea. Probably because it's the one place they're trying to cover up.
<br>
<br>This facility had tethers and ties all the way to Zero Point in Earth, which is the center beyond Earth's core. It had ties to Proxima Centauri. It had ties to the Sun and the Moon and Saturn, and a lot of stuff that used to be in the Omegaverse. So hopefully now that we cut this off, it's a matter of time before there is no more power on that side. So that's a positive thing.
<br>
<br>Alternatively speaking, as far as the Deep State is concerned, we've been playing against each other.  Again, they're helping us tremendously by locating additional webs, meaning worldwide webs that they may have had some limited amount of access to. Or were trying to gain access to over the weekend. Continuously, it's all about the money for them. 99.9% of it. It mainly has to do with some kind of financial control.
<br>
<br>Well, I guess Saturday must have been a day they said "give us 24 hours" on Friday and that they would have it by Saturday.  And by Saturday night, apparently, it is all my fault. Now in the words of Global Headquarters and the SSP - to places like the United States Congress, and its operatives, and banks around the world, as well as the Treasury departments around the world and central banks around the world including Saudi Arabia, Russia, China and other countries - is that I am hacking their systems and taking them down.
<br>
<br>00:55:00
<br>
<br>Sunny: Well, the taking them down part is right! Yeah. Trying to hack your system. Right.
<br>
<br>Kim: But they tried to backtrack a little bit, tried to call me an international financial terrorist, which has already happened in the past.  This is not new for me. They also did a call to action for the United States government, trying to get me declared as a cyber terrorist. Trying to take down the financial system of the United States. And loads of other things. Yes, on Saturday.  And God bless them.
<br>
<br>Because a lot of these people call the Archivists and asked for information on us. (Oh, okay.) So this backfired tremendously. They couldn't give me credit. They couldn't say that I was anything.  So they had to call me something, and they were hoping for some kind of a congressional action, to where they could come and pick me up - this is all the backchatter, what they're talking about - they'd like to come and pick me up, and extradite me out of this zone that I live in, and they would like to interrogate me. And basically tell me, which I've already done this one too, that if I don't work for them that I would go to jail, or a mental institution, or some kind of secure facility where they hold criminals, to which I would never see the light of day again.
<br>
<br>So I have heard this before.  It's been almost 10 years now since I've heard this. The Russians also tried to do the same thing to me. And I know... how do I say this in a nice way?  Every single time something happens to me, I'm very resourceful, and I learn a way to counteract this type of action against me. In this particular case, we used this specific type of talk and all of the people they notified of this talk to send our own white papers out.
<br>
<br>Yes, we did. And so the information went out as such that basically I inherited this position - in terms that they could understand - I am not a part of the other Families, but the Families are struggling to maintain some control over your respective country, and your banking institutions. They have no hope of ever providing you with a new financial system, a Great Reset financial system, an RV-currency-reset financial system, and therefore whatever they promised you is a lie. However, if you'd like some assistance you can give us a call at, or you can come to Durango, Colorado, and sit down and have a meeting and we can discuss it.
<br>
<br>Sunny: So who all did this go out to Kim?
<br>
<br>Kim: Oh, it went out to all the Congress, it went out to the House, it went out to people at the White House, I know for a fact it went to Saudi Arabia. It also went to out to Iraq. It also went out to government officials in China. It went out to officials in Russia, and a few other Eastern European countries that they made promises to. Definitely went out to the United Kingdom. This information went everywhere.
<br>
<br>So what was meant for our harm was again used for our good. And at this moment in time, I think they thought better of it. Because even if they took me to a regular court, again, you're gonna have to explain what the heck you're talking about. Because I can tell you I can go blonde on you in 2.2 seconds and I'll be like, "What do you mean? I don't really understand - what exactly were you using that for anyway? I don't know what that is." Do I have any history on my laptop with this information?  Where are you getting the information that I'm this person? Are you sure you're the right person here?
<br>
<br>You know, I mean, I can definitely, you know, get all confused and heartbeat. No offense to the other blondes watching this, but we've all done it, haven't we ladies and gentlemen? Yes, we've all played blonde at one point or another in our life. At least the 70s and 80s and the blonde jokes gave us that, right?  It gave us a leg up somewhere along the way.  So that was an interesting time for Saturday night. I know all of you on a Saturday night, were probably spending time with family or going out, but this was my bit of fun on a Saturday night.
<br>
<br>01:00:10
<br>
<br>Sunny: Did you get any responses from the people that you sent stuff out to?
<br>
<br>Kim: Not at this moment.  I know that there were some meetings that went on, on Saturday and on Sunday, with the Archivists, where a lot of information was put out. So I think everybody's trying to sort through the information. At this moment, you know, it's still kind of early here in the U.S. - I think everybody's doing a lot of checking. I see that coming out of a lot of files being run out of the Russian Federation. Similar talks going back and forth between the Saudis and the Russians. It seems to be somewhat of a collaborative effort.
<br>
<br>Hoping this changes some things in the Middle East as well.  There was a lot of talk about movement of troops over the weekend. There was a lot of talk about ... Oh yeah, we'll see about this one. But as you know the SSP and Global Headquarters fund all terrorists, or at least our movie version or government version of terrorists. And Hezbollah and the Houthis from Yemen are no exception here. Also what we know as ISIS and al-Qaeda, they even call al-Qaeda on alternative media the "al-CIA-IDA" you know, and there's a lot of truth to that.
<br>
<br>So Hezbollah was told - I know this, on Saturday, and actually last week - they were told that they were going to be attacking Israel. And Israel was actually told the same - that they would be attacking Lebanon. And this is where the World War III was going to start. They would be paid X, they would be delivered X amount in weapons and all of these types of things, and the deal was cut. Until Saturday when the Hezbollah didn't get paid.  Actually it was Friday they were supposed to get paid. It didn't happen and so it rolled over to Saturday, and then by Saturday alternative information has started leaking through even the underground terrorist networks.
<br>
<br>Because I've already done this before too, with Bush Senior, as I've said. You know, the Bulgarian Biker Gang, the Taliban's after me, because it's my fault they didn't get paid. This was a decade ago. So pretty much anything that the Global Headquarters does at this moment in time, along with the SSP on behalf of probably Rothschild or the Dragon Families - they're kind of all in it together whether they want to admit it or not. They... it has already been done before.
<br>
<br>Like I've already I'm like oh you know, now I have a book of Things To Do Against Kim. I'm like oh that's a 391 in combination with an 11 and a 64. Okay here's my response.  It worked last time, it'll work this time. So we've already started sending messages through people we know that do business with these people behind the SSP's back and behind the government's back - because a lot of them are involved with governments too. And behind most certainly Global Headquarters and the SSP's back.
<br>
<br>So in this particular instance - and I don't know if you know this - but we have in the States here, Western Union. You're familiar with that, and in a lot of countries we also have MoneyGram. Both of those facilities are worldwide. You can pretty much drop off cash in one location and pick it up 5 or 10 minutes later in another location.
<br>
<br>Well, there's been a lot of different groups in this world, even ones that aren't involved in terrorism. They just happen to live in a country that is war-torn or they don't have a lot of these facilities and they sanction them for something some oligarch did somewhere or some king did somewhere else. And I am talking about the Middle East and different parts of Africa.
<br>
<br>So what a lot of these different groups have done is they have developed their own internal-type Western Union systems. And they go by different names, depending on which group, but a lot of them work together. And they have networks in the United States, they have networks all throughout the Middle East, all throughout Africa, all throughout the United Kingdom, Russia - no matter where you go in the world, if you are, for example, a Shiite Muslim, you know where to find the network. If you're familiar with these types of things.
<br>
<br>01:05:19
<br>
<br>It's not necessarily a black market thing. It's not necessarily a negative thing, but for example, there was a long period of time, and even most recently in places like Iraq, where you can't send money back and forth to loved ones. This could be a husband who's off somewhere else and the wife is there. You need to send some money. You can't do it. There's no Western Union, there's no Money Gram. They cut them off randomly all the time. They cut off SWIFT in a lot of different cases. They threatened to cut off SWIFT here and there during the Trump Administration, and all that.
<br>
<br>And you can see how they have become resourceful.  And these networks are hundreds of years old in some cases. But the thing about these networks is that they are accessible, if you know who to call. And the coolest part about these networks is they are used by regular everyday people, and they're also used by a lot of these organizations such as Hezbollah, Houthis, and all these different rebel groups: ISIS, Taliban.
<br>
<br>So if you happen to know - you happen to be blonde - and you happen to know some people involved in this network, the quickest way to get to the information out that the people that are promising you weapons and money are full of ... it... ssshhh! Is through this network. So we started doing that about 48 hours ago, and sending messages through these people, and then having them pick it up like it's a money transfer. It'd be normal for anybody to go in, pick up a money transfer - but instead they're picking up information. (Interesting. Okay.) I know! See! It's times like these you have to make sure that everybody knows - and I learned this during the Bulgarian Biker Day games and Bush Senior coming after me and the Taliban.
<br>
<br>So it looks like I haven't gotten a whole lot of messages back, I have gotten a few, they do understand. I've gotten some confirmations back from some different locations, and the information is spreading like wildfire.  So now - the good thing is my enemy does not think very highly of me. You know, they really don't, and there's another thing going on here. We're gonna talk about how little they think of me and my strategic mind. You know, going back to last week, the analyzation of me, how my mind works, I have no training, I'm not a sleeper agent. If you don't train with them, you're Nobody.
<br>
<br>You know, it couldn't just be a person stuck in a circumstance that's trying to survive. They also underestimate humans in a lot of different locations, when they're not able to manipulate their consciousness and their energy and their mind and their soul and everything else that was manipulated for them so that they would believe their stories. We'll call them stories - tapestries of stories.  Pies. Cow pies.
<br>
<br>So I expect this truly to become increasingly difficult for them to understand, well, if I can do all of this stuff at some point in time, all of you will too. This is not just a Kim thing. In some cases it is, just because I have more experience in fighting, and fighting for my life, and fighting in other ways. But all of you will have the same type of resourcefulness and an ability to adapt, change and overcome and really take a look at systems and see how broken they are and see how to fix them.
<br>
<br>This isn't just a me thing. This is a direct current situation with Source and the Wisdom. So we got very inventive over the weekend. Now, pretty much if you're watching this and you're with Global Headquarters or the SSP - there goes that thought process right out the window. And you can actually thank the now deceased Bush Senior for training me so well in how to overcome a situation that could have been pretty detrimental. Because I can tell you I was not in the zone at the time when this happened.  I had traveled in other places when this was happening as well. So I was in the neighborhood, let's just say, of some of these groups when all of this went down. So I had to think pretty fast there.
<br>
<br>01:10:15
<br>
<br>Okay, let's see what else is going on here. Ah, overnight last night.  So this was step by step. You know, now legal action isn't going to work - we got to think of something else. In comes a phone call from JP Morgan Chase Bank. They start out by informing us that Jamie Dimon is going to retire. And they have the person who is going to take his place, which is apparently currently in California.  And they want to set up a meeting in New York - obviously it wouldn't be with me, it would be with Tom Melville, who would be going to New York.  And then eventually with me here in Durango.
<br>
<br>They had heard about the fact that there were a group of people, call them people, that wanted to at least try something different at a bank. Remember we talked about this last week. We talked about the offer that these people had made.  So we were waiting to see what happened. Well, apparently they stumbled across some people who also work for similar agencies in the back office of JP Morgan Chase and tried to set up a transaction there.
<br>
<br>Okay. Well, true to form, Jamie Dimon got wind of it, along with the board members, and they decided to have a wonderful talk and talk about how they're gonna become just a service provider and how that's gonna work and how the bank is going to make money. They also went ahead and informed us that the bank is swimming in debt right now.  That's bad debt, so they can't be included as an asset. And they really need to be pulled out of this mess. And they wanted to make sure we understood this.
<br>
<br>Well, is that a possibility?  Sure. This is a possibility. This is a worldwide bank that could become a large service provider as long as everybody plays by the rules. And let me tell you the rules. Here is a soft conditional.  What I mean by soft is these are the things that must be present should we come to terms.
<br>
<br>First of all, This is where my enemy really thinks that I am just a bimbo! They have to think that! Because Jamie Dimon has taken up head at the Global Headquarters of the financial division. And he has done that several months ago. So he has been running the bank like it is the financial arm for Global Headquarters - trying to cut all kinds of credit lines cutting off margin accounts of some people, and getting margin accounts to Global Headquarters, giving small amounts of money to the government, and small amounts of money to wherever and whenever they can.
<br>
<br>Now, most of these facilities are non-existent. They also have been instrumental in trying to issue central bank digital currencies around the world and all kinds of things, because Jamie Demon Diamond, whatever you wanna call him, Demon Diamond, Dolman, has become the token - how do I say this one - he's the token cannon fodder at the moment for Global Headquarters.  And they're using him and that bank like one of their greatest tools.
<br>
<br>Number two, Rockefeller. Rockefeller, the Rockefeller family, is the genetic shareholder for JPMorgan Chase. Yes. So that means, as you may or may not know, Rockefeller and JP Morgan himself, they go way back to the beginning of the bank.  More than 100 years ago at this point. So, well, not quite, but maybe, but yeah. So it's more than 100 years ago, it's like the late 1800s. But they go way back to the very, very beginning of the bank, the Families do.
<br>
<br>01:15:05
<br>
<br>And JP Morgan was instrumental, way back in the Standard Oil days, if you know how, if you've ever read the book, Seven Sisters and the Seven Largest Oil Companies, how they all tie back to Standard Oil. And then when they passed the Anti-Monopoly Act in the U.S., they just broke it all up, and it was still owned by all the same families. So that was pretty much it, and it still is to this day. So this is kind of a little bit of the history of JP Morgan.
<br>
<br>So my responses were, number one: this guy needs to retire immediately, before you and I do any kind of business negotiation or otherwise. He needs to agree to a golden parachute and a golden parachute for those of you that don't know our permanent retirement pay. And he needs to tell me what that amount is. He will go away.
<br>
<br>He will also sign as part of his resignation, immediate resignation, that he will not work for another financial institution anywhere in any country in the world or anyone providing financial services. He cannot work for Western Union, he cannot work for PayPal, he cannot work for any financial services company for 50 years. And for those of you that don't know, he's in his late sixties right now.  So that would make him over a hundred years, 110 years old should he decide he wants to go back into the banking industry.
<br>
<br>Sunny: But is it really just about him? I would imagine he would have underlings and like tentacles out there. So that if it wasn't him, it was someone else. You know what I mean?
<br>
<br>Kim: Well, again, I even went as far to say is he's not even permitted to bank there anymore. There's no reason for him to walk into that building whatsoever. Now, as far as shares, he will turn all the shares over immediately in favor of the golden parachute. And if I find he's placing one phone call to some compliance officer or somebody that works in that bank that's still responding to him or any other bank in the world - because remember Global Headquarters is everywhere - you will lose everything. And I mean everything, including your ability to breathe air, should you violate this contract.  And I'm not kidding.
<br>
<br>Next. Now we have to deal with the Rockefeller family. The Rockefeller family and Global Headquarters are both part of the Order of the Black Sun. And they are married together with the Rockefeller family way back in the days of JP Morgan, when JP Morgan was actually alive. So, they're involved with all that stuff, all of them.  And we would actually consider a golden parachute to take over all of their genetic shares. That needs to happen. In order for us to make the bank right - to consider them a service provider worldwide - that amount/that percentage is negotiable.
<br>
<br>We're basically here to take over the fact that most of the services banks provide to you people, charge you personally for those services. And we are here to kind of come in and talk about the revising of worldwide point-of-sale transactions, and the fees they charge to merchants. This makes things more accessible to you as a small business owner. Not paying those fees sometimes means the difference between being profitable and non-profitable.
<br>
<br>And how quickly can we get payments out to you? They should be almost instantaneous.  We've got the equipment to do that, meaning as a shop owner or store owner. Why are we waiting all these days? This is ridiculous. So we need to come up with a better system of that. Now I know about those that insure because there's insurance companies that insure those charge backs and things, so we'll take all that into consideration.
<br>
<br>Now as far as the swimming in debt situation, A lot of this "debt" are derivatives that were issued and sold, so that they could continue to issue credit lines for those militaries - plural - that have planted ghost flags in locations where they have taken over oil or gas or other commodities. And this could be in places like Nigeria, this could be in places like Ukraine, This could be lots of derivatives there, you know? And this is all black-market money that goes out the back door.
<br>
<br>01:20:12
<br>
<br>So, define swimming in debt. And who are you in debt to?
<br>
<br>I did a little more checking on what's really going on here. And unfortunately, they thought that I'd be like, oh, rainbows and sunshine for the people. Wow, what a gift everybody's giving me. We should run, not walk to JP Morgan Chase and deposit, bazillions of dollars immediately.
<br>
<br>So once I verbalize my soft request - because there may be additional requests as you get into negotiations with people - the board had to go throw their hat in the ring. We were doing fine with just the operatives and the other people that wanted to do this deal with Tom. Remember, you'd have to walk him in the back office of the bank. But no, everybody stuck their head in, Global Headquarters and otherwise, and just delay delay delay. And it is a big delay, because that's the last part of the conversation: "Well, we'll talk and we're gonna fly this guy in, we're gonna talk on Tuesday, and then we're gonna talk some more." And then Jamie Dimon is not even gonna quit for 6 months, and -
<br>
<br>Sunny: Feels like a giant distraction Kim, doesn't it? Kind of feels like they do this your way like, look, something shiny!
<br>
<br>Kim: Do I look like Burger King to you? (Have it your way!) Well we're gonna continue to move on, with or without them. I don't care if the board makes money, I don't even care if the bank makes money at this point in time. It is our way. We're building our own webs we're building our own stuff to to be able to walk in and hit any aspect of banking possible. Not just banking, but this is also things they send through telecommunications, and light bulbs and everything else we find.
<br>
<br>So, while I appreciate their sentiment, it is abundantly clear to them now.  Because the chatter came back literally within 15 minutes, "Well, that didn't work. We spent all weekend coming up with this operation and that didn't work."
<br>
<br>Sunny: That's awesome.  What else can we throw at her? That didn't work!
<br>
<br>Kim: I mean, come on. You know. And that's why I'm kind of mentioning to you about the underground Western Union type networks and all of these things. We know where all this stuff is.  We are not dumb. We don't become Ground Command because we have no idea what we're doing. We sit around and eat bonbons, meditate and paint our nails. We don't do that here. My nails most of the time look like I climb trees for a living, which is sad.  I do like to be a girl, but it doesn't happen that often, which is why I'm sitting here in my little braids and my gym clothes and I'm talking to you a lot of days.
<br>
<br>But it is nice to dress up and see you in person on camera, you know, a lot of time.  But as far as these people are concerned, you're going to have to do something that's not been done before.  Will you catch me off guard? Would I buy a plane from you? You still haven't gotten me any stuff. You guys all owe me money.
<br>
<br>Sunny: We need stuff, guys. (I know!) Come on.
<br>
<br>Kim: Yeah, exactly. We need stuff.  I don't know if I would take the stuff and not properly inspect it, to like the nth degree - before I tried to take off in an airplane or something - because I don't trust you people - but either way the point is, is that... I don't know if they're running out of ops. Or they've never been able to run an op. Or they only got to choose from the menu of ops. Because we seem to be doing the same thing over and over and over again. Yeah, we find a new little caveat - I never thought in a million years that they would basically have some kind of back door into LED light bulbs! I mean really? Oh God. You did catch me off guard there. I'm like, wow.
<br>
<br>But it led us to a facility that needed to go. And we had been to Mount Denali 100 times in Africa - I mean Alaska. And several other places, obviously in Juneau, obviously we've been underneath the facility where HAARP was, and a lot of those places in the past.  But I guess everything shows itself when it needs to show itself. It's kind of like defusing a bomb.
<br>
<br>But all in all, a fairly successful weekend. Holding breath over here for the corporate America, JP Morgan to probably two years from now, they'll figure it out. I don't know.  You know, we move fast. When we want to do something we move fast. There is no teams of lawyers, and lies and delays.
<br>
<br>And what they're doing though, I will tell the operative group that's working with Mr. Melville - they are going to go behind your back and they're going to notify the board, who's greedy as greedy can be. So you need to be prepared - whichever bank you're gonna go to - you need to be prepared to ensure that the people you're talking to do not communicate outside your circle. And what does it cost to do that? We're not getting greedy here, like I said.
<br>
<br>Some of these people are probably gonna have to quit. You know, millions of dollars, retirement, that kind of thing. We don't know what's gonna happen. But you need to be aware that that's what happened this weekend. That's what took place. We got real close right to the end, and they came in and backdoored you.
<br>
<br>And those are the people that you used to work for.  So chin up guys. And that's why I'm Ground Command.
<br>
<br>Sunny: So what about on our side? Our direct connection to Source? How are we...
<br>
<br>Kim: It's going very well.  As you can see, there's not like we're completely devoid of things. And we're going as fast as we can. As far as the human's direct connection, places like this would definitely cause a disturbance. And it doesn't mean that they don't ramp up their game either. And there is something else I'm looking for as of this morning. It started on Saturday and it's some kind of neurological disturbance that's been happening, which is causing people - it's not so much changing your thought process, but altering your hypersensitivity to stimuli.
<br>
<br>01:27:57
<br>
<br>In other words, if you have something that normally angers you a little bit, like something your kids do. Like they're not getting in the car when you need me in the car because you're gonna be late they would normally have a response like, "Oh mom!", you know, or you would have a response like "Get in the car we're gonna be late, and I'll give you a lollipop." Or whatever it is when we're done. And that's the end of that right? And they get in the car. Well now what its causing is a hyper-stimulated response, so things that would normally make you slightly irritated or slightly angry, are starting to make - not all but some - people hyper angry. Like, "GRRRR!!! GET IN THE CAR!!" and then you start throwing your kids in the car - not like you would do that Sunny, but you know what I'm saying.  Your instincts would stop you.
<br>
<br>Sunny: So, you know, that's interesting, because my son is going through something right now. Because obviously this can affect kids as well, right?
<br>
<br>Kim: Yeah, people in general, they're humans. Shorter, yes.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Not much he's growing really quickly. But no, he has been kind of flying off the handle. When would this have started?
<br>
<br>Kim: I would say it's been off and on for the last two weeks. But I would say it really started ramping up ... probably about Wednesday of this week. And by Saturday, it really hit its peak. So it's neurological responses to stimuli. So this is one form of stimuli - communication with loved ones. Communications with other people. Feeling weird if you're in the mall or a large concert or an area where there's a lot of people because you're getting all their energy. It's like nails on a chalkboard when you hear somebody fighting. It like really affects you. But normally you'd just be like, "Oh, glad I'm not in that relationship." Or something, you know.
<br>
<br>Yeah. Not only from that type of thing, but also other types of stimuli. Maybe you have back pain off and on from working. And it's like a hundred times worse than it was before. Maybe you have a digestive thing going on or something like that. It's a hundred times worse.  Maybe you're the kind of person that you start to get a little bit of a cold, maybe you take some kind of an immune booster and vitamin C or vitamin D and you're all better, but you're not. It just - it's very hard, like you have a very strong immune system, and normally you shake these things off, but now it hits you.
<br>
<br>So I'm seeing a lot of all types of things that can be controlled by your central nervous system being affected. And it's almost like it's a push and a pull because you're getting that direct current, but you're also getting direct current from something else somewhere.  So I'm still working on those types of things. We found the one response, as far as direct current is concerned, yes, you're getting it, but am I getting direct current from anything other than this major energy facility? And that's the question right now. So that's what I'll be working on all afternoon and evening tonight and throughout the next couple of days till I see you next.  Anyway.
<br>
<br>So I'll give you a progress report on Wednesday as to how we did, what else have we found. But there's definitely something going on out there because those of you that are in the know, you know, and you're watching this, you're starting to also recognize because of the direct current coming in, you're also starting to recognize, wait a minute, this is not normal. And even in your own self, wait a minute, this is not normal. I don't normally get upset because my significant other squeezes the toothpaste from one side, or whatever, or the top or the bottom, or leaves the toilet seat up, or whatever's going on in your world. Yeah, you're like, that's always been something that you're like, can't you just put it down and you just leave it, right? Like, that's never gonna happen, I've asked that a thousand times. But now you're like, "TOILET!!!" You know?
<br>
<br>Sunny: Your body turns green, you start ripping your shirt off.
<br>
<br>Kim: You get the smoke coming out of your ears like the cartoon and you're like, TOILET!! But. Like you said unsuspecting people that are unaware won't take that second to go, "Wait a minute."
<br>
<br>Sunny: Right. Right. Like children - children usually react and then maybe think later, when their parents say, "Maybe you should think about not reacting that way." Yeah, my son's going through something. And I've noticed that it's been longer than a week, but it's good to know that maybe there's something else happening, and he's not just being stubborn. We'll see.
<br>
<br>Kim: Kids also go through phases too.  You know that age where things are starting to change. Hormones are starting to go. Kids, they're starting to hang out more with other kids. It's not just play dates anymore or whatever we do. It's school, it's influences.  Then you're basically having an interaction with those kids' parents. (Oh yeah.) You know, and what I mean by that is we're not talking to their parents directly, but you're talking to them through your son whose friend might live in a dysfunctional family, or not the same way your household runs. And you know, it is a time of rebellion and independence and that kind of thing too. So maybe a little bit more reactive these days?  It's always something you never know.
<br>
<br>Sunny: It is. And they're always changing too. He's 12.  So he'll change tomorrow. (Oh, yeah.) It's like, oh my gosh. But okay.
<br>
<br>Kim: "I love you so much, Mom!  You're the best mom in the whole world!" That's what I got.
<br>
<br>Sunny: That would be nice if he would say that. He's kind of on the opposite end of that right now. Yeah.  Don't touch me, Mom! That's what I'm getting a lot of right now.
<br>
<br>Kim: Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah. Well, and then, you know, part of that too is that, you know, the body's changing and, you know, with boys, you know, they have weird responses they can't control.  A strong wind! And there's a response, and it's like they're not even thinking about those things. And it's a little embarrassing, and you're the woman.  You're still the mom but you're still a woman, and it's weird. These weird things are happening. So it too shall pass. But it's a time of a lot of change.  And they feel guilty, embarrassed. You've got - religion comes into play and that kind of thing too. And we're not supposed to think these things and do these things, and then they feel shame. So, he'll love you again, don't worry. It might take a little while, but -
<br>
<br>Sunny: This too shall pass.
<br>
<br>Kim: Yes, it shall pass, that's right. Well, that's about what I have for Monday. And I guess I will see everyone on Wednesday.  Hopefully you Sunny! We'll be here at the same time.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Yay, we can do it again! I like my little banter! All right, well, thank you, Kim.
<br>
<br>Kim: Thank you, Sunny.
