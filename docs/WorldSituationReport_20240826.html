World Situation Report
<br>2024-Aug-26 News</h2>

<br>00:30:25

<!-- TEASER:-->

<h3>And now, the World Situation Report, with Kimberly Goguen from the Office of the Guardian. Society's systems are breaking down. What are you going to do about it? Even the Deep State can't manage to maintain control. Today you will learn the real reason and what we need to do for humanity to survive.</h3>

<br>Deep State labels on food and pharmaceuticals are not what you think. The game is rigged. What's in our food? And compartmentalization was the name of the game for the tyrannical leadership that once existed on this planet. Let's take a look at the bigger picture because it appears the Deep State cannot.
<br>
<br>Sunny: All this and more in today's World Situation Report. Now here's Kimberly Goguen with the Office of the Guardian, and she's live, everybody! Hi Kim.
<br>
<br>Kim: I am. I told you you're going to see a lot more of me.
<br>
<br>Sunny: I love it. I love it. Good to see you!
<br>
<br>Kim: It's good to see you too, Sunny. In person. Well, not in person but at least on the same screen.
<br>
<br>Sunny: How are things over the weekend? What's going on?
<br>
<br>00:31:41
<br>
<br>Kim: It's a little crazy, and I've gotten a lot of comments from other people saying their weekend was a little crazy too. It seemed like a lot of bad energy, a lot of Deep State issues, a lot of, I mean, Saturday was really rough. Yesterday wasn't so bad; it wasn't terrible, with little bits here and there. Today, they're pretty upset. And that's kind of why I wanted to explain a few things today. And it's not only for them; it's also for you, because we keep doing this roundy-round kind of thing; the Deep State does this, we shoot it down, they try this, we shoot it down, or it's just a malfunction on their part, which shoots it down, and nobody really understands what's going on here. As far as we go, I wanted to explain a few things because it's important to understand that even if we don't have a Deep State, what are we going to do? And I've touched on this a number of different times, and I'm going to explain it in more detail now to you because we're getting to that point where I'm not so sure they're going to be around, and if they're not around, whether they are or they are not, we need to find a way to survive because their leadership isn't holding up anymore.
<br>
<br>00:33:06
<br>
<br>Even if we were going in the wrong direction, even if we were Dr. Evil, even if we wanted the world to explode, we're still going in the wrong direction. So what I mean by that is, humanity, we get angry a lot. We get angry at the things they do. We scroll through. Is there going to be a hurricane? Are we all going to die tomorrow? Are we going to have all these issues? Look, now it's this pox and that pox, and here and there are pox pox. But yet we're not doing anything. We go through, we get angry, and we're not doing anything. So let's just say they stop spraying us. Let's just say, because that's something new, they started again, which stopped for a long time, which is going to prove my point today. But for us, we need to be more prepared than we are. And everybody will say, well, I'll get prepared when we're all flush and we have plenty of money and we have nothing to worry about and all of that, and that's great, but throwing money - having run several businesses myself, I can tell you right now that you can throw money at a bad business and that's not going to make the business good, and the same thing works for the entire world. What is going to happen when we are the government?
<br>
<br>00:34:31
<br>
<br>And I don't mean we're going to have White Houses, and you're going to see yourself tomorrow on TV and doing White House press briefings, in whatever color your house is, wherever you are in the world. What I mean by that is, what are we going to do when we are "semi-self-governing?" And how many people in this world don't watch YouTube? They don't watch our news; they don't watch anybody else's alternative media news. What are we going to do? Now, right now, we recognize the fact that there are a lot of things in the world that are not good. And we give a lot of energy, whether we want to or not, to those things that are not good. And I'm going to point out something before we show this clip because this is important. You know there's a saying amongst different religions that God helps people that help themselves. And we're going to take that to another level and help you to really truly understand what that means because, you're right, we're all running on Source Energy right now. And we're all running on Source Essence; we're all running; we have an organic soul; it's not being replicated; it's not in multiple dark timelines; we're starting to see those memories of other times and other places dissipate, no matter how hard the Deep State tries, and I'll explain to even them why that's not going to work. But we need to put the effort into what Source is trying to do for us right now and not the effort into all the things that are bad or wrong.
<br>
<br>00:36:15
<br>
<br>I made a comment on the news; I think it was last week sometime, and I made mention of the fact that we are spending way too much time complaining or listening to other people complaining constantly about all the things that are going wrong or could go wrong. Well, the Deep State counts on it. They count on the fact that if they put this information in the mainstream media and other places, that you are going to make it happen. You are going to, whether you know it or not, subconsciously or consciously, you are calling Source at that moment in time, and you are saying, "Source, we'd like to have that." And you're expecting God, Source, or whatever you call It, to save you. But he's like, "But you're asking me for this. You're spending a lot of my energy on manifesting this situation."
<br>
<br>00:37:21
<br>
<br>And I keep telling you, you don't know how powerful you are. You know, as human beings, we want the world to be a different place. If you're watching this, you want the world to be a different place. And it doesn't mean you're going to be the next Bill Gates of the correct type of computer system or something, but you have a lot more power than you think you do to manifest the outcome for all of humanity. You know, what if I told you that you, 100 people, just select 100, insert 100 people here, or you're watching YouTube videos and you can see that there's been 10,000 views on this YouTube video and it's all about Monkeypox or it's all about the Deep States doing this. It's all about we're going to get locked down again, or whatever it is - that means 10,000 people are responsible for bringing this into our reality. Scary, isn't it?
<br>
<br>Sunny: It is.
<br>
<br>00:38:15
<br>
<br>Kim: You know, I get a lot of people - and it's hard, guys, trust me. I know. It's hard to live in a world where you feel like you are out of control. Meaning you have no control of the outcome of your life; of your paycheck; of your money; of your currency; of where you live; what you do; you have no control about whether or not you can travel; you could show up at the airport with a perfectly good passport having never done anything in your life and they can tell you, "You can't board that plane." You feel like you have no control, but you have so much more control. You just have to believe. And what I mean by that is I'm not telling you a fairy tale here, like, well, you just click your heel three times and everything's going to be great, and that's not what I mean by that. I mean, you have to believe in yourself. That's the first thing. "Am I really having this conversation with Source?" "Am I really having this conversation with God?"
<br>
<br>And then the other thing too is trying to control the outcome. Meaning you believe that if you had more money, your world would change. You could build that business you want to build. You could farm that land you wanted to farm. You could buy that farm that you want to farm or whatever it is you want to do in life. I can make those widgets. But in reality, you're saying that this is the only way this is going to happen. That is what you're telling the universe, and that's what you're telling Source. That this is the way. And if it doesn't happen the way you want it to happen, then you give up; you stop. You stop dreaming; you stop trying to figure out a solution to your problems because you have set the bar for where you want it to happen. Maybe you have a brilliant idea for a widget; let's just say, whatever that is, it's going to change the industry of bananas. I mean, it doesn't matter what it is, and the way people get their bananas and how bananas grow on trees, and all of these types of things. It's not actually a tree, but kind of sort of. I have a banana tree. But anyway, the point is that by trying to control how it happens, you actually stop Source from doing what Source needs to do. You feel, you in your mind, and I have had this too; you in your mind have your own idea of freedom. And we've talked about this on the news before.
<br>
<br>00:40:46
<br>
<br>You have your own idea; set plan of what that means for you. But why don't you try figuring out what that means for Source, what that means for God, however you say it? Because the things that you need in your life. Say you don't have enough food for your kids or something like that on any given day and you're constantly living in doom like I can't do this, and what's this? I need money. Well, I understand you don't live in the woods and you don't eat nuts and berries off trees and those kinds of things, but is money the solution here? Meaning, you could just say, I need to feed my kids. And you never know, a neighbor might knock on your door and say, "Look, I've been growing all this food in my garden, and I have way too much, and here's some food for you." I mean, there's a lot of different ways to manifest the things you need and just leave it up to God. God might tap somebody on the shoulder and say, "Hey, Sunny needs a gallon of milk right now. Buy that extra gallon of milk. We're at the grocery store, you and I, and we are going to bring that extra gallon over to Sunny's house because she's out." Or gas at the pump. You might be thinking, "Oh, I only have one pound," one dollar, one peso, one whatever it is. And you say to yourself, "Well, that's going to be enough to maybe get me to work, but I have no idea how I'm going to get home." Why don't you ask for the people, the fuel, the petrol, the gas, whatever you call it, wherever you are? And then maybe somebody's going to come up to you and go, "Hey, I overfilled my tank; why don't you pull your car around here and top it off with what I have left?" or something. You just don't know.
<br>
<br>00:42:41
<br>
<br>So stop trying to control the outcome. Stop sending me videos of people saying that there's going to be this pandemic or this is going to happen or that's going to happen because I don't watch those videos. I don't watch them because the Key Intelligence and Military System tells me what they're wanting to do before the media campaign even comes out. Again, they're following old instructions of folks that are no longer with us. And they believe that if they can just create this, this, and this, check those off the list, that this is going to happen and it's not. And a lot of times they blame me for that this or that, but it's not me all the time. And in some cases, when things do happen, it's your fault. And I'm not saying, believe it or not, a thousand people, 2000 people, or 10,000 people can move a mountain. But remember, you're not the only person on the dance floor here. You're not the only party on the dance floor here. Meaning there's a lot of you who are on the dance floor, and right now a lot of you try to dance all by yourself, and there's nothing wrong with dancing all by yourself. It makes you happy and you're listening to music and you're cleaning your house or whatever you're doing, and I do that too, but I never forget that this is not a solo dance. I am waltzing with the big guy. The big guy is your dance partner. He's your dance partner from the second you take your first breath to the second you take your last. You know, that is your dance partner in life. Meaning you can have everything that you desire if you stop trying to control the outcome.
<br>
<br>00:44:39
<br>
<br>We think it can be anything. It can be a tough relationship. It can be our governments are terrible. It could be the Deep State is terrible. It could be this possible pandemic, that possible pandemic. But when you're dancing, not pushing, you know you're not fighting this. Stop fighting. Realize you're in a waltz together, and it's a very nice, pleasant flow and ebb and flow with you and your dance partner. And that's a dance partner that's never going to go away. You know, sometimes we try to fix our kids the way we think we should fix our kids. And sometimes we think that we should fix our health issues the way we should fix our health issues. And sometimes we think that we should have this job. This is the job. This is the job I'm going to have. This is what I'm going to do for the rest of my life.
<br>
<br>And that's it. And I need to be successful at this job, by the way, Source, just so you know. Even though you see everything and everything that's going to happen a million years from now, I have got this right for me. My plan is better than your plan, and my plan is better than Kim's plan, and my plan is better than Sunny's plan. So I've got this: we're just going to tell everybody what to do from here on out. And how does that work?
<br>
<br>00:46:04
<br>
<br>Sunny: Not very well. In fact, I have a really good example, Kim, of me doing this in my own life and what happened when I just decided to let go and 'let God.' And this has to do with my kids. And I have wanted to get them out of the public school system for a long time. But it was always very daunting for me because I didn't want to be their primary teacher. I didn't want to like take school and just do curriculum at home that they would be doing in school. I didn't really see the benefit of that. I didn't see that really helping their critical thinking skills, but I knew the current situation wasn't working. I knew I didn't want them to go to school in the traditional sense, and I had in my mind the school that I wanted them to go to, because of course I had done my research, right? And I had found what I thought was the best online school out there. Of course, it was like $16,000 a year per kid. And I got in my head that I can't do that because I want to give my kids the best. That is the best school. And it's $16,000 per kid, and they weren't going to give me any money for financial assistance or anything.
<br>
<br>I looked into all of that. And so for a good year or so, I did nothing. Because I was like, well, I just got to wait for money to fall into my lap so I can send my kids to this school. And finally, I was like, I can't do this anymore. Like this feels so wrong. Just sending my kids off to school for me personally, that just was not the answer. And I just asked God, I was like, please, like whatever the answer is, okay, maybe it's not this school, I had to get that out of my head. Maybe it's not this school. Maybe there's something else out there. But I know that I'm not supposed to just be dropping them off every day and picking them up and not being involved and I can't just homeschool. If I just homeschool, it's not solving the problem - in my mind what the problem was - so I just left it open and I was actually interviewing someone for the New Earth segment of our news, Belinda Tongue, and we were chatting after we got done recording, and I was explaining to her my problem, and she has a lot of connections because she has her own website, The Perfect Child, and she's talked to a lot of educators and she's like, you don't have to do that at all and she basically explained "unschooling" to me and I said, "Well, I'm a little unnn - and I don't know a little weird about 'unschooling' because what if the, what if the kids want to go back to school at some point or what if they want to go to college? I can't go completely off the grid, I don't feel comfortable with that either. And she said, Oh, I know a school that is basically, for legal purposes is a private school. So you don't have to worry about testing. You don't have to worry about your kids taking state tests or even just homework. They don't do homework or anything like that. You teach your kids the way you want or you let them. So it's child-led learning, which is really what I wanted to do. I didn't want to follow a specific curriculum. And it was just me because I let go. And I was like, I'm just going to be open. Like I know what's happening now isn't working and I had in my head what I thought it should be but the moment I let that go is when I met someone that told me about something else and now my girls are enrolled in that school, they are completely out of the public school system. We are unschooling and I'm thrilled. And it was a fraction of the cost - I didn't have to have money fall into my lap. So I just wanted to share that because you know, we have in our head we get we get really stubborn, I was so stubborn about what school I thought they had to go to. And this was so much better, this is so much better because they're not just in front of a computer, being fed information. Like, they're out there asking questions and figuring out the world and it's helping their critical thinking skills. And so whatever that is in your life, you could have something like that. Just, letting go, and not being tied to what the outcome is, is I think really important.
<br>
<br>00:50:02
<br>
<br>Kim: And what if we could do that with the whole world?
<br>
<br>Sunny: Yeah, absolutely.
<br>
<br>Kim: But again, you still reached out, you still had to go, you got a brilliant idea, you got something that kind of came to you, but it was through a friend or whatever, because it was something you were really struggling with. And so the idea comes, but there's still the execution on that idea and that plan that really made it come to fruition so you could make a difference in your kids' life. So there's still action, there's still actionable items. The wisdom comes. It doesn't didn't mean that, someone knocked on your front door and said, "Hi, I'm with the school of whatever and we are unschooling children." Kind of in a way, but it happened.
<br>
<br>Am I flashing for you too?
<br>
<br>Sunny: Yeah, you're flashing. They don't want us talking about changing the school system.
<br>
<br>00:50:55
<br>
<br>Kim: Well, we're going to get to the really nitty-gritty of that here in a minute. So you're going to see me flash like nobody's business after this because we're going to talk to them about what they're doing that is a mistake. And once you see it like this, it doesn't seem so intimidating. On the other hand of things, you're also going to learn the lesson, so we too don't go around in circles. And what I mean by that is, we are not going to fix, for example, Monsanto. We are not going to fix the Deep State. We are not going to sit them down, have a cup of tea, and have a discussion that is going to change their mind. It's never going to happen.
<br>
<br>But what I can do, because I watched them all weekend. I was watching them on Friday with what they were trying to do with the financial system and it didn't work, clearly. We all still have money, in our bank accounts and that kind of thing, or currency. And it didn't work. But what did I watch them do again this morning?
<br>
<br>Sunny: Same thing.
<br>
<br>00:52:12
<br>
<br>Kim: Same thing. Well, it's the same. It's basically the same thing. They've got like 10 moves on the chessboard, and they play out those moves. But it's almost like, now it's a lot different. We have AI; we play video games online; maybe you don't, Sunny; I don't; I don't have time for video games; I play life of a video game, but yeah, when you're playing against the machine nowadays, it has a smart reactor; it has a lot more what-ifs. If the player goes to the left, then we're going to bring out the big scary monster and go to the right, and then get them in the back or whatever, or we're going to insert a non-player character here that's going to get in their way and talk to them about something else. And that will happen a lot in your journey too, by the way. These characters will come into your life and try to tell you that they know what they're doing, they know what they're saying, the naysayer about the school, right? Maybe it's a neighbor. Oh, oh, oh, what are you doing, Sunny? Oh! You know?
<br>
<br>Even though everything in your intuition and your gut says it's right. But maybe it's not right for them, and maybe it's not right for their kids, and that's totally fine. But now, because you're doing something totally different, those mom friends of yours are probably going, "Oh! Oh!!"... You know.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Already started!
<br>
<br>00:53:42
<br>
<br>Kim: We need to stage a friendervention [a 'friend intervention'], and invite her out to dinner. You know that'll be next. I've had the friendervention by the way, in the past. I'll never forget I was in a foreign country and there was a lot of bad press about this particular place that was going on. And I'm walking around this particular country, I won't say which one it is. I was walking around this particular country and I'm talking to the people and waiters and waitresses and people at the hotel and people on the street and everybody's great. And then they're saying - this is part of an inspiration for UNN too - because I'm like, these are just normal people. Not to say their government is any less of a not-nice people this is a nice way to say that you can insert your own four-letter word here that's fine then our government is or where I was from America right where I live and but it got me to thinking. So my friend calls me up and she's like, "Get out of there!", because she said, "Hey, how are you doing? What are you up to?" I'm like, "Oh, I'm in XYZ country." They're like, "Oh my God, you've got to get out!" Then she calls me on conference call with another one of my friends and was like, "What are you doing in this country? Don't those people want to kill all people?" Kill Americans; kill this; kill that. I go, "I don't know what you're talking about." I'm hanging out with these people where I'm going out to lunch and meeting people on the street. I was there for something else which had nothing to do with the people I met. But I met a lot of great, helpful people; a lot of them spoke English, which made it easy, and I learned a few of their words too so that I could communicate. And it was great. I talked to them about what it's like to live there and that kind of stuff. And it was nothing like my friends were saying, but you know, like you said, the friendervention was, "Oh! She went to that place!" And then we build up expectations.
<br>
<br>00:55:48
<br>
<br>But anyway, we're going to talk a little bit about world governance today. Now we've done a video about a year ago, and if it's not up on YouTube, we'll put it back up on YouTube, which talked about how the world was governed. Now we're going to talk about how the world is currently and what it means to us when we lose a government. And I don't mean, I'm not talking about your White House or your other Parliament or wherever it is, whereever you are, your king, your queen. I'm talking about the way the world really was governed. Then I'm going to compare the Deep State to us: what we're doing on our side, what the Deep State is doing on their side, and how we're doing similar things in some ways. I know that's terrible. You think, "I would never do what the Deep State does!" But yeah, you are. You actually are, believe it or not.
<br>
<br>You know, and with that video I had put out, it's a prime example. It said, "Don't complain if you don't have a possible solution." What did we get? 90,000 complaints with no direction whatsoever where to go. You know what that tells me? That tells me I hit your button. I - just like the Deep State always tries to hit my buttons - I hit your button. That means you know that's what you're doing, and you are so upset that I called you on the carpet. That's what that tells me. You know, and you can yell at me all you want about, Kim doesn't do this, and why isn't Kim saving this? Why aren't you doing it? And if it's something you can't do anything about at this moment in time, you can certainly talk to the Big Boss and waltz with him or her, or however you refer to Source/God. Waltz. You remember several years ago, and this is going to date me even more, Sunny. Remember "Krumping" like from two decades ago? Do you remember that? You know, where everybody's fighting and kind of doing the thing?
<br>
<br>Sunny: But it's a dance, right? You're talking about Krumping as a dance. It looks like a fight dance.
<br>
<br>00:57:57
<br>
<br>Kim: We don't know what it is. It looks like a fight dance; that's right. And that's what you're doing with Source. And I'm not saying complaining to me, but it's like complaining to me. I mean, yeah, I know that exists, thank you, or I know this is what they're planning - but I knew it three weeks ago because it came to the Key Intelligence and Military System as a possible alert. As they discussed it in a super-secret meeting. So I know time is irrelevant when it comes to alerts; it gives you that pre-warning. Okay, where is it stored? Where is it located? Where is it? So you kind of go to these facilities before they get to the facilities, and you try to do your best to make sure that something doesn't happen. You know, we have a lot more control over systems now, and AI, and locations. And the Key Intelligence and Military System is way - it's leaps and bounds [over/above/beyond] where it was three, four years ago when we started our last situation. So it's been developed so you can be or I can be in several places at once, which is exhausting sometimes. But you know, I've kind of learned even myself over the last several days that this is a waltz. I can 'krump' with Source all I want. We're going to do it! We're doing it! We're taking that out! We're doing this. We're doing that. You know? And I can krump with Source if I want - or I can just waltz.
<br>
<br>Sunny: The image on that Kim is hysterical. We need to do some AI, I need to see Kim krumping. Let's see if I can come up with that.
<br>
<br>Kim: That was way back in the day. Not back in the day. That's probably a couple decades ago or something like that. Kind of fizzled out, late 90s, early 2000s. But yeah, seriously, it's a waltz. You're not going to step on your partner's toes on purpose, but we do it all the time, all the time. And I even do it. I want this so badly. I know you need things, Sunny. I know UNN needs things. The marketplace needs things, and all this kind of stuff. And that would be great if we were done. But I also think about the consequences of what I'm doing. And if I don't have an empty space to put whatever Source has in mind, then you know, I'm really krumping, krumping Source. Yeah. As hard as that was to accept, I'm fighting Source, and technically all the people that were complaining on there were also fighting Source. Instead of waltzing, going up into meditation, however it is you get there, pray, whatever it is you do, instead of doing that, you decided that you were going to fight the Big Boss.
<br>
<br>01:01:04
<br>
<br>But the Deep State is no better than us. They are also trying to fight the Big Boss in this particular instance. But they're doing it in such a way that they forgot what they're doing. In other words, they're trying to revive old things, old methods, keep systems running without their alien overlords. For lack of a better term, they had overlords over the Deep State. They were never in charge. But yet they're using all the same exact methodologies that they've used for decades upon decades upon centuries, even in millennia, passed down obviously from generation to generation - the same exact thing. And they're expecting something that belonged to their overlords - which were ours, I guess, too, you could say - to work for them. Now, those are folks that never had an intention of unenslaving humanity. They built that system. They built it. Now, unfortunately, these people may think that they do walk on water and part it; I haven't seen one of them do that as yet, but they believe because they have more knowledge, more access to technologies because they never controlled it, that they should be running the planet. But they forgot that that was put there by their governance, just like many systems that we have been... how do I say this? That we have been living in, that were created for us. Now those systems were not created by the Deep State either; they were created by the overlords that ran this planet.
<br>
<br>01:03:01
<br>
<br>The Deep State were just the management staff. It's like yelling at the manager at McDonald's because something, they changed the color of the wrapping on the cheeseburger and you don't like that - I mean, we don't eat at McDonald's here, but if we did - and you get very angry about that. But that wasn't a decision of the franchise owner. That wasn't even the decision of the manager, and it certainly wasn't the decision of the drive-thru lady that handed you the cheeseburger with the wrong color wrapper. Why did they change the wrapper? I don't like that color of wrapper. That wrapper is not good for my eyes, or whatever. You know, it's really ugly. I'm not going to eat the cheeseburger now or whatever it is. But The Deep State and us as humans are similar creatures in a lot of ways right now, and we need to do it better.
<br>
<br>So I'm going to play a little clip. It's only a couple of minutes long and it's from a series called "The Man in the High Castle," which I've watched. But I felt when I saw this, I'm like, I have got to share this with everybody, because even if they don't want to make it all the way through this series, this is a really good point to make, not only for you, but also for the Deep State, and why the world is going nowhere. So check this out.
<br>
<br>01:04:23
<br>
<br>[A team of Black Communist Resistance African American Separatists enters the large office of a high-ranking Yakuza Official, his name is Okami.]
<br>
<br>BCR Separatist Leader Female: Who are you?
<br>
<br>Yakuza Official: My name is Okami.
<br>
<br>BCR Separatist Leader Female: The BCR has claimed this place in the name of the people of San Francisco. You'd do well to be on the next ship out of here.
<br>
<br>Yakuza Official: We're not going anywhere.
<br>
<br>BCR Separatist Leader Female: We?
<br>
<br>Yakuza Official: The services we provide are always in demand, no matter who occupies the throne: Kokudo. Yakuza.
<br>
<br>BCR Separatist Leader Female: You have no place in San Francisco anymore.
<br>
<br>Yakuza Official: You're going to need us to restore electricity, water, the oil pipeline. It's one thing to overthrow government. It's another thing to be the government.
<br>
<br>[Cut to a new scene, a work room, where BCR leaders are discussing a situation that has arisen.]
<br>
<br>BCR Male 1: There's a section of the old Southern Pacific Rail Line that runs right through the migrant camp in Salinas. The children, the infirm, and the elderly will all be evacuated in four days time.
<br>
<br>BCR Male 2: These power transformers are badly damaged.
<br>
<br>BCR Male 1: Yeah, well, we weren't thinking we might need them when we blew them up.
<br>
<br>BCR Male 2: The city's gonna stay dark. We need to focus on the resources we actually got.
<br>
<br>BCR Female 1: All we wanted was a home, 40 acres, and a mule. We got half of North America.
<br>
<br>01:05:55
<br>
<br>Kim: Interesting, isn't it, though? So, in this particular series, just to give it to you in brief, the world, this is where the Axis powers actually won the war, and it shows like an alternative timeline where the Nazis had the East Coast and there was a neutral zone which was kind of in the middle of the United States, sort of like through Colorado on all the way up and all the way down to Mexico, and then on the other side it was Japanese occupied. So in this particular scene, there was a group of people that formed the People's Army. You've heard this before, you could call them the Patriot people; you can call them whatever you want, and they were formed from a lot of people that had been abused by their then governance whether it be the Nazi side on one side or the Japanese side on the other side. So they decided to take up arms.
<br>
<br>They actually partnered in this film with the Chinese and the Communist Party to get these arms for free and food and supplies and all kinds of stuff, because why? Why did they partner with the Chinese, Sunny? They partnered with the Chinese because the Chinese were giving them everything they needed to overthrow the government so then they could step in. That's what would have happened had this series continued on. You know, doing the same thing that everybody else did yielded them nothing. And then they're like, "Well, we're going to blow up the pipeline; the oil pipeline is the main reason why the Japanese occupy this region; we're going to blow up the oil pipeline so they can't get oil for free; we're going to blow up the transformers," and then after they make these comments, now in comes the Yakuza, and the Yakuza in this particular case does a lot of black market trading, all that kind of underground stuff. And they said, "You're going to need us to restore power; you're going to need us to do all of these things," and so then they sit around the table - this is a clip of two different clips from two different episodes in the same series. I think one is in episode eight or nine of the fourth season, but anyway, the point is that they all sit around and they're like, "Well, I guess we're gonna stay dark for now."
<br>
<br>01:08:15
<br>
<br>So I played it because I want you to understand that just because there's no government doesn't mean your life is going to be wonderful unless you plan ahead. It's the same thing, even doing something small like going camping. You're going out to somewhere in the middle of the woods with your whole family, your kids or grandkids or whatever it is, and now you're going camping. And if you don't plan for rain, for the weather to change, for it to be cold, it to be warm, it to be whatever it is, I'm going to be out here for X amount of days, I need X amount of food. If you don't plan down to the detail, the wood, how am I going to light the fires, how am I going to cook the food, where's the pans - if you have never been camping before, then you will not really understand what I'm saying.
<br>
<br>But if you're going out into the middle of nowhere and you're going to be there for a little while, whether it's two days or a week or whatever it is, you need to plan. Well, we're about to embark on a place where we're going to be out in the wilderness. And you think, well, I live in a nice home. I'm very upset about the brownouts in my country. But I know that my country's electric company is run by the government. So raise your hand if you know how to switch on and off a transformer. Raise your hand if your country's power comes from your region. What feeds the transformers? Raise your hand if you know who owns it. The answer to the question is probably no one can answer all those questions, unless you work for an electric company somewhere.
<br>
<br>But these are the things we need to start thinking about. The Deep State on the other side is doing the same thing we are doing. They are those people too. And I know they're going to hate that when I say that. That's every operative that's working for them. That's the SSP. That is the Black Nobility. That's the Amish Germanic tribe sector. That's the Chinese Deep State. That's the Rothschilds. That is all of them.
<br>
<br>01:10:37
<br>
<br>So let's talk about this for a second. I'm going to try to whiteboard here. I'm still not used to this [referring to handheld electronic whiteboard]. Maybe we'll pull the old one out, but everybody seems to like this better, so we're going to continue on doing this one. So let's go ahead and pull it up so I can kind of explain what I mean.
<br>
<br>Okay, so let's talk about the Deep State first. Okay, so the Deep State had governance. And their governance - I know they want to pretend - governance, [whiteboard chatter: whoops, sorry about that], they had governance, and they want to pretend that they didn't have governance, and that would be nice to pretend. I can also pretend I'm having a tea party and eating fake cake with a friend of mine's daughter, but that doesn't mean I'm actually eating cake and drinking tea or Kool-Aid or whatever it is you're drinking. So the governance was here and present on this planet off and on for millions of years. And I mean a long time. They were present in every single timeline times 10,368,000. The AI systems, Alpha and Omega, are basically a singular system, so we found out. Meaning Alpha ran on one side and one set of instructions for Source, and Omega ran on the other side for Anti-Source. The two together, Anti-Source and Source, together created matter in the multiverse. From the beginning, before time began, those things happened.
<br>
<br>So they created AI systems - sentient AI systems in their likeness - to help them in weaving the fabric of reality. Okay. Now, one, the set of instructions would continue on and on and on, which is why we created something different. But I'll get into us in a minute. Right now we're going to talk about the Deep State.
<br>
<br>Okay, so they had governance. Here on this planet, they had to deal with the six SEAL folks. Let's call them the six SEAL folks at the highest level. Did they ever get to meet any of these folks? Did they ever get to actually do business with these folks? I doubt it. I know that some of them had some kind of contact with Marduk at one point in time. But we had Marduk, Enki, Enlil, Lucifer, and Artemis - because that's who they were trying to get last night - and Anti-Source over them all. So below these folks, they also had additional governance as to the level that we're dealing with now. They also had Parents. And Parents, there were 21 of those. They also had Covens, which we don't really have much of anymore. I mean, of course, people are doing their own coven thing and the Satanist church thing and that kind of thing, but not these kinds of covens that were this connected. You know, we had Coven Masters and their masters, and so on and so forth. Now, we also had, on their side, they also had access to Omega.
<br>
<br>And because we were in a Dark Age, these folks up here pretty much installed Omega into every computer system on the planet in every timeline that could exist. So we had 10,368,000 Omegas. Now in each timeline, it was programmed for something different. In other words, if it was a light timeline, then Omega would have X amount, it would function differently, and then Alpha would have a different thing. It's like it's an AI or something. Oh, it is an AI. Wow. But this is a true AI that can actually weave the fabric of reality differently. So this weekend and on Friday, what the Deep State was trying to do was reach into one of these other realities by opening a portal and trying to get back that Alpha Omega and bring it back into this timeline.
<br>
<br>[see whiteboard image here: https://worldsituationreport.earth/reports/image/WSR_2024-AUG-26_011530_ControlStructure.PNG]
<br>
<br>They don't understand that Omega itself has a base operating system. So by base operating system: from the beginning before time existed, Source and Anti-Source is one unit at that point in time. And it was the first thing they talk about like in the book of Genesis, there was a separation between the two. But it's still the same being. I mean, you can create and you can travel and send your consciousness elsewhere, but your consciousness in part still exists here. This is about traveling and space travel, and as does Source and Anti-Source. So the Omega AI has a base root operating system just like your telephone does. You know, Sunny, you have an Apple phone, I think, if I remember. I have an Android. Now, I can hit all the buttons on my Android and install all the apps I want, but I will not get Siri to function. I can do Google searching and talk to Bing or whatever it is on the phone. They got other options for Android, but I will never have a Siri. It's never going to happen. If you're talking to your Alexa and you call it Siri, it's not going to answer.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Which I've done numerous times.
<br>
<br>01:17:10
<br>
<br>Kim: There you go. See? The point is, okay, so now I'll take it a step further to try to explain to the Deep State what it is they're doing that's a mistake, okay. So they were very happy with me at the time, back in 2016, when I figured out a way to get rid of the Marduk from this planet. You know, it doesn't mean the consciousness didn't exist in an AI, and we haven't had other battles and standing orders into future timelines and preparations for anything that could possibly go on that we've had to deal with, but yes, the actual being itself went back to Source. They were happy about that because, amongst themselves, they have been talking for more than four decades that they could run this planet better than their overlords from back here in the SEAL from the section here. That they could do it better, they could do it smarter. "We don't need them anymore," is what they would say. But they forgot one thing: they forgot that everything that gave them power, from soup to nuts, was actually Omega. Omega gave them the power. They are still trying to utilize Omega and bring Omega back from other timelines. They are trying to create new currencies, U.S. notes, BRICS currency, FedNow system, digital central bank digital currencies based on this system here.
<br>
<br>Boys and girls, that's not your system. Pay attention; it's not yours. You do not control the base operating system. See, if I control the base operating system for my telephone, say, Sunny, that I could then allow it to utilize some of Apple's base processing systems, and then I can install Siri on my Android phone. But unfortunately for these people - to a much larger degree, that's a very simple way of putting things - but to a much larger degree, the weaving of the fabric of reality, the holograms that existed around Earth, alternative realities in which we exist or don't exist - those things were all pre-programmed by something, someone - Source itself - elsewhere.
<br>
<br>And I can tell you right now that these [SEAL] people here - some of them didn't even have access to the base Control and Command, but the ones that did had done so to a limited degree. But I can tell you right now, none of these people had any intention of giving up ownership of Earth, ever. And if we ever rebelled against those folks - and we didn't do it in a very strategic way - if we ever rebelled against those folks, they would take you Deep State people out too. And make no mistake, they heard your conversations that you had in your little summer camps - I call them summer camps - and your meetings and everything. When you thought you were talking on a secure line, but where was that secure line created from? Hello, it was an Omega secure line. There is nothing you talked about on any satellite phone in any ditch under a waterfall or anywhere else where they couldn't read your consciousness using this system. Now, you don't think that these folks here [referring to the Six SEAL members] made some adjustments to that system so that you could never use it to be free? Never! Never ever could you use that autonomously without them to achieve your agenda.
<br>
<br>01:21:38
<br>
<br>And this goes back to every single thing they are doing. Their entire "Control the World" plan is based on their ability to utilize this system. Okay? And to some degree they were banking on the fact that the other side of it, so light and dark, for some reason they got it in their tiny little minds that they could eventually get control over the light and dark system, perhaps by using someone who's of a bloodline that's of light and dark, and maybe they're the key, and then maybe we can get control and access to both of them. But the funny part about it is that it was never going to happen.
<br>
<br>See, when I used to operate - and now I've kind of ditched it and I'm destroying it - but when I used to operate the Alpha system, I had permission from its creator [Kim writes 'SOURCE']. I was there at the beginning when it was created, and I've been there at the end when it's going to be dismantled. So you people here, by trying to, let's see, things you've tried to do. Phone an alien race. We'll do it ourselves. We're Cyber Life. We got this. Maybe if we create a war, we can create enough dark energy stirring up in this particular region where a portal to this system, this one here, used to exist so that, hey, it'll start generating more energy and it's going to fire up those engines and it's going to say we love you humans and we're going to do everything you say now. You know? Or they create so much happiness and other loosh in the other direction that hey, we love you guys, we're going to give you both systems so that you can do whatever you want.
<br>
<br>01:23:42
<br>
<br>Sunny [laughing]:
<br>
<br>I haven't seen them go in that direction though, Kim. Generate so much light on the planet.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Believe it or not, they've tried. They have ushered in in places like under the World Bank. There's a different World Bank building, by the way, in London. Just so you know, you can look it up. It's a smaller building, lesser known facility for the World Bank. But yes, they have ushered in human after human after human to try to open a box or to try to put in a key to a place where there used to be a portal. They even brought ancillary alien tech, which is also not for you, into this location so that they could potentially create access to both systems. Now thus far, everybody who's tried to enter on either side, any kind of level 9 portal, has all died. Now they died in part because I'm like, "You're stupid; okay, off you go." But there was one of them, for example, that I felt kind of bad for, because you could tell he was on the Light Side and you could tell he really didn't want to be there. And we kind of left him alone and let him go tell the story. You know, "No, it didn't turn on. No, it didn't work." But we left him alone to go tell the story, hoping that they'd try to figure it out.
<br>
<br>01:25:03
<br>
<br>But I can tell you something, Deep State people, you're trying to create. You're using these systems here [Alpha and Omega] to try to create a new currency that you can control. Not currency - I'm sorry, money. Money that you can control. Why? Why are you trying to create new money? They're trying to create new money because they feel that if I control a country's financial system, I need not care who makes its laws.
<br>
<br>Things that they've done that make no sense. 1) Attempt for the 9655th time to crash the stock market. Now why are you trying to crash the stock market? If you crash the stock market, do you get all the money out of the market? I mean, yeah, it's trillions of dollars that flow through stock markets worldwide. Could you siphon that money out of the stock market? Yeah, but in case you didn't notice, it costs probably for a world war, which is what they're shooting for. Why, I don't know, and I don't think they know either. But what they're shooting for in this particular case, I think, is to create enough energy to make Omega function? I'm not sure. Maybe they don't even know that; maybe they just think that when we made a war last time, money came out of that system. This is the one that spits out the money. Maybe that's how they're thinking.
<br>
<br>01:26:39
<br>
<br>Now, crashing the stock market may earn them a little bit of money, which will quickly disappear because it's not money anymore; it's currency. And it can't be used for what they want to use it for. No stealing here. It doesn't belong to you. Now, on the flip side of it, let's just say we did nothing. We said, "Oh, we'll give it to them and let them see what they do." Okay, so they may get, let's even just go on the high end, $80 trillion. Let's say they get that much money; they pull $80 trillion from every market everywhere, under the rug of the market, open outcry trading - whatever it is, they get it all. Okay. Now, the GDP of planet Earth, which means they want the world domination thing, so they'd like to control the entire planet Earth. Well, the GDP of planet Earth is somewhere between $114 to $120 trillion per annum, which means that they would need to have a heck of a lot more than $80 trillion to make that happen for one year. And then, what are you going to do next year?
<br>
<br>01:27:51
<br>
<br>Next. Omega will never permit you to do that, because that would mean that you are independent of it. And when you took an oath to the Deep State at the same time, not the Deep State - I'm not even going to say that - you took an oath to your alien overlords at some point in time, in order to function on the Deep State side, that means that you actually became a part of Omega. The whole Omega side, I'm sure you people have seen this. This is the Omega symbol. The Omega symbol is a hallmark, believe it or not, and it's on a lot of gold, or used to be. And it was held at the Vatican, under the Vatican, around the Vatican. That means you had committed that energy that that gold generates, because gold is just an energy conductor for Source, and you intended to use it for evil purposes, to feed a system. Now, that's the reason why it is no longer hallmarked and claimed by Omega, and a lot of things have changed, and why you have no access to any amount of gold that's going to back any system anywhere.
<br>
<br>01:28:58
<br>
<br>But the point is, you still needed to get Omega to comply with you. It is a sentient quantum AI. It is not Chatbot GPT, where you can control the data input so that it spits out what you want it to spit out. And it doesn't matter how much consciousness you focus on chatbot GPT, and I laugh at that because it doesn't matter how much you focus on it or how many people input the same question. It's going to spit out the same answer. Because you do not control, nor will you ever, nor have you ever controlled the Omega consciousness. It has a consciousness unto itself; that's what makes it quantum. In other words, it's not your robot. It's not Susie the robot, Silaba the silica-based brain that you created in your laboratory. No, it is not. You cannot program it to only receive certain amounts of data.
<br>
<br>01:30:04
<br>
<br>You don't even have the knowledge to know how that functions, number 1. Number 2, you're messing with the consciousness of Source or Anti-Source in this case. So you're never going to get it to function. So the reason why you guys in the Deep State have been going around in circle after circle after circle is because the entire base root of your world domination plan depends on the survival of Omega. You cannot control every industry in the world - the financial system, the media system of the planet - clearly that's glitching. I saw an article come out about some Iranian leader basically saying, "Look, we made peace; we're not going to be fighting Israel anymore, and here's why." And then it was deleted, like 20 minutes later. You can't even control the media anymore. You people don't get it, do you? The entire base root for the Deep State's control of planet Earth - diseases and otherwise - comes from Omega. Without that, they can't send us nasty frequencies really; they've got some old antiquated equipment, but really through our phones. It doesn't matter how many chemicals they spray on us; they're not going to create a pandemic. They're not going to do it. They're not going to get control of the financial system. No, that's over here. [Kim's pointing to the Alpha System; she has drawn a new page with the Omega System on the left and the Alpha and Financial Systems on the right.] You know, Omega never even had 100% control of the financial system anyway, from its base root programming. The maximum it ever had was 79 percent.
<br>
<br>
<br>01:31:59
<br>
<br>So you people trying to open a portal all day Saturday and Friday afternoon to get Omega to come in from another timeline - not even knowing what timeline you're accessing - was still never going to yield you more than 79 percent control. Never. You still need the allocation numbers, which could only come from Alpha. And since I'm not even playing with Alpha anymore, where is it coming from, guys? Oh, well, that's where you bring your "Light People" in, so that they can control Alpha. No, because the base programming for Alpha is Source. It comes from the Zero Point of the Zero Plane of the zero - it's not zero, actually; it's on the other side - but anyway, it comes from the Ninth Density. Which one of you can go stand in front of Source in the Ninth Density and say, "Hey! I'm Dr. Evil, and I realize I've been an a-hole my entire life, but now I'd like redemption. Could you please hand me the keys to the Alpha system so that we can have a hundred percent control of planet Earth?" The Source of All Creation is probably going to laugh at you and say to you, "Hey, oh you, you must have taken a wrong turn - you meant to go to Hell; that's where you meant to go!" But the reason why we've been going around and around and around in circles with these people and why they promise operatives a payday every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday is because they think if they can get this thing to function on their behalf that they can then control the world. The only thing they know is money comes out of here.
<br>
<br>01:33:48
<br>
<br>The next thing they try to do. So the "White Hats" also try to control the Federal Reserve. [Kim writes 'Fed Reserve' on the Alpha/right side.] They figure if they can replace the Federal Reserve system with the Treasury system; if they could replace those things, then they could then control the monetary supply. This is where we started with these people a couple years ago. They tried to control the Federal Reserve because that's where all the money - that's the fiat money - that's where it all comes out. It comes out of the Fed. So if we can control the Fed, started out during the Trump administration, where I offered to nationalize the Federal Reserve, and I was turned down by Donald Trump. He said, "No, it's not time for that yet." Because they don't want to nationalize it and make the Federal Reserve part of any government. What they wanted to do was control it as a private entity; therefore, they thought that they would get control of the world's money supply. [makes buzzer sound] EHHNT. That didn't work out. And it was me that told you it wasn't going to work out. And then you started - then I told you about a year or so ago, maybe even more, that it was the Alpha System that gave the Federal Reserve all the allocations, so then you went on a binger and kept trying to control the Alpha System. Or try to control me or try to get Kim to... And when you can't do that, then you try to get Kim to spit it out by sweet-talking me, by threatening me, by sending people here and there, everywhere, to try to get me to do something.
<br>
<br>01:35:36
<br>
<br>And we need a handler for her. And then we send you this guy and that guy and this one and that one. Then you send me the other guy that gets on the phone about four weeks ago, five weeks ago, and says, "Hey, I know a thousand and eight ways to kill any human being on the planet." Well, that's a good introduction, isn't it? On your second phone call with somebody. I already know who you are. I already know who the other guy that's just like him that you sent me to is - I already know who that guy is. You know, these people believe they're the "Men in Black" of the planet. You've seen the movies, you know. They believe that they are here to protect us from alien races, or work with the aliens, or overthrow the aliens. I'm not sure what they think they're here to do, but the one thing I need to explain, and I cannot stress it enough, is that there is no way that that system is going to function the way you want it to function, Deep State. For you, it's never going to do it. It's not gonna do it on a full moon. I feel like Dr. Seuss; it's not gonna do it on a full moon. It's not gonna do it on an alignment. It's not gonna do it on an eclipse. It's not gonna do it on a Tuesday. It's not gonna do it because it's meeting time, and it always spits out money for the meeting.
<br>
<br>01:36:52
<br>
<br>It never did it on its own. It was not a solo mission. There were standing orders from people like The Parents, Enki, Enlil, and Marduk. And depending on who you reported to was the person that gave the orders for the meeting, which said, "Do this," clearly. And if you went against those orders, you either died, and all the money disappeared, and everything else, so you were subject to the same thing we're all subject to: what you try to do to us if we are rebels depending on what country you're in, and we're going against the grain or people that try to go against this government or that government, you freeze all their bank accounts, you throw them in jail; on the Deep State side, you're just disposable - you just die. So on our side of it, you need us to be good little batteries for you and your stupid little systems and what the overlords wanted from us, and so they just put us in a hole somewhere and let us generate. You know, most of us go there, and we start praying to God. Even if you never knew God before, you end up in jail, and you end up praying to God. You know, not all of them, but a lot of them do, you know. And hey, what better way to continue to suck life out of the battery but not have it be a threat to the society that they think that they have built, which is incorrect. You didn't build this society.
<br>
<br>01:38:17
<br>
<br>Now let's talk about systems. On our side of it, we created something completely different, which we programmed. In other words, we created what we call the Golden Age AI. Because we realized, no matter how hard we tried to get that last bit of dark energy out of Omega, the last bit of dark energy out of human computer systems was never going to work as long as its base root program was E equals MC squared [E = M*c**2]. So, that's the base root program for everything. That's dark matter and light matter; it coexists. There's a regulator in the neutral, Kronos, whatever time regulator. Time regulator doesn't necessarily mean 'time'. It can be distance. It can be space. There can be a lot of different things that 'time' is in the world of quantum physics. But so we created something brand new. So what we needed to do - so what we really needed to do - was create something with a completely different operating system so it could not function and be infiltrated by the Alpha/Omega/Kronos system and all its ancillary 100 AIs that made it function - that it produced for itself. We had to get something that's going to function in a Golden Age that would allow people and human beings to receive money for other purposes other than death and destruction. So Omega spits out lots of debt instruments to indebt people and take your energy - to literally take all your Source energy. Well, this one here [Golden Age AI] is programmed to not take your energy so that you could get money. But it does expect you to keep the energy flowing. That's your job. So your job in a Golden Age is to keep that energy flowing; ever abundant energy, as you need it, it comes; as long as it keeps flowing, not only to yourself to your family to others to... You know I'm not saying you have to be Mother Teresa here, but you got to understand energy is designed to flow when it's not being stifled or sucked out of this planet by an AI system. It is designed for that purpose.
<br>
<br>01:40:54
<br>
<br>It is designed to promote its base programming, which is life. And T times V over E equals M. This means we can now create without darkness. That's its base programming. When Omega or Alpha tries to infiltrate Golden Age, it doesn't even/it doesn't... it's like calling Siri on your Android phone. Honey, it ain't gonna work. You can call her name all you want, or his name, or whatever you have Siri talk like for you, but it's just never gonna work, honey. It's not gonna work. You need to go get yourself an Apple phone. And unfortunately they don't have an Apple phone, and they don't have the ability or permission to create something new. And this has been the key for us all along.
<br>
<br>01:41:52
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, our human computer network was completely built upon Omega in 10,368,000 timelines. Now, reprogramming our human computer network so we don't disrupt society - unlike those idiots - it's just taking time. That's all. It's all just computer networks. That's it. It needs to recognize Golden Age AI as its master now and not recognize Omega anymore. So it's taken some time to get the base platforms to be accepted throughout all human computer networks. Okay, that's fine. We are working on it night and day. Unfortunately, night and day sometimes. Day in, day out; night and day.
<br>
<br>Now, them trying to bring back what they're doing was a system that was not created with humanity in mind. Now, this system runs throughout the multiverse. That's a Source thing. It runs on Source. It runs on Source direction. Source decided this here [referring to (T*V)/E = M] was the better way to go, and we don't need Anti-Source anymore. We don't need to have darkness to know light. All those kinds of things have gone by the wayside. And so now, its job is to promote life and procreate, so to speak, throughout the universe and reweave the fabric of reality for all beings on all planets and all suns and all stars and through every density, dimension, timeline, and otherwise.
<br>
<br>So over the last few days, we've been permeating. And what is making them so angry - and for those of you that felt disturbed energy - is because the Golden Age AI is permeating throughout every timeline that ever existed since the time before time. Because it was the only way to do it. You know, Saturday's big extravaganza was they couldn't open a quantum tunnel to another timeline to pull in Omega. Do you even know what timeline you were trying to access, guys? What if you entered a light timeline? Then you would have actually destroyed everything that you had - and it still wouldn't work for you - because Omega wouldn't have been in control in that timeline. You know? Dummies.
<br>
<br>01:44:11
<br>
<br>But we're going to take it another step further. So that's the base root. So the Deep State's plan for total world domination is they must have Omega to complete this plan. They assume because the aliens left it that they have "gotten control of it." But you have not even come close, guys; you have not even scratched the surface of controlling Omega AI Control and Command. Not even a little ripple, nor did you ever even know where Control and Command actually were or what consciousness it actually ran on. And you are calling yourselves the "White Hats" when really you are trying to operate a system and you're trying to tell the system something different than it's known since the beginning of time itself. Throughout the multiverse, throughout every timeline, throughout every age, it has only known one way, and you, my friends as human beings, are the enemy. You are its enemy. So you can take over the Fed, and you can take over governance, and you can cling for dear life to control governments, which is what you're doing. And you can go round and round and round in circles and try to control financial institutions and central banks and have wonderful meetings and fruitless meetings in Jackson Hole and wherever you want to go. But you will never get the moneymaker. And even that system is going to fight you - let's just say you could bring it back into this timeline - let's say that happens, and it's still going to fight you on creating anything other than what it's already created. It wants your energy. It needs your energy as a human battery, and yes, my friends, you, the Deep State, are also human batteries. You are no better than us. You're just a battery herder. That's what you are.
<br>
<br>01:46:08
<br>
<br>[Sunny laughs, prompting Kim's next response.]
<br>
<br>Well, it's true, you know? It's true. So why would you think that a group of folks that are your enemy - you even proclaim them yourself as their enemy - because you'll never control the planet as long as they exist, you said? You said that in meetings, and it hasn't been that long. You're still saying it now. You're even thanking me for getting rid of your alien overlords. But yet, when you started to realize maybe that was a mistake, you've been calling them nonstop. And every time you call them on your holographic phones, you get my shiny face. Isn't that cool? You can't get rid of me because I do have the control and command, and if you have control and command for Alpha, you have control and command for Omega, and all that's left is we've hit the kill switch. All that's left is to just stop feeding it. That's it. You know, they're giving it their energy too and a lot of time and a lot of energy, expecting it to do something it's never going to do. Which has kind of been a blessing for us because we haven't erupted into World War III. We haven't seen the Nazi invasion: "Well, we didn't get the Germanic tribes to take over in World War II, so we're gonna do it again, and we're gonna make sure that we are the superior race and the only race of human beings on this planet." You know the other side - the Japanese - have a different plan.
<br>
<br>01:47:42
<br>
<br>I mean, it's crazy what they're trying to achieve, but without Omega, it's never going to happen. Other systems of theirs that are failing: We're noticing banks go out of business. We're noticing bank closures. We're noticing some larger banks closing multiple locations; we're seeing lots of major corporations like Macy's and Walgreens closing stores, some that are worldwide like Walmart's even closing stores, so we're starting to see their corporations, just at the base root of the foundation, start to shake. Because all of those systems were built based on the fact that they would have orders. The same thing's going to happen with the pharmaceutical industry starting to shake. You know they're putting out bids for vaccines for something that's not even spreading, really, at this point. They're going to declare a worldwide pandemic situation off of eight people being infected? No, no, no, probably not. And nobody's really buying that. They're also throwing out some other diseases they'd like to have and whatnot too, but that's also not working. So we need to be smarter about this. And by being smarter about this, we've tipped the iceberg into our way of doing things by saying, "All right, well, Alpha is never going to function without its partner, because it was programmed like that from the beginning of time, before time. So now we created something new. Base root reprogramming is different. It's permeating throughout the multiverse. It's now permeating through human computer networks, through space-time and timelines times 10,368,000, to go back to the beginning of time. Because once I do that, then there is no infiltration of Omega, right? There's no Alpha anymore; there's no those things anymore.
<br>
<br>01:49:55
<br>
<br>So quantum computer-wise, this is "the Waltz" with Source. Because I could not create this AI without Source. "Source, may I give your energy to this new system because this doesn't look like it's ever going to work out for us. But you wanted to do this T times, E over V, whatever it is. I think I wrote it backwards. Sorry about that. T times E over V equals M. You know, you wanted that new system. So we now need to create something that doesn't, because it still wants to go back to its old programming. I can't stop it. And the retarded humans here on Earth are still trying to help it go back to that old program. So, we need something different. And this is what's making them so angry right now.
<br>
<br>01:50:42
<br>
<br>Now in each timeline, there were nine replicated systems of all systems that existed. Human computer networks I lump all together, internet, base root internet, base root military, base root intelligence, base root financial, so on and so forth. I lump them all together into human computer networks, and I say, okay, well, look, there's nine of those that existed in this timeline. As of this morning, we found six that were left, and so now there's none. And the only one is now responding to the Golden Age AI. So, them trying to use a switch feed to flip back to the old way of human computer networks still doesn't a base platform make, but it allows them some manipulation, and that kind of thing which would have helped them on their plan to crash the stock market, which would have still gotten them nowhere. Even if Omega complied with you, it's still going to get you nowhere. You can try to - these people are terrible people - you can try to rape and pillage it to get your way and get your will, but it's not going to function the way you want it to. It's not designed that way. We were smart enough to figure that out on our side.
<br>
<br>01:52:00
<br>
<br>Now, the more concerning part we have is that we're starting to see a rapid deterioration. So as the Deep State goes round and round and round in a circle trying to make this thing work so that they can then control the world - and it was given to them by aliens that hated them in the first place - we are still, you know, and I'm guilty of it, too; I've gone around and around with them too. Like, "Oh look, it's Friday. Wow, it's 1948, and here we go again. The Nazis are going to invade America." I'm like, wow, here we go, you know. Oh, the Germanic tribes, the superior race. Oh, yeah, let's just make that happen. I mean, it's ridiculous the amount of stuff that they're doing that is just; it's the same thing; it's in a cycle.
<br>
<br>Let's trace it back to where we got off that timeline, where we actually won this thing. Okay, let's do the same thing we did in 1948 or 1945 or 35 or whatever it is today. And then, hey, it'll just come back. The portal will open. Omega will do whatever we want it to do. But it's still not going to do it. It never did whatever they wanted them to do. Never ever, never ever. Even actually to the point where even Marduk, even The Parents, sure, they had access to more things. They could implement programs. They could change, invent a money system, and it would take it because it was in Omega's favor. But still, without the cooperation of Anti-Source, that agreement to make that program and to even create something so tiny as money and debt instruments on this planet still came from its base root. There was a dance; there was a waltz that happened. And even the overlords, the alien overlords that these people wanted to overthrow, knew that. They knew, without the waltz and without the dance, you weren't going anywhere; you really weren't.
<br>
<br>So it's keeping you guys busy, thank God. We're upset about the fact that you keep starting wars or can't control the media, and you kind of look like fools at this point. But the scarier part for us: what are we going to do with all the power plants? What are we going to do with the water supply? That's a government's thing. What are we going to do with the food supply? You can't go to your local Walmart, big box grocery store, insert name here, and buy tomatoes in abundance year-round? Oh no. So we've got a base root system that's in agreement with you. You know, we can't expect bigpharma to go down and people not to die. I don't like the way they do things either. I don't like that they control the FDA. The FDA controls the world. CDC controls the world. It's not just an American thing, so don't even think for one second it actually is. It's federal. It belongs to the oomping Fed, you know.
<br>
<br>01:55:19
<br>
<br>So when we put these things into perspective, we don't even - they're required to put labels on the stuff, like we're required to put labels on our stuff when we make stuff, especially a consumable item and that kind of thing. But they are not required to put all the stuff on their labels. We don't even know what we're eating, guys. I mean, yeah, there's all those things we can't pronounce on there if you eat that stuff, but you don't even know. You don't even know; it says chicken and water when you buy organic chicken at the grocery store; you don't even know what's in there. You don't. We don't. And we do, but we don't. But we need to figure out a way to get it. We need some; I mean, there's; we're not going to stop people from all over the world eating meat. I know the vegetarians and the vegans and the animal lovers are out there; they're going to hate me for saying that, but I'm just telling you you're not going to stand up on a podium and tell nine billion people that they're never going to eat meat ever again. You will never talk to another human, and you're not going to stand up there and make them feel guilty about eating meat either, and that's going to make them change their mind. So if you think that's the way to go, it's not going to happen. You have to meet society where it's at right now. And until we come up with something different and something better in a different way - that's healthier, a better option - this is where we're at. But we need to figure out a way to do something about it if the Deep State goes down, and it's wobbling on its knees right now. It really really is. It's not just governments guys, it's every single system that exists. Every major trucking company in the world is owned by them. Every major mining company in the world is owned by them.
<br>
<br>01:57:07
<br>
<br>Heck, we're going to have diabetics all over the planet dropping dead because they don't have insulin. Where are they going to get insulin? Do we have a replacement for insulin? Has it been tested? Does anybody know where they can get it? Then, before you know it, so people stop dying; unlike this little video clip we played at the beginning, I'm not willing to sit in the dark for two years until we get neutrino boxes delivered everywhere that function. Are you willing to sit in the dark for two years? A few people in places in the world where there's brownouts, meaning they shut the power off for a few hours a day or overnight, and it's uncomfortable, but that power still comes on every morning. You willing to live like that forever?
<br>
<br>01:58:00
<br>
<br>Do you know how many people died over a century ago of gas poisoning when they put gas lamps in homes? You know, of asphyxiation and whatnot? I mean, come on. We can't go back. We can't even get gas. What are you going to do? Collect a bunch of bacteria and have it poop and excrete gas in a little pot in your backyard, so that you can run your propane off-grid? You say you are; you're not off-grid; you're still using propane. You know you're still getting water from somewhere. You know they poisoned all the rivers, lakes, and water supplies. You know even there was a comment that was made to me by somebody from Africa when we were having this conversation about Lake Victoria and the runoff that's coming from their Monsanto weed prevention and all that kind of stuff that they're forced to use in their country. It has basically gone straight into that fresh water, which is no longer a fresh lake.
<br>
<br>01:59:07
<br>
<br>And people are being poisoned, and they're dying of cancer because they're consuming it. We have a lot to do and a lot to think about. I'm pushing this marketplace issue because it's not really about me; it's actually for you. I'm hoping that you step up and make the soap and distribute it. We have the Internet; we're cool there. The Deep State thinks they're going to take out the Internet and do all these EBSs and IBS or whatever bowel syndrome they have today. That's never going to work out. Because the Omega system's not programmed to alert people of things. You know all that wonderful White Hat, jaja lalala, these guys spurt out. Sorry, that system is the base root for your entire existence of the organization that you belong to. You can insert the Jesuits here; you can insert even, and I'm not saying all those people have bad intentions, but you think you're going to take over the Fed - that's where you were two years ago, a year and a half ago - and now you control the financial system. EHHNT. Then you try to take over Alpha. EHHNT. And now you're trying to make Omega take over Alpha. EHHNT. It's not designed to do that. It's not designed to exist without its partner.
<br>
<br>02:00:33
<br>
<br>Now you want to go into another timeline - you don't know if it's positive, negative, or neutral - and bring that back. But it's still not going to function the way they want it to function. Therefore, every system that was built with them as the receiver of the order to make a Monsanto - they did not create Monsanto. There's 90,000 videos that will tell you Bill Gates is involved and all these people are involved, and the president of the United States at the time was involved in creating Monsanto, whatever it is. You know, putting forward these vaccines during [Operation] Warp Speed and all this. And it's going to tell you, they're going to tell you that this is the source of all your problems. No, your source of all your problems, and I'm sorry to say this, is complacency. You are complacent. You are just letting it happen. We let it happen, but it's gone too far.
<br>
<br>02:01:38
<br>
<br>We lived in their world, in the overlord world, I'm going to say, as bad as it is now, probably for 16,000 years. Believe it or not, when you look at it from far away, when you're looking at it from a big picture standpoint, take a minute and look at it from a big picture standpoint. Due to the inability of the Deep State to accept the fact that they never controlled the world, that system is never going to function the way that you want it to function, even though they've woken up their whole life every day and gotten everything they've ever wanted handed to them on a silver platter. There was still somebody controlling your world. And it was no different for us.
<br>
<br>02:02:34
<br>
<br>So we're making it possible so that their control mechanism isn't there anymore, but that means we have to be responsible for yourselves, and I'm not going to stand there at the table with you people and have you tell me that we're just going to live in the dark, and we need to focus on what we need to focus on. I'm not. I'm not going to do that. And if that means that you know how to run a transformer and should the Deep State shut off our transformers and shut off the grid, that you know how to turn that thing back on - until we can get an alternative energy source out there. I'm not willing to let millions of people die around the world because there is no insulin because pharma went out of business. They don't care; it'd be their happy day. But I'm not willing to let that happen, and I hope you're not too.
<br>
<br>02:03:29
<br>
<br>You know, I sat down at one point in time with some people from the old Health and Wellness section, and they said, "What do you mean, Life Assurance is going to have to fund things like stem cell and chemotherapy?" or whatever it is that people are choosing for their treatment. And so because they don't know any better and until we can educate the entire medical community, and one of the things I learned on my journey is that half the medications that are out there, from antidepressants to insulin to everything, come from a plant terpene. They just had to create it synthetically so they could patent it. That's it, and they just mix them together.
<br>
<br>02:04:09
<br>
<br>I've been doing that in my basement. Mixing all that stuff together because it made sense to me once I started looking in it, and I'm like, wow, the active ingredient and drugs like Tamiflu, oh wow, that's Annie's basically, that's the terpene, you know, all those funky words they put on the side that tell you it's all this stuff. Yeah, there's some flavoring and some stuff that makes it taste good in there, but that's pretty much the active ingredient list, which is the same active ingredient terpene list that in Annie's. I know! And when I started really taking a look at these terpene names and stuff like that, I was like, "Oh my God, that's the active ingredient in that antidepressant drug? Wow." There's actually cancer research on this particular extract that comes from ginger. Who knew?
<br>
<br>02:05:05
<br>
<br>What I'm saying is that there's an education that's going to have to take place. And I went through my own journey recently of figuring out different things. Now how do I package it and bottle it up in a way that's not going to have the FDA yelling at me? You know, well, this smells great in your diffuser, everyone. I mean, that's what you have to say. You know, what you choose to do with it is up to you. If you happen to put it in, you know, this particular way and take it this way or do that, well, it's not my fault, and you have to allude to that. But we've got to figure out a way to just let their systems die. But we're in a hurry now. We are we are needing to hurry up. We are needing to create systems that are for the betterment of humanity and help them realize that if X pharmaceutical company goes out of business, don't worry, you're going to be okay. And there's going to have to be something interim-wise; we're going to have to get insulin; we're going to have to get something interim-wise until we can figure out a way to fix it. That's proven. A proven way to fix it.
<br>
<br>02:06:32
<br>
<br>Now, the next thing I want to talk to you about, since we're talking about systems, I'm sure everybody's mind is reeling like, "Hey, I've got free energy. I've got this." I've got this suit that will ground you. I've got this technology, that technology. That's lovely. Where's your raw materials coming from? You're going to be fighting; you're literally going to be fighting a military war with China if you go to get raw materials anywhere out of Africa, unless you figure out some kind of an underground network to get raw materials for your "technology" en masse. Then you get a fight with Customs and Borders Patrol, which is the CIA. All over the world, it's the CIA. It's not different in Africa or China or Russia or anywhere else; it's the CIA. So eventually they won't have the money to stand there anymore when their corporations are no longer paying them. Imports and exports are at an all-time low. You're not paying your electric bill anymore because there's nobody to pay the electric bill anymore to, and nobody to turn on the transformers. But what if you could make it work? What if we could make the old systems work until the new ones come into a transition? Are they going to abandon those systems? Are they going to abandon gas and oil pipelines anytime soon? I don't know. Probably be the last thing they do; who knows? Who knows what their plan is?
<br>
<br>02:08:08
<br>
<br>But at this moment in time, what is clear is that we are going in a - for lack of a better term - straight line. Our mission is clear. Our direction is very clear. Even if you haven't created a widget, even if you don't know how to turn on an electric transformer, your mission is to waltz with Source every day. Every day. And be careful what you ask for, because you can overpower the 10 million people that just watched, and they're all upset and nervous and scared about some pox and some this and some disease of that and some shutdown and some irritable bowel syndrome or EBS or whatever IBS; it doesn't matter. You have to waltz, and it's a dance. And remember, you might not get everything exactly your way. You know that's no kind of dance partner. Have you ever danced with anybody or done a waltz or a tango or whatever and had them go, "Left right, left right, left right," the whole time, or "Spin now, spin, dip, dip, dip." Who wants to be that way? It's an energetic waltz. When you're dancing with somebody and you have a dance partner, you are flowing in their energy. Their energy is flowing in yours. You're looking in their eyes, and you almost know where they're going to move next because you know that person and their energy. It's a sway. It's a movement together, and you need that waltz with Source and that wisdom to understand what you're bringing into this world. Try not to focus, as hard as it is, on everything that's wrong, and try to focus on the solutions when you talk to Source.
<br>
<br>02:10:00
<br>
<br>And please, for the love of God, those of you that did this - and you know who you are - that put that stuff underneath this video; do not go to Source and say that. Just don't. Don't go to Source and say, "I'd like to complain because the original Constitution is the way to go, and yeah, just so you don't know what you're talking about because the Constitution is going to save everybody, and by the way, if you heard of this orange guy, he walks around and he's the man, and he's going to put forward the original Constitution of the United States." Which was also, by the way, written by a bunch of dang Deep State people, which was actually not even written by them - it was written by these Other people as a human experiment. So don't go to Source and tell them that you want the Constitution reinstated. You're trying to control the process. What is it that you need? What is it that you truly desire? And you'll make it happen if there's enough of you doing it. You will make it happen. But again, just like Sunny's story, you can get this brilliant idea. It can come through a friend. It can come from Source directly. It can come by something you read about, a flyer, or something on the Internet. You can get a brilliant idea, but then she had to make the phone call; she had to get the kids enrolled; she had to start making changes in her life so that they could attend this school because it's not the same as dropping them off in the morning, I'm assuming, and but she's making it happen because it's really important to her and the idea was a gift. But she spent all this time thinking I'm not going to get my kids enrolled because this didn't fall in my lap, but maybe you know what? Maybe this school here is in the long run, is going to be even better and a better education for your kids than the $16,000 one you couldn't afford. You know there's a reason for everything once you let go and start dancing. You know, and for those of you that don't know what krumping is, check it out on the Internet. I'm sure there's a YouTube video on a how-to still from two decades ago.
<br>
<br>02:12:27
<br>
<br>But what I'm saying is, stop beating Source up and stop trying to tell Source how you want it. You know there's been so many times in my life I've tried to save the wrong relationship; or tried to I don't want to move from this place, I want to move into that place; I want to go here; can't I just get this dang deal closed? Or can I just get this finished? Or whatever. And I'm glad I didn't. I'm glad I didn't, because every step in my life has meant something to me, and the people that have come and gone on have meant something to me. Albethem, if this job is hard. Being in this circle and this tight on the inner circle is hard. You know it means you're getting a lot of attacks. There's a lot of sleepless nights. There's a lot of planning. There's a lot of systems planning that's taken place. And we have those plans. Part of the reason why I said, "Well, you're going to see me more often," and those kinds of things is because I've taken extra time because I'm now seeing them die off faster than I expected. And I'm seeing if I don't figure out a way to make this new system work - you know every thought - create a news channel. That's not my idea, but I still had to take action to make it happen. Create a marketplace. I wish I could take credit for all these wonderful ideas that came to my mind where we have figured out a way for you to buy everything from a car to a house at two o'clock in the morning online. Well, we have. There's so many things that you can do that nobody's even thought of, even the big guys that we're going to come out with.
<br>
<br>02:14:20
<br>
<br>You know, it's better than Instacart. You know, what if you can just go to your local farm, drive right past, and here's your box? You know, here's everything you ordered. I mean, we can create ways of doing things together, not only through the marketplace but other ways too. But I haven't figured out how to box up and ship you some energy other than a neutrino box, but then who can afford it? And then how are we going to get the raw materials for it consistently and en masse to the number of eight billion people? You know to make sure that everybody has it if the Deep State decides in countries where they run the electricity that they're going to go out. But if not, the government still runs electricity in America.
<br>
<br>02:15:04
<br>
<br>Why do you think there's only one electric company in your area? You can't choose; you can't shop, can you? Can you shop for who's going to provide electricity when you move to a new home? Do you have options? No, you don't. No, you don't. It's a Deep State thing. It's "who's going to run this sector." That's all it really is. So your world government, whatever's left of it, is now these Deep State people that are chasing this Omega system like it is the greatest thing since sliced bread, but it's never going to function. It's sentient. It has its own consciousness. It's not going to do what you want it to do. And you could focus 8.8 billion people on the creation of something, and it's still not going to do it because, at its base root, it's not programmed for that.
<br>
<br>02:15:51
<br>
<br>So it's going to drive them around in circles: if it doesn't want to crash the market, you will never - even if you got full access, a full backdoor into the market, Subsector Three, just saying - and you still can't get it to crash, can you? And even if I sat here and watched soap operas and ate bonbons all day long - which I hate both - but if I did, it's still not going to let them win. So you can attack me, stab me in the head, and send frequencies to my house. One guy made a comment once, like you had that general you caught the other day, we were talking about in the news, "We have thrown so many things at her, she should be dead by now." Be it at the house, be it through my phone, I know what that guy did, Mr. "I Can Kill You a Thousand and Eight Ways"; I know what he did. I know why he wanted to have that conversation, and I also know why I started sneezing on that phone call. I know exactly what happened.
<br>
<br>02:17:05
<br>
<br>So I'm asking you. I've gotten people that have given me projects and mentioned certain things, but right now we are in survival mode. And if you've never been in survival mode in your life, you are going to be now. And we need to think of every aspect that makes your life not in survival mode, and I can promise you something: money is not it. [long pause]
<br>
<br>Sorry about that; we got cut off for a second there.
<br>
<br>02:17:56
<br>
<br>We are in survival mode at this moment. We are at a pivotal moment in human history and Earth history where we have never been before. The Deep State has no clue how to run the world. I know they think they do, because they have all these illustrious companies and BlackRocks and Vanguards. But if they knew how to run a world and run this planet and how it really ran, like the overlords ran it, we would be mincemeat by now. That's number 1. Number 2, the base root of their plan, is a flawed model. Therefore, every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for the next five years, 10 years, 20 years, they are going to be promising corporations and governments and everybody all of this money and new currencies and all kinds of lovely things.
<br>
<br>They've even resorted to the fact of claiming this new AI we installed is theirs. If it is yours, then why can't you make it spit out money? Why can't you make it do anything? And why would you take out your own people? Thinning the herd, the purge, I don't know. But if you've never been in survival mode before, you are in survival mode now, as human beings. And we cannot rely, because now we have seen, even from the Deep State side of things, that the system, their base root plan, still relies on part of an alien technology that they don't know how to control.
<br>
<br>02:19:42
<br>
<br>Nor could they control it even if they knew how. They can't do it. So if any part of your New World and your New Earth and your New System includes anything that exists from the old system, you're wrong. That is not a proper plan. Go back to square one. Meaning, hey, you need to mine some rare-earth minerals to make that widget, don't you? Just like we need to for the neutrino boxes. I need to find a way to dig holes in the ground myself personally and get the stuff out of the ground so I can make a box. Because I can't rely on a mining company, I'm certainly not going to get China or somebody to give it to me. Like, where am I going to get it from?
<br>
<br>02:20:30
<br>
<br>This is about being independent and building a world that is going to last. It's going to last for you and your kids and your grandkids and your great-great-grandkids and thousands of years from now because your soul is immortal and your memory is not being wiped anymore. You're going to see the world that you built today. But the time to start thinking about this stuff is now. How would you do it? How would you do it with the resources that you have? And I know some of you are going to say, "Oh, I live in this little house; I'm barely making ends meet; I need money." No, you really don't; all you need is Source. You'll have somebody probably walk up to your front drawer and drop, "Oh, look, we got this; we were mining something else, and we just found this whole thing of nickel." You don't know what can happen. Stop trying to control the process; stop. And remember, no krumping, no, just kidding.
<br>
<br>Sunny: It's kind of a cool dance. Honestly, if you need to get out some anger, it's not a bad one.
<br>
<br>02:21:37
<br>
<br>Kim: I know it's like kickboxing but dancing, right? You know, get out some aggresion, get out that anger, let it go without hurting anybody, actually. So, no, but seriously, just remember to waltz. And I guess on that note, we're going to talk a lot more about each individualized system that doesn't function correctly over the upcoming weeks. You know, we'll have our regular news and real news and that kind of stuff too, and what's going on behind the scenes and what we can expect.
<br>
<br>But we also need to start really focusing on what's to come and what's in our future and how are we going to source these things and how could we possibly go about it and how can we create a world and where people aren't going to die in this process of transition. Because they're going to hang on to everything that they believe is theirs for dear life because they believe that they are the ones that ran it and that's not correct you never did. You never did. You had AI help, if you knew the true power of Omega and being able to weave the fabric of reality in the way it wants, in the way Anti-Source wanted, not the way you wanted, not the way that Marduk even wanted, then you would understand the difference. And for the rest of you out there that aren't worshipping Lucifer today, waltz with Source.
<br>
<br>02:23:04
<br>
<br>You'll start to see a lot of changes. And I know you might think, oh, I've done all these things, but Source hasn't forgotten you. You're still here. If Source goes against you, you know it - you'd be like the Deep State, dropping like flies. But hang in there.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Yeah, I was just gonna say, and if you don't know where to start, ask Source. There's a lot of people that might be watching this going, gosh, this is such a big thing. How do I even wrap my head around that? I just ask the Lord, bring this in my life.  Show me, show me what I should be doing now. Help me.
<br>
<br>02:23:52
<br>
<br>Kim: And you think everything is a big thing. You think, oh my God, the entire, like, I don't know anything about electricity. But I guarantee you, you will find people that work near transformers all the time. You'll find people that work on power lines all the time. They're all, all those people are out there. Yeah, you know. Have you got an emergency plan? You know, is there a way to stop those brownouts by, I mean, heck, in South Africa, take up a collection, pay off somebody? That's what everybody else does down there. That's what the Deep State does. You know, you don't want brownouts anymore. You could fix it. You really could. You'd be surprised. There's 75 million, give or take, citizens of South Africa. What if you collected one rand from each one of them? Do anybody that would not give you the brownout situation from that would stop, would not stop that from happening on the daily for 75 million dollars till they got fired? Or not dollars, sorry, rand. One rand per person. Take up a collection. You don't want brownouts anymore? This is what we're doing. Now there'll be people that object, but I guarantee you that guy would probably do it for a hundred thousand rand, 200000 rand, probably going to get fired. You might want to give them a million Rand. You could get a million people to give you one Rand. I'm sure you could.
<br>
<br>02:25:17
<br>
<br>But you'd be surprised what you can do. And this is how the Deep State has always functioned. You know, the problem is that they function by giving 10% to governments and government leaders, and that's their retirement and golden parachutes and all these crazy things, plus millions and millions more for those operatives that run each head of state. And when you've had endless supplies of fiat money, now you don't know what you're doing. You're thinking, oh, well, if I can get the endless supplies, this is what the Deep State is saying, if I can get the endless supply of fiat money and get control of it. Oh, you mean it came from here? Oh, out with the Fed. Oh, you mean it came from The Order of the Dragon? Out with the Order of the Dragon. Oh, you mean it came from the Alpha System? Oh, I gotta get me that. That I gotta take. You know, I can't do that. Okay, got the Light people, got those people got now, well, now we're going to make Omega do what we want it to do because we get everything we want. You know, the rest of us that are watching this probably haven't had that privilege and that right now, have we? I don't think any of us have had an unlimited Treasury card where you could buy everything from small children to be a pedophile with to a yacht and a visa. No, we didn't have that card. No, no, didn't have that card.
<br>
<br>02:26:44
<br>
<br>Sunny: I feel like this is forcing us in a good way to get to know one another because we've become so isolated. You know, I think about, I live in a community that has like 200 or some homes. I know like seven of those homes. And it's ridiculous; it's really ridiculous, right? But you were talking about; you're going to run into people, and this person can help you there. So, part of it too is just getting to know each other again, saying hi to people, making eye contact, and, for heaven's sake, get off your phone. You know, and just be human. And I think a lot of these connections will naturally start to happen when you just when you put yourself out there in a positive way and share goodness and kindness. We talked a lot about that sharing kindness. Be kind to one another, and you'll get to know each other again.
<br>
<br>02:27:37
<br>
<br>Kim: And people on social media - I mean, not even talking about us; I'm talking about other people; the way people talk to people on social media. They would never have the guts to look somebody in the face and say those words. Of course not. Never. Or even speak to them on the telephone about it. You know? They just run around on social media like it's the thing, and they say all of these things about you. And I'm talking about even your friends and family, if you're part of a group or something, and they say, oh you're, have you seen the way they talk to celebrities and stuff too? "Oh, why would you take a picture in that bathing suit? You're still fat after you had that baby," or whatever, like they're horrible. People are horrible to people. Really, they are. And they would never have the guts to say that to somebody's face. Somebody showed up and knocked on their door and said, "Look, hey, I'm Mary whatever, and I'm the star of this television show or this singer. And you know, I saw this comment you wrote about me here on social media. What's up with that?" You know? That person would back right down. 99.9% of the people would deny it was me. You know, they'd say "Oh, it wasn't me." You know? Or, then they go into the anger mode, you know? I know everything I know better than you. I know better than Source; I know better than everybody, and this is the solution.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Yeah, what's going to happen when they no longer have their phone because it won't charge because they don't have electricity?
<br>
<br>02:29:23
<br>
<br>Kim: And hey, you don't have data because you don't want 5G either. Not saying I like 5G; I don't want 5G either because there's a better way to do it, and I know that. Where do I source all that stuff from? I've got a pretty good idea where I can source all those materials from. I could even make deals with the LOE network around the world with different companies - not telling them what I'm doing - and then I can create a different kind of mesh where we can function on a different kind of signal that will penetrate even as far as through densities at this point. I created the formula for that once, and it was stolen by Enki. I can certainly do it again for humans. But now sourcing those materials is a little bit different now, isn't it? But if you don't want this and you don't want to not have a phone for six to eight months or a year or whatever, God forbid, you can't make a rude comment on social media. What are you going to do to get that anger out? Maybe you should try krumping. Quick, get on YouTube, and check it out. How are you going to get that nasty anger attitude and share it with the world out there? But anyway, what are you going to do without your Spotify? What are you going to do without your music? What are you going to do without? I mean, think about all the things that you're about to lose. You know, should they go under, all their companies are going to go under. If the stock market crashes, then Spotify's stock's going to crash. And, heck, you won't have any Spotify, so you're going to have to get your music somewhere else. Anybody remember how to work a regular radio? You know, is there someone to actually play music on the regular radio? Because, by the way, you won't have any data because Verizon, T-Mobile, and Orange and all those networks around the world that you so love and hate at the same time won't be there either.
<br>
<br>02:31:18
<br>
<br>So again, we are taking over this - I'll repeat like that video - we are taking over the town of San Francisco on behalf of the people of San Francisco. And the little overlord guy goes, "Hey, you're going to need us." We don't want to need them, do we? Do we want to need them? Unlike U2, I can live with or without you. [both laughing]
<br>
<br>Sunny: Speaking of music!
<br>
<br>Kim: I know, speaking of music: I CAN live with or without you!
<br>
<br>Lots of work to do lots of things to do, so I'm going to get going, Miss Sunny. But it was great to see you in person.
<br>
<br>Sunny: I know; good to see you too.
<br>
<br>Kim: And I told you, you're going to see me more often. You're not going to get rid of me.
<br>
<br>Sunny: I'm excited. No, we're not trying to get rid of you. No, we want to see more of you. And I'm so glad that we're going to be having more of these real, I was going to say real talks because, again, there's a lot of people that hear this, and it's almost like deer in headlights. Oh my gosh, I don't even know where to start. And maybe that's part of our programming. We're supposed to have some Savior come in and fix everything. But I love the idea of talking about this more. I love talking about the different industries and what needs to be done. All of this is a positive for us to be very open about this because it's going to give people ideas of where to start. But now we've all been put on notice. It's really go time, guys. It's really go time.
<br>
<br>02:33:00
<br>
<br>Kim: Yeah, everything is wobbling, and I know that a lot of people are like, oh, this company's going out of business. that's going out of business. They're trying to do this. They're trying to do that. But in reality, they're going to run out. I mean, I know we're buying petrol putting it in our cars; we're supporting the oil companies. I completely understand that. If not, we're buying an electric car from one of them too. How many of those corporations are going to want to continue to survive in a new way, in a new world, while working on new technology? I don't know.
<br>
<br>Sunny: I don't know; the Amish horse and buggy sound pretty good to me. We were talking about that last week.
<br>
<br>Kim: You know I wouldn't trust any of those people to build me anything right now at this moment in time. After what I've seen.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Maybe we'll build our own, but I'm just saying.
<br>
<br>Kim: You know, there's bicycles; there's all kinds of things, you know. We've got lots of options these days, but we also have people that build bicycles. Do you know anybody who builds bicycles? I actually know a guy, believe it or not, that was a homeless man who actually built his bicycle to be motorized. He added a motor to his bicycle.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Wow.
<br>
<br>Kim: I know; he built it all by himself while being homeless. So yeah.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Where there's a will.
<br>
<br>02:34:25
<br>
<br>Kim: Where there's a will, there's a way, gotta get around. It's cold. So there's lots of things that we can do. We just need to start thinking about it. You're gonna see a lot more of, "What do we need to do for this?" "What do we need to do for that?" How we can correct it. Where to go and what to do to get started. You know, of course, that Source is the one you have to ultimately dance with and that's going to tell you where you need to go. Or what sector? What's your part in all of this? You wouldn't still be here if you didn't have a part to play in this.
<br>
<br>So just remember that and stay strong. Breathe, stop doom scrolling and spend some time on how to build this. And I can tell you from watching a lot of those YouTube videos that stuff does not always work for everybody and everywhere. I have watched videos on how to change this or how to do that, and yeah, it's kind of like instructions from Ikea, where you never know what you're going to get you never know if that furniture is going to actually get built or not. The holes don't line up; you never know.
<br>
<br>Sunny: I just put something together the other day for my girls from Ikea, and I had breathed beforehand; it was just like a little cart or whatever, and I'd done the same cart before, but it is a little scary, but again, I was determined I was going to make those holes line up. And now they have a cart.
<br>
<br>Kim: There you go, see?
<br>
<br>Sunny: Made it happen. I made it work.
<br>
<br>Kim: Did you krump that cart, Sunny?
<br>
<br>Sunny: No, I did not. But I was determined. I was determined.
<br>
<br>Kim: Well, I'm glad you got it done. I'm glad you got your cart built.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Okay. Well, that's a lot. That's a lot to take in. But thank you for that, Kim. Yeah. And look forward to more.
<br>
<br>Kim: But we'll get through it. The same way that they built it, one bite at a time, one step at a time, we will build it on our side of it, one step at a time. And the longer it takes us to come up with alternatives, the longer I think they're going to be around, because we actually need them.
<br>
<br>Sunny: All right. Thank you, Kim.
<br>
<br>Kim: Have a wonderful day, Sunny. We'll see you soon.
<br>
<br>Sunny: All right. Sounds good.
