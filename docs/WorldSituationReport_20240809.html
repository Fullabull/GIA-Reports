World Situation Report
<br>2024-AUG-09 News</h2>

<br>00:36:23

<!-- TEASER:-->

<h4>And now the World Situation Report, with Kimberly Goguen from the office of the Guardian. In Asia a port explosion, and Japan declares a mega quake warning. Al Qaeda and ISIS are reappearing after Frontier, aka Blackwater, is spotted in Syria this week. And Santander Bank in Mexico is known for money laundering for both the Mexican president and U.S. politicians. And this week they got caught red-handed in a scam involving current United States military generals. All this and more in today's World Situation Report.</h4>

<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Now, here's the World Situation Report, with Kimberly Goguen and the Office of the Guardian.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Good morning, good evening, and good afternoon, depending on where you're watching us and what time you're watching the report. Okay, we got lots to talk about, lots in the real news, as well as going on behind the scenes.
<br>
<br>00:37:29
<br>
<br>So first of all, I'd like to talk about a port explosion in China. This port explosion was allegedly a Taiwanese ship carrying some kind of hazardous material that just happened to explode within the last 48 hours. As you know, there are definitely tensions going on between China and Taiwan, which are being provoked by the Deep State. The fact that it was a Taiwanese ship is not surprising to me in this particular case. And China is looking for a world war on the cheap. So I'm not surprised that they would orchestrate something like this in attempt - just in case there was a big payout today, which is another day ending in Y - that they would be able to then increase the tensions between China and Taiwan.
<br>
<br>00:38:34
<br>
<br>So I believe; that's my personal opinion on what's happening behind the scenes there. We are going to travel back and forth in time throughout history through the rest of this report because it appears that we're running the same operations - not 'we' per se, 'they', the Deep State - are running the same exact operations that they have run throughout the last several decades. So let's see. Okay, in Japan, there is also a megaquake warning that happened based on the Nankai Trough, which is an area off the coast, having an Earthquake, they say, at about 7.1. And this was also a similar region to the Earthquake that sparked the tsunami that happened in 2011. So are they looking to create the same situation? It's possible. Will they be able to create the same situation they did before? Highly doubtful.
<br>
<br>00:39:49
<br>
<br>They are trying to trigger these things through a network that simply doesn't exist anymore. There has always been a lot of, let's just say, 'alien technology' that's existed throughout the Teutonic plates in the Ring of Fire. There has also been a number of disturbances over in California, as we reported on in the last news too, which is on the San Andreas fault line and in that area, I should say, not too far away from that. And it appears that they would like to have a massive Earthquake of some sort. Like I said, have we experienced some disturbances during this Lions Gate that were different than the other Lions Gates? I would say yes, we have. Again, the technology is not from this planet, and I think the Deep State is just hoping that something is going to happen to this magnitude.
<br>Â 
<br>00:40:54
<br>
<br>So we've gone back to 2011, and a hopeful situation on behalf of the Deep State. Now, we're going to go back to about the late 90s, early 2000s with a reappearance allegedly of Al-Qaeda. Al-Qaeda, allegedly, there is a concert; well, that's not allegedly; I guess the concert actually was cancelled; it was a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna, because they found items - they don't say what they are - that have been linked to Al-Qaeda and ISIS. Apparently the Deep State would like to revive Al-Qaeda, which we know that was an American creation, also ISIS, which is also an American creation.
<br>
<br>00:41:5
<br>
<br>However, in this case, there might be something to this story that they're telling as far as the cancellation of the concert because within the last 48 hours, we have spotted top persons from a company that is called Frontier. Frontier, you would know as Blackwater. They say that Blackwater is no longer that kind of thing. But Eric Prince is still alive and well and running a lot of military operations. He's also been spotted in other places in the world where we have seen some situations going on. He and some of his known close associates; they've been seen in places like Bangladesh where there's a current coup. There was also a coup in Venezuela recently, and it wasn't that long ago that he was seen there again or that his people have been seen there again. And now they're in Syria, so we are definitely expecting something interesting to happen in that region.
<br>
<br>00:43:07
<br>
<br>I do know they are still heavily backed by the Chinese Deep State and the Chinese government. There are a lot of Chinese government corporations that are behind the company known as Frontier. Although he is not the CEO anymore, allegedly, because of some issues that happened during the Trump administration, he is still very active, let's just say, and... how do I put this in a nice way? In manipulation of global affairs on behalf of whomever hires him. I do know that there have been substantial campaign donations on behalf of certain orange people, or non-existent orange people, from this group in the past and in the present. I have seen a lot of talk between some Saudi Arabian royals in this group. I have also seen some talk between a gentleman by the name of Al Sadr, S-A-D-R, which is a well-known Iraqi Sadrist group, which is a very large group in the region. Not exactly sure; thus far I haven't gotten all of the phone conversations that have been taking place between that group and this other larger group.
<br>
<br>00:44:58
<br>
<br>Another group that has come into play that I've seen: they are a similarly large group; it just happens to be that Blackwater is well known. This group here is called Allied Universal. They did buy out - they look unassuming; they look like right now they do school security and, let's just say event security and those types of things if you look at their website - but it appears they have a lot of ties and they've been very busy individuals worldwide. They have bought out, not that long ago, a group called GS4, which was comparable to Blackwater in its day. And they appear to be expanding their global roots. They do have a lot of ties to folks like the Council on Foreign Relations, the Heritage Foundation, of which Henry Kissinger was a well-known member, AIPAC. They do have some reaches and involvement, let's just say, in what has happened recently over the last several months in the Gaza Strip and with Israel. They seem to be more involved with Israel at the moment than a lot of the other Middle Eastern countries with what has gone on.
<br>
<br>00:46:43
<br>
<br>They have had a lot of trips in the last few years to Kazakhstan, and Kazakhstan, for those of you that don't know, is very close to Ukraine, in which there seem to be officials from both sides of the war having meetings with these folks. So I don't know if you would consider them right or left, or as far as political parties or China, in this case China or the Black Sun. Black Sun would be the Republican Party. The Order of the Dragon would be the Democratic Party. If you don't know here in the U.S., blue specifically, that would be the Rothschild or British sector.
<br>
<br>And you know they kind of hit the radar because I'm like, "Who is this GS4?" Because there were some talks between some people that were from GS4 and, let's say, some representatives from Frontier, Blackwater, or whatever you call them these days. And at least they consider themselves; they're British, so they consider themselves still GS4, I guess, or that was the comment that was made. I don't know if they were selling their new company or their old one; I'm not sure. Or they have left that company. But it led me to the Allied Universal folks and a lot that they have been involved in.
<br>
<br>00:48:15
<br>
<br>So they appear to have some money behind them. I wouldn't call it significant, and not enough to start a world war or anything, but it's enough to cause a lot of disruptions worldwide. They do have some relationships. I believe that they do have an office in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and some others along the bOrder of the U.S. Therefore, there is a relationship with some groups, such as the Texas Rangers and some others, that are known to make a lot of money off of a lot of things that cross the border.
<br>
<br>So take a look at them. I mean, is this tied to these allied military forces that are going to save the world? You know, I'm not sure. At this point, there's going to be a lot more research, and that'll take place over the weekend. So we'll see what else we can find in that arena.
<br>
<br>00:49:23
<br>
<br>Okay. Speaking of the Middle East, let's continue on with the game that's been played. There is a bank; it is not based out of Dubai, but it is in Dubai; it's called 'LGbank.' And it's all one word. They claim that they are a crypto-focused bank, which means they're involved in Bitcoin and all of these types of things. Now, that might be true, but they're also involved in a lot of other things. Their origin is out of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. They do have a registration in the British Virgin Islands, but they consider themselves a global bank.
<br>
<br>Now, because they have a lot of different registrations, it appears that there's been a lot of talk between the crypto-focused Secret Space Program, Trump operatives, etc., etc., and members of this bank that appear to have started around November of 2023. I do have copies of some signed documents that I have received that also involve the Federal Reserve, and they are signed by some Federal Reserve consultants dating all the way back to November of 2023. These documents, in combination with the fact that there have been a ridiculous amount of C-130s flying all over the Middle East, most not all; obviously there's a lot of heavy equipment moving, preparation for a war, and that kind of thing. But there have been several that have been found to have lots of pallets of cash on them. For those of you that don't know, one pallet of cash is equal to about $100 million, and they are flying all over the place.
<br>
<br>00:51:39
<br>
<br>The weight varies depending on whether it's been touched, has oil from human hands or not on it, or it's uncut in pallets just like these. These have been found in a warehouse in the Middle East. There are several locations in the United Arab Emirates that have these pallets of cash. And it has come to our attention that other countries, going all the way back - this is our tour of history - in other countries such as Iran, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia, also in Syria, there is a significant amount of cash in Lebanon.
<br>
<br>To bring you way back in history, the Lebanese president that allowed for the bombing years ago in Lebanon still has been unable to spend his $100 million in a pallet that he was given back in the 80s for the bombing that took place in the country at that time. The Iranians are still trying to cash pallets of cash from the 1979 coup. There are also other pallets of cash in Saudi Arabia that date back to Desert Storm that they have been unsuccessful in using. And the list goes on and on. I also have seen some pallets in and around Malaysia beginning to resurface, and of course, the Philippines and those types of places.
<br>
<br>00:53:28
<br>
<br>For those of you that don't know, the Philippines - in the words of the Cabal - is probably the headquarters for where they think all of the gold in the world is, and all of the cash in the world is, and trinkets and artifacts - and none of this is actually the case. They believe that there are billions of metric tons of gold in the country; that is false. There never was. Was there at some point in time? Yes. The stories that you hear about Marcos aren't entirely true, other than the fact he held the position of Pindar, which means he was the head trustee for the Order of the Dragon for a while there. He did, when he was in jail, write a proposal to the Order - which landed him the Pindar position - of cross-collateralization of in-ground assets and how they could possibly use them to back a financial system. And then, of course, after he got the position, he went off the gold standard, and the rest is history. But they considered that to be momentous enough to have him as the leader of their group.
<br>
<br>00:54:49
<br>
<br>So as far as the Philippines are concerned, you always have Federal Reserve folks there, you have U.S. Military there all the time, you have the Federal Reserve there all of the time, and they're always trying to convince these people that they need to give up their gold, that they don't even have most of the time. There's not a whole lot of real gold there, not enough to support a country and certainly not enough to support the world. There are some mines and some other things that are there. But most of the trinkets from days of old or historical assets? It's tungsten. It's very well disguised tungsten, but tungsten nonetheless. Same weight. For those of you that don't know, gold or AU at 99% is pretty much the same weight as tungsten and the same size and that kind of thing. So they use tungsten a lot as fool's gold in the Philippines and in other areas of the world where they claim they have bunkers. So if you haven't looked, you can look at 'Marcos Gold' and look up images, and you'll see 9,000 different pictures of gold all over the world that allegedly is with these groups, or has been given to Saudi Arabia. Dubai has some; there's definitely pictures of stuff in Iraq and different areas of the world that have all these bars of gold stored in various locations. Thailand is another place. A lot of it has been changed out, switched out. It's the same thing as the scam they run with the GIA, or Gemological Institute, when they certify large amounts of gems or diamonds and they're cut, and then you run the risk of getting a replacement for that actual stone if it is something that can be used in some sort of technology that would be more advanced than anything you've ever seen on the open market anyway. This would be more like SSP-type technologies, or, at the time, Others' technologies.
<br>
<br>00:57:12
<br>
<br>But there's also been another person that I've attempted to do some business, I say 'attempted' loosely, more than a decade ago, that is involved in a lot of what you're seeing happening in the Middle East as well. And interesting guy, his name is Prince Al-Walid bin Talal Al-Saud; obviously he's from the Saudi Arabian royal family. For those of you that don't know, this person is half Lebanese and is also a cousin of Mayer Rothschild and the Rothschild family, as is the entire Saudi Arabian royal family. But this particular gentleman here is kind of a man about town. He's known in the past to have shares of Citibank. He makes a lot of investments on behalf of the family, quite wealthy unto his own, and also very eccentric behind the scenes. So there's a lot of dirt that the operatives that work with this gentleman have. And therefore, they have decided, over the course of the last several months, to call in a lot of favors in order to not allow that dirt to come out.
<br>
<br>00:58:50
<br>
<br>So they've been using him as their personal piggy bank for some time. Public investments that this man has made were to people such as Elon Musk, and his new XAI program that he wants to launch to the tune of around $24 billion is what they claim. I don't think it was quite that much, but in this particular case, who knows with these people? But that was the public announcement. Non-public announcements would be investments in destroying the central bank of Lebanon. That was one, not that long ago. You probably remember seeing that in the news. He definitely participated in that; he definitely bribed and paid off a lot of Lebanese officials in order to achieve that task. He also has some ties with Hezbollah and some other groups and is more than willing to pay for - on behalf of the operative groups that run him - those weapons that they acquire, usually from American what I call 'war-dog' companies - companies that have contracts and have the ability to buy and sell weapons to allegedly legitimate sources. So that being said, he's been participating a lot in what you've been seeing going on in the region. I am not surprised there.
<br>
<br>01:00:31
<br>
<br>Next. Speaking of funding for terrorists and how they go about it - we came across something really, really interesting in the last 48 hours as well. So it's a well-known fact that the military - the U.S. Military - is having a tough time funding and paying for their situation that they have created over in the Middle East and participated in, along with some high-ranking generals having a difficult time performing from the Global Headquarters - and not only American but also all around the world. And they were expecting, of course, Lions Gate windfalls and all this technology to come back to them and all of these sorts of things as well.  Well, that's been kind of waylaid and delayed. And there's a lot of promises to operatives and people who move weapons and move a lot of things to get this whole World War III thing started they'd like to have. And they have to come up with some money pretty quick. So they developed a little scam amongst themselves, and I'm going to tell you about it.
<br>
<br>01:01:48
<br>
<br>So they sent a person who is a military person, nobody high ranking, someone I would call 'cannon fodder' in this case. So they sent Mr. Cannon Fodder to Santander Bank in Mexico with a letter of credit that was originally signed by the ex-president of Brazil, Bolsonaro. And this letter of credit was involving the then vice president, Pence. And the reason, well, let's continue on. So he takes this letter of credit signed by Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro, by the way, is also an investor in this crypto bank in the Middle East because, boy, does stuff get thick this week, I can tell you. So they take this letter of credit to Santander Bank, says it's on behalf of Pence, and those of you that have been following for a long time will know that whoever is playing the part of Pence is actually not Pence, and whoever is playing the part of Mnuchin is actually not Mnuchin anymore. So we're not sure who those people are. And asked to receive some funds directly from an account that Pence had at Santander Bank. Now, the account's been dormant for a little while based on the fact that there's nobody to withdraw the funds anymore, nor did they want to create any kind of heat at that particular institution, because there's a lot of high-profile people that bank there at Santander Bank, not only in Mexico but in Spain and in other locations.
<br>
<br>01:03:54
<br>
<br>In this particular case, you have an account with a significant amount of funds in it, that belonged to Mike Pence and insert-false-company-name here. The other party that was getting an equal amount of significant funds would have been the Mexican President AMLO. So this American person actually has American and Mexican citizenship. This particular person is an American military person, and this particular person was chosen to go down there and handle the situation. Apparently there had been some prearrangements made by some higher-ranking generals and other folks that were involved in this deal at Santander Bank, and they were allowed to walk out with one and a half million dollars, which was to be wired to an account which he was provided, which he did push forward, and the money was wired to an account at PNC Bank in the United States.
<br>
<br>01:05:07
<br>
<br>The account that it was wired to was under the name of a General Radcliffe, actually. And they thought that this was fantastic, because what they then wanted to do was take the old letters of credit from last weekend's scam, which I told you was about $880 trillion worth of letters of credit that went nowhere as the lines were shut down and they couldn't do it offline anymore and that kind of thing, and get the rest of the money that was in this account to the tune of $678 billion. However, that account all of a sudden disappeared; I'm not sure what happened there; maybe it didn't like being touched by someone other than Mr. Pence, I don't know. And, it doesn't look like Radcliffe's able to bank at PNC either.
<br>
<br>01:06:03
<br>
<br>Santander Bank in Mexico has been notified of the fraud situation there. I don't expect them to do anything about it honestly, because Santander Bank is known forâthey're involved in a lot of things, let's just say. As are most large worldwide banks, I mean, let's be fair here, we shouldn't single them out, like they're doing anything wrong by hosting the account that Pence and the Mexican President AMLO have there at that bank, which affords them 10% of the profitability for all human trafficking that comes across the Mexican-American border. So, good business, I guess, it would have earned Pence $678 billion, and that's only from the time, which was probably maybe Trump's last year in office, so 2019 until now. So that's 4 or 5 years, $678 billion dollars, and that's only half of the 10 percent. AMLO had the other half.
<br>
<br>01:07:14
<br>
<br>So you can see how many people are coming across the border and how profitable it is for everyone, if that's 10%, to allow it to happen. Unfortunately, I didn't see, there might have been some smaller ancillary accounts for operatives or other, let's just call them other groups, that were involved in facilitating the human trafficking across the border. So for those of you that think that the Republican Party, aka 'orange people' would like to stop and put up that wall and all that kind of stuff, no, they just like to funnel it so they could actually control all of the trafficking across the borders, what it looks like, because they were making a hefty profit on all of that during the entire administration. And I even know the name of the guy that they threw in jail as cannon fodder who made the deal between AMLO and Pence. So I guess that was their attempt at trying to get some cash together to blow up the Middle East.
<br>
<br>01:08:20
<br>
<br>So on to today. You know, yesterday was 8-8. They felt that that was a significant day for them and that they should be making enormous amounts of cash by today. So far, we haven't seen a whole lot going on in the Middle East. I see a lot of preparations for World War III, like the port explosionâit just happens to involve Taiwan; issues in Japan; there is also a lot of talk about creating a civil war in the United States. They decided that maybe a civil war is not what they want in the U.S. This is what the Deep State is talking about. That possibly some civil unrest would be good though, because they feel that if there's a civil war here, that would shut down all American commerce, and that would really hurt all of the Deep State companies that operate out of the United States and import and export an awful lot. That could be oil and gas, that could be other large corporations like Dole, and so on and so forth; Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer - you can't export all those vaccines if we're having a civil war. So they're talking about possible civil unrest now. Now, I'm not sure how much more restless Americans can actually get when you've got one guy there telling all the patriots, "Get your guns, fight, fight, fight!" - all of that kind of thing. So you've got, they've got, probably a hundred, maybe a hundred million people, 80 million people all riled up and ready to fight and to go. So that's awesome, on their side of it. Great job, SSP, whatever's left of you, Umbrella Duck Dynasty people. Great job. Yep, way to destroy your own country that you allegedly have convinced the world that you're a patriot of.
<br>
<br>01:10:27
<br>
<br>But it doesn't look like they're going to have enough cash to pull it off. Again, today was another payday - no cash came, Lions Gate did not bear fruits of demons like they had hoped, and they are trying just pretty much like they always do. You know, it's another payday ending in Y. We anticipate them hacking all weekend.
<br>
<br>Meanwhile, on our side of it, things are going very good. We have a lot of things very clear right now as far as the gate and that Source current, which is what we were looking forward to. We don't have any of those old agreements anymore. You know, there's a few things that might be affecting us, from other locations, that kind of thing. But yeah, it's minimal and it fades out, and it's more than things coming through that you would call like black or antimatter or dark energy; we're more seeing things like, I guess you would say we're seeing things like that are coming through gray or kind of like a light gray, which means that there's too much of the light coming through of Source and all there is is just some kind of faded dust, so to speak.
<br>
<br>01:11:53
<br>
<br>They have been putting in an extra concerted effort, though - and I will say this - on sending out a lot of negative frequencies. Whether that is through regular military equipment, SSP equipment, they have been focused on really, really sending out these dark frequencies to humans. Frequencies, even like weird diseases - that kind of thing we've seen a lot of. You know, home of the 10-minute cold, that kind of thing. You feel terrible for a couple of hours, and all of a sudden you feel better. And whatever illness you thought you had just miraculously goes away. So I will say this: until we find every last place on this planet, and so far we're up to 432 of them as of today where they were sending different frequencies from, so until we locate every single place on this planet, I would suggest you take notice.
<br>
<br>01:13:04
<br>
<br>If you start feeling... anxious is one thing. If you feel like you are having an abnormal histamine response, like an allergy to something, like if you don't normally have summertime or wintertime allergies depending on where you are in the world, and you feel like you're sneezing, "Like, what is making me sneeze?" that kind of thing, and then you start feeling like you feel sick, I would ask you to take a few moments to breathe through it, put up your own frequency shield. Amplify that shield by doing something that makes you happy. It might be listening to music, playing with your kids or grandkids, or whoever that is, and really ramp up that frequency in your person and then see if it goes away. If it goes away, then you will know that this is not a physical cold, allergy, or illness. You will know that this is a frequency that is coming out against humans. Remember these people would like us all dead and off this planet if they had their way, because they would like to control the collective consciousness of only dark folks, aka them and their brood, so to speak.
<br>
<br>01:14:25
<br>
<br>So be ever mindful this weekend. We're going as fast as we can on our front. Feel free to recognize where you think it might be coming from; if you have those types of skills and you'd like to stop the machine from sending out the frequencies, if you can find it, then feel free to do that too. If it happens to be people all around you, hey, you don't need to have those people; they're coming after us; you have the right to defend your life and the life of an innocent always, even under Source Law. So keep that in mind. You are not as powerless as you think. Remember how powerful you are and that you can stand up for yourself. And you can fight frequencies; you can fight all of these things that are going on in this world. You have the power to do that; you have Source on your side; you have that more and more every single day of a direct connection, and you have the ability to fix it.
<br>
<br>01:15:36
<br>
<br>So don't think just because I'm saying, like, look, this is what's happening right now, that you don't have the ability to defend yourself. Because I have shown several people how to do that over the course of the last couple weeks and it keeps it from manifesting itself into a physical illness, that is something nobody wants. So that's what we're seeing going on around the world.
<br>
<br>And for the most part, as far as the Deep State, today has been nothing more than a hack-a-rama. I have seen every one of those 15 militaries, whoever's left of them, popping up on my radar. I have seen people I know that I've spoken to. I'm not going to say I know them like we're friends and we hang out and have barbecues, but that I've run across over the last several months that I've personally spoken to, involved in a lot of hacking, trying to revive old grids, really doing some detecting to see what's going on with the Lions Gate, trying to install Trump bucks or insert fake currency here, working with this LG Crypto Bank to try to put pallets of cash as backing behind various cryptocurrencies to, I don't know what their plan is from there on out, maybe issue a new world currencies of crypto. Maybe that's central bank digital currencies now they'd like to back, even though they're against them, of course, when they do their YouTube channel things and that sort of thing. But I'm sure that you know by morning I highly doubt there'll be anything in those warehouses, and I'm not sure how this bank is going to function after that either.
<br>
<br>01:17:37
<br>
<br>So I guess you could say that's pretty much what's been going on for the last 2 days. It's been very busy; don't get me wrong. The frequency thing was a big concern of ours, more so than any of this money and money laundering. I mean this has been going on for a long time. This is not anything new, but you know at least we're putting some perspective on how this then escalates into war if it's not stopped.
<br>
<br>You know, the world can only change with two different things: an act of God, as they say, because most people would recognize an act of God, or money. These people manipulate the world with money, with fear, with greed, and those types of things. They have destroyed nations. They have killed millions, if not billions, of people since they have been on or around this planet, both humans and non-humans, for their own benefit. Believe it or not, part of the reason why they do it is to save their own soul, to earn credits in Hell. Apparently Satan has its own cryptocurrency or something; I don't know. Anyway, that's our Deep State, and that's probably a long soul contract story for another day; of how the Deep State soul contracts differ from ours - the ones that they committed us to anyway, at least the non-humans did.
<br>
<br>01:19:15
<br>
<br>Yeah, so I guess that is the World Situation Report for the 9th of August, 2024, and hopefully, if we stay diligent all weekend, both ourselves and yourselves, we'll stay safe. And we'll make it through this Lions Gate. It allegedly is over on the 12th. Some say now the new Q-Crew is coming out and saying that it'll be over on the Super Blue Moon, which is this month as well - about 10 days from now - and we'll see. I don't know what they're thinking. But from our standpoint, I'm just looking forward to a world where we are restoring the planet and we don't have to consider these people anymore as a threat. So that is my wish for all of you for today.
<br>
<br>And that wraps up the news for today. Thank you so much for listening, and have a great weekend, everyone.
