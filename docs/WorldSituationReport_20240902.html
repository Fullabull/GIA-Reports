World Situation Report
<br>2024-Sep-02 News</h2>

<!-- TEASER:-->

<h3>And now, the World Situation Report, with Kimberly Goguen from the Office of the Guardian. The annual meeting started last night for the Order of the Dragon and the Order of the Black Sun, also known as the Illuminati. Lots of talk about big payouts that never happened has left them all very angry. The Order has lost in the "current wars." This is a huge win for humanity as the old balance systems continue to dissolve. False rumors are being spread about blackouts and emergencies. Find out the truth behind these claims.</h3>

<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Now here's Kimberly Goguen with the Office of the Guardian. Hi, Kim. Happy Monday.
<br>
<br>00:31:18
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Happy Monday and happy Labor Day if you're in the U.S.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>That's right.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>One of those holidays that we celebrate alleged slaves... Alleged slaves getting better pay. Woo! I know we're all feeling that. We're saying,
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>You've got to wonder, you know, "Let's celebrate working, working 40-hour work weeks! It's awesome. I love it!"
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>I don't even know what it's like to work 40 hours.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>I know, right? I guess it depends on what your job is.
<br>
<br>01:31:52
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Anyway, we hope you're enjoying your day regardless if you have the day off from work. Okay, I know that there are some people out there that are not enjoying their day today. So let's talk about those people. So the annual meeting of The Order, Orders plural, and the Illuminati as you call them, or the Order of the Dragon, Order of the Black Sun, would normally begin today, or last night actually. It begins on the new moon, and then it would end on the Harvest Moon, in which they would receive orders from those that are no longer with us and a lot of money to go along with those orders to execute on said orders. So now they've just decided that they're going to make them up, and they've been making them up now for several days, but they went public with this about 24 hours ago as to what their intentions are.
<br>
<br>01:32:53
<br>
<br>So let's talk about that so we can dispel some of these rumors that are going around. There's a lot of rumors and a lot of stories happening right now. Okay, number 1, they're basically saying that Nesara-Gesara will start and they are implementing it with their new quantum financial system. That is false number 1. Number 2, they do not have a quantum financial system. And number 3, the one they're claiming that is theirs, is actually ours. They have zero intention of implementing any kind of NESARA and GESARA, and that includes the U.S. military and other militaries that they're claiming are involved with this "global alliance."
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>So clarification Kim, are they literally saying that the system that we're supporting is theirs and that that is NESARA/GESARA?
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Oh yes.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Okay, so when we hear stuff on alternative media saying that NESARA/GESARA is starting, that is C.A.R.E. That is what we've been working toward. But it's... They're trying to rebrand it, basically.
<br>
<br>00:34:09
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Well, ours lives in reality based on the current state and economic state of affairs; theirs does not. If it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is [not] true. And in this case, their version of NESARA-GESARA means they're going to give you a universal income, which they can then determine if you qualify to receive any money in your bank account based on your social credit score. So they would allow you to exist, oh yes, and provide you with a limited income per month, and then if you go outside the lines, color outside the lines, which most of you watching this do color outside the lines, then they would then take away your income. And you would be left homeless until you comply with their requests. That's what the base root of their NESARA or GESARA actually is.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>But they obviously can't do that. No. So are they just saying this stuff in hopes of eventually getting control of the Light System? I'm confused as to why they're saying this and they're like, "Oh, this is ours," when it's not theirs. And they're not even saying they're going to do the same stuff we're doing.
<br>
<br>00:35:27
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Well, no, they're not. They have a set agenda, and it is a new moon today, which is when their meetings normally start - the night before. And therefore, they believe that the skies are going to open and they're going to be the recipients of all of these new control systems, which is not the case. There are no standing orders for that stuff anymore, past, present, and future. They may have gotten some information from some old book somewhere or some Looking Glass somewhere or something like that. That would have indicated that that would be the case this year, but of course it's not.
<br>
<br>So this is steamrolled into a number of different events that are taking place currently at this moment. Not all of them positive, but let's talk about this. So that is what they're promising the people. You know, they're also promising the people that they will be able to; there's going to be a reset of currencies and that they're going to all get paid. They have zero capacity to perform these functions, but I'm going to throw out these numbers, just a few of them here, to tell you about some of the programs and deals that they're making with various groups, and how this could positively or negatively affect humanity.
<br>
<br>00:36:57
<br>
<br>First of all, the Royal Bank of Zimbabwe, also known as the Central Bank of Zimbabwe, is due to receive $835 trillion within the next 72 hours. I know, isn't that amazing?
<br>
<br>Sunny [smirking]:
<br>
<br>Wow. Good for them.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Good for them. They're going to be very disappointed when nothing happens, but these promises were made based on the fact that Zimbabwe does have some in-ground reserves of gold and diamonds and other precious minerals and rare-earth minerals. And of course they would like to have them sign over all those minerals to the Deep State, which they did. The tribes of Zimbabwe did so, as well as the government, and all consented to sign over all their assets to the Deep State. Unfortunately for you, the tribes of Zimbabwe, and the Zimbabwe government, you already did that several hundred years ago, and therefore it has already been liened and is already in the system. It has been reallocated under the Global Repository for usage locally there only, and you do not have the right to reassign it over to the Deep State.
<br>
<br>So when they tried to leverage that, that obviously went out the window. So it rejected it, saying it had already been leveraged in the financial system.
<br>
<br>00:38:23
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Now did Zimbabwe get a copy of that? Do they know that it's been rejected?
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>No, they would never tell those people that. There is no word really to describe the Deep State at this moment, other than severely programmed and mentally deficient. And then this just goes to show you, and I'm pointing this out that I have a number of other central banks to cover here and the reason for these specific central banks, but it goes to show you that these people have never run a financial system in their life. Because these numbers would burn the financial system to the ground. So even if they had gotten control of said financial system, they would have burned it within 48 hours of them getting it, which is why they don't have it.
<br>
<br>Okay, next, the People's Bank of China, also known as the Central Bank of China, would now become the Central Bank of all of Asia. They signed that deal with China recently. Isn't that amazing?
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Incredible.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Now, yeah.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>I'm so impressed.
<br>
<br>00:39:33
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>And their initial deposit is going to be $5,144,760,000,000 - I'm using these exact numbers for a reason - dollars to kickstart their new venture at the Central Bank of all of Asia. Wow!
<br>
<br>Okay. And we have several central banks of Europe that are going to be participating in the control of the entire western half of Europe. And we have the Bundesbank, which is the Central Bank of Germany. For their participation in the Central Bank of all of Europe. They would receive $2,014,010,000,000.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>I wonder how they came up with these numbers.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>The Central Bank of France would receive $1,244,000,730,000. It's all in dollars, isn't that weird? But it is. Bank of Italy would receive $1 trillion, 135 billion, 605 - I know, where did this number come from? $605 million, 542 thousand and 549 dollars.
<br>
<br>Sunny [laughing]:
<br>
<br>"549 dollars!"
<br>
<br>00:40:56
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>I know. Isn't that amazing? I don't know where they got this from either. There's no math for this, so don't try to put regular math to any of this at all. The Swiss National Bank, Rothschild's favorite, $886,574,000,000. Bank of Spain, $861,564,000,000. Now we're going to go to the Central Bank of Latin America. This privilege has been bestowed upon Brazil apparently; they are going to be the central bank according to the Deep State of all of Latin America. Wow, this is like some game show! $856,248,000,000. The Bank of England is going to go back into the euro and become one of the central banks of all of Europe for the small sum of $758,014,000,000. I'm sorry! I'm trying to do this without laughing!
<br>
<br>Okay. The Reserve Bank of India shall become another Central Bank of Asia. Remember, they are going to try to launch fake BRICS currency here, so for their participation in the Central Bank of all of Asia, they would also receive a large sum. Now, the rest of them I don't have quite all of the information on yet. But Saudi Arabia is going to control all of the Middle East in a contract. I don't have an amount for that; I didn't quite get that. The Bank of Korea is also going to participate in the Central Bank of Asia. So I'm guessing that they're going to take assets that are being dispersed to other countries, possibly BRICS or something, and then trickle them into these other central banks. The Bank of Mexico is supposed to get money, probably from Brazil. I know the National Bank of Belgium is getting money from one of these European central banks, the Central Bank of Luxembourg. You know, they're trying to formulate these different areas.
<br>
<br>Remember, their goal was to have seven banks for international settlements for the world. And eventually, once they consolidated all these central banks under various umbrellas, they were going to issue a singular currency for the entire region. Lofty goals, isn't it? Considering they can't issue a currency, even cryptocurrency, at this point in time.
<br>
<br>00:43:32
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Who's "they" in this? Is this the Trump people? Who's making these promises?
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Oh yes. Oh yes. Actually, it's not just the Trump people. It's all of the operatives that are still working with the Secret Space Program. In addition to that, we also have the ACIO at Red Mountain in Alabama, along with some other Deep State operatives that were there - God rest all their souls - helping to dial for dollars like a telethon.
<br>
<br>Making deals with the Central Bank of Thailand, Central Bank of Indonesia, Central Bank of Argentina, the Czech National Bank, Central Bank of Lebanon, Central Bank of Turkey, Reserve Bank of Australia, National Bank of Poland, Bank of Israel, Bank of Greece, Central Bank of Ireland, Central Bank of Malaysia, Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates, Bank of Canada, Central Bank of Iraq, Central Bank of the Philippines, Central Bank of Nigeria, Central Bank of Peru, and the list goes on and on and on and on. Basically, if you have a name of a country, there's a few more here: Slovakia, the Central Bank of Colombia has joined, of course, the South Africa Reserve Bank, the Central Bank of Egypt, and all that stuff that's going on in Egypt over there that we've been talking about. Yeah, big payouts that aren't coming. Central Bank of Chile, Central Bank of the Republic of Uzbekistan, and Central Bank of Hungary, and those are the ones that we've heard about thus far.
<br>
<br>00:45:20
<br>
<br>So yes, you do have the participation of The Order of the Dragon, you have the participation of what's left of the Black Nobility, and you have the participation of all of the operatives in those respective countries. And the headquarters for that was at Red Mountain in Alabama. So that's no longer an issue. Nobody's dialing anything except maybe from another dimension somewhere at this moment in time from that particular location. But those that weren't in that location are definitely going loud and proud today because they're expecting big changes in their favor just to fall in their lap.
<br>
<br>Big access promises, big things. Everybody's fighting with everybody today. It's awful out there. So what I mean by that is the energy is terrible on their side. They're talking about things like playing fake alien cards. Militaries are involved. They're all yelling at each other because what they told the public is that this would all happen within 72 hours. Now by public, I mean central bank operators, heads of state, those kinds of things. So we still have about two more days before this giant multi-trillion quadrillion bill is due.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Does this coincide with some sort of an alignment or something? What's going to happen in two days, do they think? Or we're not sure.
<br>
<br>00:46:58
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>No, they just figured they'd give themselves three days after the new moon. New moon being today officially, exact time, sometime after nine PM Eastern today. So they figure three days within 72 hours of the new moon, all these illustrious gifts are going to be bestowed upon them so they can be kings of the world or Dr. Evil or whatever it is they want to be. So yeah, that would be a big "no" from us in every way shape or form.
<br>
<br>But they did make another huge, what I consider to be a huge mistake in the last three days. So if you watch alternative media, in some circles there is talk about the Hell's Angels going to Colorado to fight Venezuelan gangs that are causing an upheaval in a city called Aurora. And this is a good opportunity for me to explain to you who this group is. So it's worthy to tell the story because the operatives that set it up were intending to use them to create a civil war. Now that's both sides. They of course brought the Venezuelan gangs here in cooperation with the Silent Circle, and then they made an attempt to have the Venezuelan gangs attack some things in the territory of what you would consider the Hell's Angels. So now they're saying the Hell's Angels and a second other large, equally powerful biker group in the U.S. Now they're saying that they're going to go enact their revenge.
<br>
<br>00:49:04
<br>
<br>Now, this is where those particular operatives have a screw loose, a few sandwiches short of a picnic, whatever you want to call it, but that is where they have lost their mind, and I'll tell you why. I know they think they're gods, and I know they think they walk on water and that they know everything, but there are things about these groups you don't understand. If they did understand it, then they obviously think they're more superior or have control of them in some way, shape, or form, because knowing what I know about this group, that was a losing battle from the beginning.
<br>
<br>Okay, so let's talk about the Hells Angels. So Hells Angels, we think are a biker group. This is the public's perception. We do see them oftentimes performing charity work. We see them as a rough-and-tough biker gang that you don't want to mess with if you have them in your area where you live. And that's what we kind of know as the public about this group. We never hear much about them in the news. We never hear much about them in places where there's looting or crimes that we know of that kind of thing. And that's what we know.
<br>
<br>But here's what you don't know. The Hells Angels Group is part of a larger organization of which they are pretty much the head that expands worldwide. The Hell's Angels groups aren't just a bunch of guys that ride bikes. They are an independent organization that pretty much runs every black market trade route in the entire world.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Oh my gosh.
<br>
<br>00:50:58
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>They have their own sources of intelligence information in every intelligence agency in the world. They also have people within customs and borders. Every single port, every port authority in the world - there is no country on this Earth they can't get anything in or out of. (Wow.) Yep. Now they are well known for getting it done, and what I mean by that is they deliver. If they are willing to take a contract and it is not because they have an allegiance to any group anywhere. If they are willing to take a contract to deliver your goods to extradite people from countries and move them to other countries that need to be moved, it doesn't matter who it is or what it is; if they take the contract and agree, they will deliver at all costs.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>But they are independent from these other groups.
<br>
<br>00:52:07
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yeah. They do business with all the other groups. By groups I mean CIA, SSP, some of the mafia organizations in the world; anyone and anybody that needs things moved through their special, and I mean special, trade routes, these are your guys. For example, if somebody happens to be kidnapped somewhere, you can be as small as that. Someone happens to be kidnapped by a group somewhere, and you need to get them out of the country; that's who you call - because you'll get out, for sure.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Are they involved in trafficking?
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>More goods and services, but you know, in certain circumstances, when say, one of the groups happens to be stuck someplace and can't get out or that kind of thing, these guys will get you out. They do a lot of child advocacy, actually, Sunny, to the contrary in this country. Yeah, I think it's called Bikers Against Child Something or other, BACA, I think it's called. And they will actually go to make the child feel safe if they're speaking out against an aggressor, meaning whether that's a parent or a guardian or a bullying situation. If they have to go to court, as an example, they'll bring in a whole gang of bikers and sit there with that child so they feel safe to speak up.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>That's interesting. And that's not just a front. That's legit.
<br>
<br>00:53:42
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>No, they actually do it. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. But we'll tell you something about this group. God help you if you make some kind of a deal with them or you go after them, because you will have a worldwide network of bikers after you that you would not believe. They take care of their own. You go after them, their wives, their kids, their families, their trade routes, whatever it is within their own group; God help you.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>It kind of reminds me of the Silent Circle and how they had their group.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yeah, and it's kind of similar. These guys, however, do not; they're not really part of anything, but they're kind of a part of everything all at the same time. But that is what appears the operatives tried to do to them over the weekend by setting them up into... Yep, trying to... Civil War is out of their realm. They're not in for that. They're the transport people. So anyway, that's who the group actually is. But I don't know what kind of business they were trying to pull, because it must have been some low-level CIA agent or some kind of idiot that would actually think that you were going to pull them into starting civil war in the country.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Oh, so that was the gig: start a civil war; try to get the Hells Angels involved to start a civil war. But that's not what they do. Like you said, they're into trade and moving things from place to place.
<br>
<br>00:55:27
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yep. Yep.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>So was there a deal made? Was there something negotiated?
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>No. Okay. No. We checked. No. And they also checked because they've been putting their feelers out to figure out what the heck's going on here. You know? Why would? Because don't get me wrong. I mean, Venezuela has their own groups. All of Latin American's, let's just say "goods movers," let's call them "the goods," because they're not all legal here in the United States. Just call it goods moving services that would require goods moving services in and out of countries around the world in Latin America - all run by the Colombians. So how would they get the Colombians to be so dumb to try to go against another group that they have affiliations with to send Venezuelans to Colorado? Trillions of dollars to their central bank down there in Columbia? Promises that they're never going to deliver on? I did hear at one point that they promised the Colombian Central Bank, which is run by the Colombian mafia, by the way, as most all things are there. I would say that they promised them trillions of dollars, or they owe them trillions of dollars and don't intend to pay - or intend to make good on it through some fictitious fantasy quantum financial system they don't have.
<br>
<br>00:57:00
<br>
<br>I'm guessing that's how they did it because none of this makes sense to me when I know how the world really works. I'm not saying I agree with a lot of things that these people do, but I would say to you that you know where you can step and where never to step. You know, if you are, I don't really have any fear. I have less, let's just say, opposition from operatives doing ridiculous things than I would be concerned about a group like this. You know, we've crossed paths a few times, not in a negative way. I have, let's just say, appreciated some of the things that they've done when I don't know how I was going to get out of here or there or anywhere. So therefore, pretty much, they're none of my business. I leave them alone. I know better.
<br>
<br>But as far as talks we've had in the past, it would be about having a cooperative effort to move things into places we couldn't get them into. For example, right now, there's no food in Gaza. This would be an example. We would use them to get food into Gaza. I don't mean use them. I mean, their transport services are invaluable when it comes to hostile areas. In the future, when there isn't hostility, we are still going to have local, homegrown people that are still hostile. We'll have Boko Harams and all kinds of different groups that have formed over the years that are going to be hostile for a while. But if we need to get foods, natural medicines, or things delivered, these guys are your guys; they'll get anything in anywhere. There's no concern about it not getting there. Construction equipment.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Do you think they could be an ally at some point?
<br>
<br>00:59:09
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>I do. You know, I do. There may or may not have been; how do I say this in the quietest of ways? There may or may not have been some feelers put out as to whether or not they would even be interested in moving currencies around for us. You know, that kind of thing. But you know, when they started to waver against the operatives or not wanting to do things that the operatives wanted them to do, then all of a sudden they decided to set them up. Wrong move. But good move for us because these people go bump in the night. You're never going to see it in the news; you're never going to hear about it anywhere. It's going to be cleaned up, quiet, tidy, no civil war, no newsworthy event, no nothing. That's not how these people operate, and that's not how they work. So, like I said, they are for their own; before they're for anybody else, that's not their own.
<br>
<br>And so we'll see what happens with that, but this could get really interesting really fast. But I wouldn't expect some kind of big deal if you do happen to live in Aurora or the surrounding area, coming from any Hells Angels of any sort, in any way. If there is somebody that went against them over there, then there are probably further reaching consequences for that action than I'm thinking that the people that sent the Venezuelan gangs could ever possibly imagine. And I'm sure they know it down there. They probably lied to them and told them that they made a deal which they didn't do, and that kind of thing. So we'll see; we'll see what happens there.
<br>
<br>But we learn a lot of new information every day here on the news.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>That we do.
<br>
<br>01:01:07
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yeah, I mean, they're not a bad group of guys, I mean, and ladies, honestly, they're pretty much down-to-home kind of people. Not to say I would want to be in a bar fight or be on the wrong side in a dark alley with them, but I mean most of them are patriots. Like I said, they do - I can't believe you've never heard of BACA. You should look them up. It's pretty interesting. They do. They support those kids so that they can feel that they can stand up for themselves and stuff. It's nice.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Well, I do feel like there is hope for any group that actually supports kids and goes out of their way.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Well, they have kids too, you know.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Well, so does the Deep State!
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Well, they'll walk them to school, and bullying and that kind of thing, to make them feel like they're protected and strong, and -
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>I know, I love that!
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>And some things as parents, you know.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Yeah, that's a great program. Yeah. I didn't know that. That's amazing.
<br>
<br>01:02:09
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yeah, so that's where you'll probably find them around in the country. So, everybody's got - if you've made any kind of big money or become a big worldwide group in this world, you've got a past and you've got a history. So, let's see where they go from here; it's all, you never know. So let's see.
<br>
<br>Okay, let's talk about progress with or against the Alpha Omega AI versus the Golden Age AI system. As Alpha Omega struggles to survive - and at this point it's wriggling in a major way - there is a little bit of a "current war" going on. And by current, I don't necessarily just mean money; currency. I mean, it's struggling to try to push back in dark matter, dark energy, and dark essence, not only in our world but throughout the multiverse, so that it can survive.
<br>
<br>01:03:20
<br>
<br>It is failing to do so, and again we can thank those that have departed for that in part, and in part we can thank the departed seven hidden remaining. I use the term "archivist" lightly now because some new information came to light over the weekend that I figured I would share with you to tell you what these seven - well technically eight - remaining people were up to. So, Saturday morning, there were a lot of alerts going off based on these people. And there was one female in particular, probably somewhere between mid-40s to mid-50s, who is an American of Latino descent who was living in, or at least staying currently in, Argentina, who decided to be so bold as to actually reach out to me, and basically telling me that she has all the same capabilities that have been granted to her by Michael.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>So what Michael had she now has? Is that what she was trying to say?
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>That is what she's saying. Okay. And in part she didn't lie. And that she has every intention of destroying me. [giggling] I'm like, oh, okay! And in this world, if I don't comply with what she wants, and she clearly felt very superior to me. But you know, I'm not one to toot my horn on anything, anyway. I mean, I know that I'm only hands and feet to run for a much higher power on this planet, which apparently she cares nothing about. So she basically was calling to tell me she's taking over now, and then I can just sit down and do nothing. And yeah, this is how sick these people are.
<br>
<br>01:05:45
<br>
<br>So there was a partial consciousness transfer that came from Arch-and-Angel Michael - because it's one being - Raphael and Gabriel - to a few selected people. That consciousness transfer took place probably about a week or so before their departure, and it's been growing ever since. And so they did have some limited capacity as it relates to the realms, meaning the third density, first density, and second density. However, this lady did something really interesting. The lady had a daughter. Best I can tell, she was somewhere between 14 and 16 years old. She, as the parent of this girl, allowed for them to begin a consciousness transfer of Anti-Source into this human.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>And she somehow got that from... [unintelligible] through Michael? Okay...
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yep. And by the time she turns 40, because that would have been how long she would have lived. Sorry, not an innocent still at this point. Then that consciousness would have grown, and she would have played the role of the Antichrist. Yeah.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Oh my god. It's not funny. I just... I don't even know how to respond to some of this stuff. It's so insane.
<br>
<br>01:07:31
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>It's so insane, but this is how the world really works. I know. I know. Trust me. I know. So after the conversation with me, which I really didn't say a whole lot to this lady, perhaps it was the look on my face that alluded to the fact that I thought she was nuts because I don't have a poker face and I know I'm not on camera today, but I really don't. I mean, when I don't like something, there's that "I have just sucked on a lemon" look on my face; I can't not have it. It's like the lies. If I don't believe what you're saying, you will know when you see my face.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Okay, so this was some sort of video call?
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yeah. There were four parties on her side. One man who was sitting in the dark, so I could only see a shadow and the fact that it was a man. It was like I could see the shadow. The other two I couldn't see. They were not on camera.
<br>
<br>Okay. With no name. All right. Yep.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Okay, so she basically put you on notice that you could step down now, and she was going to take over?
<br>
<br>01:08:54
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yeah, and you know, we fight each other in different ways. Meaning, it's entirely possible when you feel threatened to protect yourself, and you can throw energy anywhere at any time against somebody who you feel is attacking you. So she might have felt a little uncomfortable during that call, which kind of scared her because then she and her daughter who were in Argentina ended up going to an underground base in Antarctica to try to see if she could actually get, let's call it some kind of a power of attorney; it's not a power of attorney, but that's the best way I can explain it in layman's terms, over her daughter's abilities or future abilities. Because she realized, I think, that if she was going to actually battle and her daughter would live long enough to the age of 40 to recommit this Earth to the Anti-Source or whatever, that she needed some more juice than Michael gave her.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>And was she collaborating with other individuals that got some essence or whatever from these other archangels?
<br>
<br>01:10:05
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>You know, I suspect there was something more to the story, because the one thing that I saw - so you always have to observe a little bit before you torch an entire facility. The Enforcer actually did it. And so there were nine letters that this little girl was given that were only supposed to be one per year. She was supposed to open in the nine years before she turned 40. So she would have started at the age of 41, and she was supposed to open one of these letters, and they're not written in a human language that we would understand, and she brought those letters to CyberLife to try to decipher those letters to see what they said.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>So she did open them? And she wasn't supposed to.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>That's right. So if the girl had lived that long, and if that consciousness transfer had worked - which I highly doubt it would have worked for long - but if it actually did, then I think the language that it was written in, it's one I'm familiar with, she would have been able to read them.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>That's some sort of light language. Or would it have been a light language?
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Anti-light language, for lack of a better term.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Anti-light. Yeah, okay.
<br>
<br>01:11:26
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>It was the first language. It's almost like a frequency. It's written in essence, and unless there's no CyberLife equipment that's going to read those things, and I know they tried. God bless them. God rest their soul. But yeah, this lady was losing it. She lost her noodle. But again, she and her daughter did depart, as part of that facility takeout over the weekend.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Does that mean the essence is gone, returns to Source, or what happens to that?
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Of those letters?
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Of whatever was inside those people. Yeah, yes. Returns to Source.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yes. Okay. And the cords are cut, and there's no implant of any sort, and whatever Source does with them is totally up to Source. (Right.) At that point. But it just goes to show you the crazy things that exist in this world.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Well, it also makes you wonder what's going on with - if Rafael did that, like, what's going on with that side? Are you going to have two more instances of something like this because they passed something down to some other human?
<br>
<br>01:12:43
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Well, we searched far and wide; we found seven in total - other than the two of them. So, God, I hope not, but we'll see if there's anything else that comes up but they're gone. She's gone. No hope; have a nice day, SSP people, continuing on. Was this lady barking orders behind the scenes? Was she able to, is she the one that all this weirdo information was coming from? I have no idea. I don't know. But I do know she was promised a very high-up position, in control of the entire Orders, plural. Yeah, she told me that. She told me that she is taking over on the new moon, which was just two days from when we spoke. We spoke Saturday morning early. Yeah, so you know, okay. Anyway, so there's that.
<br>
<br>Now we're going to talk a little bit more about some other rumors that are floating around that I need to let you know why they're doing it and what it means for you. So this is a little video that's been circulating around Twitter and amongst the Q Crew, so let's let her rip:
<br>
<br>01:14:04
<br>[video begins playing]
<br>
<br>Announcer:
<br>
<br>This critical message is being delivered by the emergency alert system. This is not a test. We interrupt regular scheduled programming to notify you of an imminent threat to national security and public safety.
<br>
<br>[buzzing sounds]
<br>
<br>The U.S. Government has issued a national emergency for the continental United States, effective until 11.59 p.m. The following message is transmitted at the request of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. There have been multiple sightings of more than a dozen unidentified objects of unknown motive and origin that have landed across major population areas around the world. These unidentified suspended objects are around 1,400 feet long stone-like material of unknown nature, like that of a black oval stone flattened in shape resembling an enormous obsidian concave lens. These objects are suspected to be extra terrestrial and might endanger civilian populations. The United States Armed Forces have been deployed to the incident sites in order to investigate the unidentified objects. Given the uncertainty concerning these objects, all non-essential services have been instructed to cease; all planned flights have already been cancelled; and all ongoing flights have been redirected to the closest airport in proximity to their location. At this moment, all civilians outside of danger zones are urged to seek shelter, pack enough food, water, clothes, medical supplies, a flashlight, important documents, a first aid kit, toiletries, and a battery-powered or hand-crank radio to endure the course of the emergency.
<br>
<br>Residents in the designated danger zones must evacuate to neighboring states. All citizens crossing state borders will be subjected to compulsory health inspection. Refusal of health inspection will result in refusal of entry. If you witness any strange vehicles or objects, you must leave the place immediately and contact the National Emergency Self-Report Hotline.
<br>
<br>710-726-7834.
<br>
<br>710-999-8274.
<br>
<br>This critical message is being transmitted at the request of the White House. A presidential alert has been issued. The following message is a written statement from the President of the United States:
<br>
<br>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, and other national space agencies have determined that these objects are hostile and originally belong to a distant extra-terrestrial civilization. Attacks from these unidentified objects have been reported from across Europe and Asia. NORAD reports that more unidentified objects continue to descend into the Earth's atmosphere. According to accounts, these objects are containing unknown entities that have dismounted from the object and are wandering across the landscape. These entities are regarded to be technologically advanced.
<br>
<br>The United States and the rest of the globe are under attack. These entities are reported to be using unidentified directed energy weapon beams. This beam produces extremely dangerous radiation in the form of a beam, powerful enough to completely vaporize anyone in its path. All known diplomatic efforts with the entities have been futile. The entity is said to possess extraordinary speed, endurance, violent behavior, and resistance to conventional weapons. All law enforcement, civil service, and military personnel must report to the closest military facility and take Eddie and all power offensive.
<br>
<br>[end of video]
<br>
<br>01:18:45
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>I have no idea what I just watched. I think that was "War of the Worlds - Part 2".
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>You and I are in the danger zone, Sunny.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>What was that?
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>We're both in the danger zone.
<br>
<br>Sunny [laughing]:
<br>
<br>Now I'm flashing! Oh my goodness!
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>I know.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>I don't fully understand what I saw. It kind of feels - obviously to create fear and whatever. So this is on Twitter, and where?
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yeah, it's circulated on Telegram; it's all over the place. Now for those of you that don't know, and this is a part of the information here, the 710 area code here in the United States in 1983 is when they created this area code, and it's specifically to be only used by emergency services in the United States, by the United States government. Now we did call the number, and it just beeps like you're leaving a message on an old-fashioned answering machine of some sort. But the interesting thing is, how do these people get a U.S. government emergency services phone number?
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Well, they would have to be connected somehow. They would have to have access to that.
<br>
<br>01:20:03
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yes, they would have to be. So you mean to tell me that there are people... Now, first of all, there is no official announcement, meaning FEMA knows nothing about it. You call FEMA; they don't know anything. You call NORAD; they don't know anything. You call; we've got contacts within the U.S. government; they don't know anything. You know, like if you call, just a regular person calling, they don't know anything. White House doesn't know anything. Even from inside people in the White House, they don't know anything. And of course our president's not writing anything now, is he?
<br>
<br>But this is - first of all, I just want to dispel these rumors. Number 1: No giant concave obsidian made-of material or otherwise, 1400 foot-wide concave disks are hovering over areas in the world. No beings have crawled out of said disks and are going anywhere. I think they wish; we all know that Q people are run by the SSP and Umbrella Military Corporation. I am sure they would love to have some portable portals open up and have some help up in here to achieve their objectives, but none of that is actually happening. Nothing. But they are trying desperately to play what I call the alien card. I know. I feel like it's the 1930s, that war of the world thing that came out.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>That's what I said! It's the modern-day "War of the World."
<br>
<br>01:21:41
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yep. Nothing is new. It's not like these people are so creative. And who knows if it didn't come from the crazy big lady that's no longer with us? I don't know. Where do they come up with this stuff? Well, they didn't, right? It already happened.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Right. And well, they have been kind of flaunting this idea of Project Bluebeam. But that's not Project Bluebeam! That is like a MacGyvered version of Project Bluebeam. Like really low budget. They can't even spell some other words, right guys. Use spell check. Next time you want to come out with a fake EBS, use spell check, please.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yeah, I know. You know, they, but anyway, the point is that these rumors are ridiculous. There's nothing that fell. There's no panic. There's nothing. No flights are canceled. I've been checking FlightAware and all that. None of that actually happened. And this looks like another "War of the Worlds" type hoax that is meant to create fear amongst a community that has a lot of followers. You know, they do.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Kim, do you think it was a test of some sort to see how people would respond in the community? Would it be shared? You know, I know they use us as lab rats all the time to figure out how humanity would respond to something.
<br>
<br>01:23:00
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Well, it probably was to see how they would actually respond. Do you remember a few months back - the balloon incident?
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Of course, yeah.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>And during the course of the balloon incident, I call it the "Balloon Affair," I don't know, where we had attack balloons from China allegedly floating around the U.S. And these attack balloons - there was an official Pentagon briefing actually on it, which they quickly made disappear. But I think we had played portions of it in our news at the time. And where the Pentagon was actually coming out and saying they think there's an alien invasion, "They're alien balloons, we don't know," that kind of thing. And to test to see what the public would say. Well, clearly, that test failed. Maybe they thought that people would be more amenable now to this crazy idea. And I think if there was a 1400-foot-tall giant disk hovering, as depicted in this picture here, that they show on their little warning in California, you would know.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>I think I would know. I think anyone on any kind of social media would know.
<br>
<br>01:24:20
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>That's right. And you know, there would also be 90,000 TikTok videos by now.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Exactly.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>You know, from different people. I mean, if you were going to run something like that, wouldn't you have people kind of concurring with your statement? And then coincidentally, it's really weird; there's a movie out there called "The Arrival," and it looks just like what's depicted in that movie.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Wow. They probably just took a screenshot. Very low budget. Very low budget.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Very low budget. Yeah. Well, not for long though, according to them. They'll have trillions of dollars in the next 72 hours.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Oh, yeah. Yeah.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yeah, this is just a "pay you Tuesday for a video today." See, they didn't even use like fiber or something because even those people would have given them some kind of a spell checker.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>So, I mentioned Project Blue Beam. Do they have any ability to actually carry out some sort of fake alien evasion, whether it's their own ships or whether it is holographic images like we saw with 9/11? Do they have any capability at this point to do something like that?
<br>
<br>01:25:25
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Well, Blue Beam implies "blue," right? We're "Color Wars," remember? We talked about this. And remember how we talked about the fact that all the colors, different colors, had a hologram that would surround Earth? So their ability to create some kind of fake war of the worlds in the air on our hologram in projection in combination because this is how Blue Beam was supposed to work. It was supposed to be projected onto the hologram, and then they would obviously use some kind of 9/11-type imploding technology on the ground to make it look like there was a beam coming from a giant alien spaceship that attacked insert tall, well-known building name here. We won't go into that because they had their specific buildings they were going after, which they did shoot one of those ahead of time, known as 9/11, with holographic planes and other things that took place there. Not saying that the experience wasn't very real for the people on the ground and the thousands of people that died, but the show did not include an alien invasion. They decided not to and called it "terrorists on planes," because that was more believable for people to go into a full-on panic. And then we escalated into, obviously, hunting terrorists in the Middle East, which the intended effect was there, carried out decently. Because it came from somebody else; it wasn't something that they created.
<br>
<br>So they were going to attack these well-known buildings, insert building name here, which were already wired to blow. We've found many of them: Chicago trade towers, all these - they're gone now. That alien tech's not there. And then it would look to the public like, "Oh, here's the aliens shooting down, killing our towers and our people." And this was a preface for that.
<br>
<br>01:27:30
<br>
<br>I'm pretty sure they probably thought they were getting that technology back as part of this extravaganza over the next few days. They're also talking on the same channels, with the clock thing, because this will end up on YouTube - we don't need another strike because it's bullying at this point - they are saying that there's going to be a gate on 9/9, so that's five days away from now. Maybe this is to preface that in case that happens and they win some demons or something.
<br>
<br>I don't know. But I can tell you that the only thing that they are doing is losing more and more abilities by the day. That's what they're losing. And they will continue to lose more and more by the day. And if they don't stop making ridiculous deals with people you don't want to mess with, then they're going to lose a lot more than just a few alien pieces of technology. They're going to lose a lot more. But it's going to be an interesting couple of weeks for us on my side of it because we're - like I said, I'm not really chasing them around anymore - but these are things that come up on the radar that need to be addressed. I mean, I can't not talk about these things and how weird they are. You know, like some of this is just weird. These are ongoing operations and things that they're doing to some degree. We need to dispel rumors of ridiculous amounts of liquidity coming into the system from people that have zero capacity to do so. They do not have a quantum AI sentient system like they think they do. That stuff is not coming back. The lady is dead. The other counterparts are dead.
<br>
<br>01:29:25
<br>
<br>There's nobody left to talk about. There's nobody left to talk to. I can't stress to you enough the ridiculousness of all the stuff that they're putting out there. You know, it's more entertaining really than a movie. You know, like there's no movie that is as good as the one that we - that's actually things happening in the world that we actually talk about. It's real. It's really happening. And you know, hopefully the movie's going to end where we all win and humanity is thriving, and the sequel talks about all the new projects that you're going to be doing and what C.A.R.E. is doing in the world. And that's the way the movie's going to end. That is the way the movie is going to end. Yeah.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>There's no "hoping." That IS the ending of this movie.
<br>
<br>01:30:12
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>That is the ending of this movie, or the beginning of the sequels and things that are to come. So, there's a little bit of damage control you've got to do every once in a while, and it's worth talking about. Meanwhile, I've spent the majority of my time working on ensuring that we can have supply lines of things that we need. We can do things that we need to do, securing things like - you know, there's no point in trying to build a building or a clinic somewhere if you don't have any either lumber or steel or something to build it with, right? We have to secure those lines. And a lot of those things have been taken over by the Deep State, or they're being produced out of Asia with substandard materials. And we don't want substandard materials.
<br>
<br>And we also need to have independent labs to test said materials, because this is important to us. We don't want to build a building with steel that is not up to the specs it says, which happens all the time, and we need to look at something else. We need to look at another place where we can source that. With all the sanctions that are going on with Russia and in other countries, a lot of those sources are considered black market sources at this point.
<br>
<br>01:31:33
<br>
<br>But you always know somebody who knows somebody who knows somebody, and then, of course, if you got transport companies willing to transport for you as long as you got the money, then we can get it from here to there. So lots of things go through my mind, and I've been pretty much focused on that kind of stuff. Also been focused on working on some interesting things with some Others, and some collaborative efforts about some technologies that are already out there and being produced. So I've been working on those types of things kind of quietly behind the scenes. We are also working on our little shop that should be... hopefully we'll have some good news for you on Wednesday of this week, which you'll see.
<br>
<br>We've been working on some new segments for the news, always trying to change things up and keep it new and fresh. And of course, news is all about news for you, so it's all about education on different things that are available, different technologies, a whole new science section maybe. You know, so we're focused on doing positive movements forward while we're trying to make sure we don't have some ridiculous bluebeam or alien ridiculousness going on with these people.
<br>
<br>There's also a few other things we're doing some investigating into because we got some disturbing information yesterday regarding the Middle East. Apparently there are people in Gaza. As you know, they are preventing food supplies from coming in there. The people are surviving, not saying well, but they're surviving there. But they blew up pretty gosh darn much every single hospital and clinic in the area. There are doctors still available and that kind of thing doing, servicing without proper equipment, and that kind of thing. But somebody managed to be diagnosed with polio.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>In Gaza. I think I saw an online about that. Yeah. Yes. They trying to get vaccines over there or something?
<br>
<br>01:33:54
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Absolutely. Pronto. Already allegedly arrived. 1.2 million doses.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Yeah, let's bomb you and then pretend that we want to help you with a vaccine that's probably going to kill you too.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yeah, well, word on the street is there's some vaccine companies that may have donated to continue that war over there or paid some of the Deep State's bills when they couldn't pay. You know, some of the Black Nobility own Bayer and a bunch of other large pharmaceutical companies. So apparently they probably had to try to find a way to get some money out of those companies to support some activities that were going on there we would consider unsavory, on the promise that they could unload about 1.2 million doses of the vaccine.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Well, and then from a media standpoint too, I'm sure there are headlines out there of like, "Oh look! The Israelis, or whatever name you want to put on it, are helping the people of Gaza. "We're going to stop bombing for a little bit or whatever so we can get them these vaccines, and then we'll kill them."
<br>
<br>01:35:00
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>You know, they can't get any food in there. They can't get any water in there. They can't get anything else in there. But you can get 1.2 million vaccine doses in there now, can't you? Yes, you can. And for those of you that don't know, which I will let you know, the polio vaccines that they're producing these days - because we haven't heard about polio anywhere in a long, long time - but the last large distribution of polio vaccines happened in India a few years back, which left about 500,000 people with some kind of disability - a physical disability. Some of them, as far as not being able to walk that are paralyzed now.
<br>
<br>So these are not something you want to do. So if you happen to be in the Gaza Strip and you happen to be watching this, I would highly suggest you run. And I cannot believe they would have the possibility at this moment, based on all of the things that have happened since last October, have the ability to run laboratory tests for a disease that has pretty much been eradicated from planet Earth. You know, that's a very specific test. Why would they have that kind of test on what is left of their hospitals or clinics?
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>It makes no sense. But you know, when they do stupid stuff like that.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>You are flashing like crazy.
<br>
<br>01:36:20
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>They really don't want us talking about this stuff.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>You know what? It reminds me of - you should do this little dance - you remember that movie Flashdance? Do you remember that?
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Oh, I love Flashdance! Where she's got the water coming down on her and the whole, it's all flashing.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yeah, I think so. I don't remember the song, but yeah, you need to get some moves going on to go with your "flash" over there.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>I know, right? Well, when they do stupid stuff like this, I can only hope that more and more people that are just fed up, that are really starting to take a look at these headlines and really trying to put two and two together, that obviously don't watch our news. I think that's the silver lining here; it's that, yes, I know we've all been programmed, some more than others. But there's going to come a point, and more and more people are going to be looking at this stuff and going, "This just doesn't make sense." So on one level, that's kind of the silver lining is that, you know, how many people does this wake up? I don't know. But when they do stupid stuff like this, I mean there are people out there questioning and things aren't adding up. I talked to a lot of people; a lot of Midwesterners when I was traveling over the summer; are asking the right questions. They're just not necessarily connecting all the dots yet, but the more silly that the Deep State gets, the more dots they're going to be able to connect, and at some point there's going to be a breaking point.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yeah.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>So that's a silver lining here guys.
<br>
<br>01:37:52
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>And it's kind of like all the stuff that they're putting out. It's just really? No one's going to figure that one out. Because the people in Gaza wouldn't recognize the fact they can't get some bread, but they can get
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>a vaccine.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yeah, and they're going to need that. And who's paying for that, by the way? Who's shelling out the money for - that's $800 or so $900 per 1.2 [million], that's a lot of money. Did they issue a bond or something? To get those in there? On the promise of one of these big multi-trillion-dollar quadrillion payouts or whatever was going to work out in three days - is that what it's all about? Have they actually been delivered yet? You know, we don't know. We'll see. But, hopefully, hopefully - because we have not confirmed a delivery at this moment - hopefully it doesn't happen; because those things caused a tremendous amount of danger towards the people of India. And matter of fact, after selling them, Bill Gates was actually not allowed in the country of India for a long time. I don't know if he is now. I mean, they're Deep-State to Deep-State over there, Modi and Gates, but yeah.
<br>
<br>01:39:17
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>So I thought there was one vaccine - and I'm not sure if this is true - maybe the details of this - that actually got the real Bill Gates and Melinda Gates killed. I can't remember what country it was.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>In Aruba.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>So that really did happen. The original people were killed because they were killing the people, and the people took control over it. They offed them.
<br>
<br>Because of it.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Well, I know a set for sure of them. It was about four or five years ago. It was actually less than that because it was on the news. So maybe within the last couple of years - died in Aruba.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>A set of Bill and Melinda Gates?
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yeah, a set up them, yeah. They're like salt-and-pepper shakers, you know, there's a set. But yeah, they did, in Aruba. I know that. Bill specifically, by some operatives that were unhappy with some things that he was doing. I'm pretty sure. As far as other sets, I don't know, I don't know for sure. But I don't know how many we have left either. He's into all those eugenics, Nazi-eugenics programs. So God knows how many of them there are in the world.
<br>
<br>01:40:42
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Oh, so you think they're clones, that they're not dopplegangers?
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Well, I don't know about Melinda, but I know about Bill for sure. He's into all those eugenics programs. Everything he puts out. How did he, the guy from the computer company, land on the board of the International Vaccine Committee or whatever it's called? That seems like his area of expertise, doesn't it? No, it does not.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Not at all.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Deep State is Deep State, I guess. He was actually, during the beginning of this lockdown situation we had a few years ago, he was actually given a UN jet to fly around all the countries and all the leaders and every head of state and negotiate deals on COVID vaccine distribution.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Well, he can't afford his own jet? A ton of money, doesn't he?
<br>
<br>01:41:37
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>It's one thing to fly on your own. It's another thing to fly with a UN tail.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Oh, I see.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>UN is very good at giving out what I call "tramp stamps." Meaning, if you're flying in one of their jets, you can go in and out of anywhere, and you're considered diplomatic. And it's diplomatic in the sky, diplomatic in the land, so you can go anywhere you want to go without passports, without anything. You don't need to go through Customs. Of course you wouldn't want someone like that going through customs and actually showing that he went into a country, would you? No, you would not. Especially not for what he was there for - he was offering kickbacks to everybody, which never came either. Just another scam of varying members. Probably he was cannon food at the time, but yeah. Definitely. Probably profited from those old bonds that were issued years before. God knows what Marduk did or orders put out in 1984. This was planned for a long time. So, hopefully none of them will be flying anywhere, and we won't see multiples of them anymore. Very soon. Let's hope that those clones start to break down in the new environment.
<br>
<br>But meanwhile, we've got a lot of work to do on our end.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>You mentioned technologies. Can we have an update on where the neutrino boxes stand? People have been asking about it on our app.
<br>
<br>01:43:13
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>There's a few being tested in a specific country; I'm not going to say where, because they're not in mass production yet. And I have personally not had time to go into an area that's nearby me that I could actually go to and collect materials here. Nor have I come up with the $250,000 I need to build my own lab. So yes, I still have some people that are willing to participate, but I just don't have time to do it all on my own, and I haven't gotten my friend here yet that knows how to do them as well. So we'll see. But I do know they are being tested on a small scale in some remote areas of a country that is not in North America. Let's put it that way.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Okay.
<br>
<br>01:44:03
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>So hopefully, hopefully soon, hopefully before it snows in this particular area, that would be great. I just need to get moving, that's for sure. But right now there's so much going on. You know, there's only one Kim, and we've got the oil loaded up in the one shop. I've got work to do on the other Marketplace thing, even though we have a team that's building it. I still have some stuff that only we can do here. Seller terms and conditions, vendor terms and conditions, things you can't sell, sorry, no firearms and alcohol, and things like that. We don't want to get involved in any of that.
<br>
<br>Checking people's licenses and that kind of stuff. We don't have that kind of capacity at this moment. Not that I'm against anybody who does any of those things. It's just difficult to do online at this moment. Some states you can ship to, some states you can't. It's like CBD. Some states you can ship to, some states you can't. You know, you can't ship to Indiana; you can't ship to Kentucky. I was going through that when I was looking at the oil. So I had to find a different one which does the exact same thing with the exact same terpene as CBD; it's called Copaiba. And Copaiba, you can ship anywhere. So it's a resin that comes from a tree in Brazil that we ended up importing. So yeah, waiting for that to arrive still.
<br>
<br>01:45:29
<br>
<br>But we had to figure out a way around everything. And there are ways to do everything. And once you do the research and you really start looking into it, it's something that does the... It adheres to the same CBD2 receptors in the brain. I've gone through the whole thing. So these are all the things that Kim does with her day that we don't report on the news.
<br>
<br>But we're making it happen bit by bit, piece by piece. We've got some good people, hopefully we'll be able to bring on board once the marketplace is up and running. We've got a lot of people in mind. I'd like to reach out at some point to the people from the Tesla conference that happened that we didn't know anything about. Otherwise, we would have sent somebody there to see what else they have and how we can help their people market their products and go from there. So, we are definitely trying to make this marketplace as robust as we can. It will probably take a little time just like it did with all the other ones to build up, but we will get there and, of course, with all of you. So yep, lots of work though. Doesn't come easy.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Okay, well, thank you, Kim.
<br>
<br>01:46:56
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>That's pretty much it for a Monday. I think that's a lot.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>And that is a lot - a lot of stuff we talked about today.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Have to listen to that one again.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Hopefully we'll see you back here on Wednesday.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Of course.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Okay, see you then.
