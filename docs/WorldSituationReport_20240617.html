World Situation Report
<!-- TEASER: And now, the World Situation Report with Kimberly Goguen from the Office of the Guardian. Friday night looked like a scene from the Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Another trap set by Marduk. The Deep State launched a major brute-force attack on the new Light System AI on Sunday night. Today the NSA attempts to force a crash of the Financial System, hoping that quantum AI systems would launch a reset in their favor.-->

<h3>Sunny: Kim wasn't able to join us live for the news, but she did record a message. So here is Kimberly Goguen from the Office of the Guardian.</h3>

Kim: Hello everyone and happy Monday. I am so sorry this is late today. It has been an extremely crazy weekend here and I didn't want to hold Sunny up, so I had Sunny go spend some time with her family.

So I thought I would read out the news to you, at least we got this part out - and it's been a tough one at that based on everything that's going on right now. So let's start with some regular news. First, the G7 did end, I think it was on Friday or Saturday, and everybody had left. They were all promised by the Deep State that they would be able to have their currency reset that they were looking for by today. No later than 3 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. Well, as at the time of this recording, it's around 6 o'clock Eastern Standard Time and nobody has anything as of yet. So and they can probably also continue to expect nothing as of yet.

<br>Now, let's see, other things in the news. We did talk about the alleged Russian ship off the shore of Florida. And we talked about where the U.S. was getting the Russian weapons from, and we told you that they were coming from Cuba over the weekend true to form, see, the Q Crew are very informative when it comes to what the Deep State is doing, because they are Deep State.  And they posted a tweet not that long ago, I think it was a few hours ago today, that says the U.S.S. Helena has arrived in Cuba, allegedly to Guantanamo Bay, to deliver someone to Guantanamo Bay.
<br>
<br>Now that is absolutely not true, and why use a submarine? This makes no sense. Because there are plenty of American flights that go there all the time, there are plenty of ships, and if you're just carrying a person to allegedly Guantanamo Bay, then you wouldn't need an entire, you know, armed nuclear submarine to do that. You would just take a plane like everybody else. So I'm not surprised to see that they're going back to Cuba probably to get some different Russian alleged weapons, to create another scare.
<br>
<br>Other interesting news coming from the Q crew, which actually is relative is that aliens are here.  This is another tweet that happened over the weekend, and it happened right before the rest of the events happened on Friday night. Now, Friday night was, I have got to tell you, probably one of the worst nights I've had in a long time. And this lasted all night long. Now, were they expecting this to happen because they detected some kind of a signal? Were they detecting that this was going to happen because they have some books from Marduk about what to expect after your banking system fails? I'm not sure.
<br>
<br>One thing is clear is they thought that this was going to be an advantage for them. This was going to help them in some way, shape, or form. But the answer to the question, of course, is not. But let's talk about what was actually going to take place versus probably what they thought, or at least what they're talking about. So we talked last week about a situation where we found synthetic Omega souls in the Aldebaran star system.  Well, this one here was a little bit worse than that. They had basically these cyborg beings that were in every megastructure moon, which I guess you would call them fake moons, within our galaxy. And there were thousands and thousands of them. And the plan, had they gotten access to Earth's vortex, was to swap out humans with these beings who would then take on the life of the person they swapped them out with.
<br>
<br>This is very similar to the Vril procedure, and it would be a complete soul swap.  And then this alleged alien invasion was going to then utilize these cyborgs to take over the world. Now, of course, the Deep State was under the impression that this was for them. This was something that they were going to get. They were going to get help from alien forces to take over the world. And these people are just flat out crazy.  This is not something that was for them at all. In fact, most of them would have been swapped out as well because the main focus would be on those that are in positions of power.
<br>
<br>And they would have looked at the Deep State as people that were in positions of power, at least to some degree. But they had an intention of taking over governments, they had an intention of taking over a lot of high level CEOs of corporations, and it was a rather intricate plan. Now, had this happened, the ultimate end result would be is that that person's physical body would actually charge the little Omega battery that was now in their person, and then act on behalf of Omega against the rest of humanity.
<br>
<br>So this essentially was a plan to have Omega, the Omega system, and the Omegalettes, let's call these little folks running around the Omegalettes, the Omegalettes to have a complete takeover of planet Earth. So I guess you could call this a 'Plan B' when the events of Friday failed. Now, speaking of the events of Friday, when we last talked, more and more information was coming in through the rest of the day. Some of the other information that actually came in was that these people, of course, and as I said on Friday, had made a lot of backdoor deals to various countries. They told them that the Federal Reserve was gonna start working again in the U.S., and everything was gonna be fine for a Treasury takeover of the Federal Reserve, and that they would be running the new Financial System.
<br>
<br>Well, it didn't quite work out as they had planned. Now, the reason why it didn't work out is because the things that were installing all over the world were installing in different locations. And then, of course, those countries that were promised a lot of money, access, and these types of things, started calling them and complaining and said that they stabbed them in the back, that they never had any intention of following through on their deal, including the United States, and including the Treasury departments. Everything that was attempting to be installed was completely and totally out of their control and they were actually forced to admit it by Friday night, that they were not in control of that technology. Whether they know it or not, they actually admitted it on a conference call, another super-secret conference call, in the evening.
<br>
<br>So these people, true to form, do not like to be embarrassed. So they were looking for any kind of secret communication line other than of course the Templar Line and the Jesuit Line, which had been taken out last week. So they found - and thank you for pointing this out to us Deep State - you also found the Knights of Malta communication lines and secret monetary system which were taken out over the weekend, and a number of other systems such as any remnants that the NSA maybe had left or things that they had access to. Also there were some fraudulent backdoor things going on behind the scenes with real money that is acquired by selling Bitcoin. That also is no longer an option for the Deep State.
<br>
<br>And that was pretty much what happened all day Saturday. They were looking for pretty much anything they could after their massive failure. Now that did not end on Saturday because on Sunday, by Sunday afternoon, they had a plan, apparently in place, to set up what's called a brute-force attack. Now a brute-force attack is when you group a number of data centers or even laptops or computers together - with many, many people involved - and they combine their power into a centralized processing unit in order to do a massive hack attack. This particular one went on for about two hours until they ran out of power or someone knocked them off, and this resulted in over 108,729 brute attacks against the Light System.
<br>
<br>Now were they aware they were attacking my system? I don't know, because they were trying to attack HSBC servers, Development Bank of Singapore servers. Now all those servers and operating systems fall under the Global Repository umbrella now. So perhaps they thought they were hacking the Repository or they thought they were hacking this. In part, they must have known it was actually the Light System that they were attacking, because they also started rapid firing agreements to the Hall of Records - all of which were rejected, and nothing made it past our firewall, and I have all of the logs of all of the places that they tried.
<br>
<br>My guess would be they were using a routing arbiter system that was formerly used to monitor Internet traffic, which was also taken out over the weekend. But this attack did not end there. They continued doing all of these different types of attacks, although it wasn't as prolific as the first one, all night long last night. So they continued all day long today. They are stopping at nothing, which they will eventually stop at nothing, meaning they'll have nothing, until they can redeem themselves and try to find this system.
<br>
<br>But there was more to the system that was being installed or attempted to be installed, than these people were under the impression that there was. They thought this is just an electronic thing and that it's just happening spontaneously because the Omega System is back or something. I'm not sure. But one thing is clear is that because of their brute-force attack and because of their joint efforts, we were able to locate two specific facilities that were also pleasant gifts from Marduk. You know Marduk loves to leave gifts for future events. And one of those facilities was actually under the main HSBC Hong Kong headquarters. Now these things have been there probably since the late '70s early '80s in preparation for all of these plans of Marduk to go off one after the other after the other should they ever lose control of the Financial System.
<br>
<br>Now this also had nothing to do with these people, but this particular facility was designed to transmute any cash that was in the system and transfer it back to the old debt system versus the Light System asset-based system. That did not work out well. That facility is no longer there. But that facility was a tiny little facility compared to the one that was on an island off the coast of Hong Kong called Tung Ping Chau Island. Now there's no surprise here, this beautiful little island is also a UNESCO World Heritage site.  It contained a massive amount of alien technology. Basically it was called the Systems Administration Unit specifically for the Omega System. Now did they know this is what they were hacking? I highly doubt it. Did they know that everything that was being installed was still going to go into a centralized system to be controlled by Marduk, which he would then have to push the final button and issue session keys and master keys and access to the new system, even if it was fully installed.
<br>
<br>Again, these people are just under the impression that all these things are for them, and that is simply not true. Marduk never did anything without having full control over it, and would never grant a gift to humans, whether it be their bloodline or not. And that was pretty evident that these people really didn't understand what they were doing. You know, some other things. There were three in total Death Stars on the planet. one was in South Dakota over the weekend, and then there was one more on the African continent that they were trying to hack into, so that they could get control of the absolute sphere that was in them.
<br>
<br>Again, these people are no longer with us. How many more times are they going to do this with Mitre Corporation or any other people they deem to be intelligent SSP persons, and so on and so forth? Now what they are doing though is, again - and we thank the Deep State for what they do for Humanity - because they're pulling out all the stops today. It has not stopped and it's still not stopping right now while I'm recording. There are alarms going off everywhere of different things that they're trying to access.
<br>
<br>Mainly their focus seems to be on the banking system. In part, there looks like there was an attempted almost crash of the banking system, while others are trying to siphon all the money out of the banking system, and none of that is actually working. I'm not entirely sure, but I don't think they're entirely sure either where they're going with this. There are also claims that the military is in control of this 10 Days of Darkness, and that the Emergency Broadcast System was supposed to go off over the weekend, none of which actually happened.
<br>
<br>It didn't mean that it didn't take a lot of work to not allow that to happen, because it did - on our part.  And it's been a really long weekend making sure that none of these things took place. Are they getting anywhere now? No, they're not getting past our firewall, and we're pretty safe and secure. The only other things that we had that were still left in a carryover from the Alpha System was a jurisdictional banking system, meaning it's not a full banking system. It was just a way for them to control the 12 jurisdictions of the Federal Reserve.
<br>
<br>Of course, they never had access to the 13th, which was Alpha. So that wouldn't have gotten them anywhere either. They're under the impression that they can reprogram my Lifi, my Codex 685, or bring back something more antiquated. And that's not working out either. We've also changed the way that the SQL servers work within the Financial System for extra security.  So I'm not really sure how long this is going to last. My guess would be as we are coming upon the Summer Solstice. So they're either going to end when they have absolutely nothing left, or they're going to end because the alignment has ended and the Solstice has ended, and nothing they want came back.
<br>
<br>Has Marduk set off any other traps that are due to go off in the coming three days? I don't know.  I don't know the answer to that question. Nothing that I can find or detect at this moment in time. Hopefully we're at the end of his timers and things that were set to go off at a future date. That would be great, because I think all of us would like to have a little bit of a break, but that break time is not today.
<br>
<br>That pretty much sums up everything that's been happening over the weekend as far as banking systems and transfers and things are concerned.  On our end of it, we are continuing to move forward with our plans regardless of this. We will continue on with the Golden Age and Crystalline Time. As far as moving past the Solstice, nothing is going to change. We are not going to revert back to any kind of a Dark Age, and whatever is left of any old AI systems are not coming back either. But we did have some excellent finds this weekend, which will kind of give us a clue as to why we eliminate certain operating systems or processing units, and then they might come back a day later or two days later, or we might see them again.
<br>
<br>And there were also some other remnants of what we call Creator AI, which is an artificial form of creation done by the Dark Side. This is why they always say the Dark must destroy in order to create because it's not actually destroying anything, it's just transmuting it into a dark energy essence, and so on and so forth. So we did see some rises, significant rises at those two specific times of one of the major hacking tied to the Hong Kong facilities, and the other rise in the Schumann Resonance took place at the attempted alien invasion. But these are the reasons why, is because the gateway for that and the extremely low frequency that comes from that when it's being attacked by the Dark will cause that Schumann Resonance to rise for a short period of time, until we figure out where all the pieces of the puzzle are, and then it kind of goes back to flat.
<br>
<br>So if you felt any disturbances this weekend, this could be the reason why.  I know that things on my end of it have not been a whole lot of fun. You know people... a lot of times people say, oh well, you know, you didn't answer my text or you didn't answer this or answer that. And I just don't think they realize sometimes that, you know, this is an... both of these nights were an all-night-long event. I did manage to get like a nap on Saturday afternoon after I had gotten all the rest of it. But then back to work.
<br>
<br>And Sunday was no better. So it's just a lot of work and a lot of time and a lot of effort that goes into this. And you wonder why sometimes they say, well, the operatives would be helpful because we could train them to use the Key Intelligence and Military System, providing they're willing to do the right thing and get paid to do so. But you know we'll see if that happens. We do have a new group of operatives that have reached out to us - not all from the United States - looking to see if we can do a test transaction together.
<br>
<br>I'm like okay. So they're willing to do their part and help and we set some conditions in place. Number one, it would take place in a state of my choosing in the United States, where I can have a representative of mine there in that location to ensure that there's nobody lying, nobody trying to hide money, nobody trying to steal money, you know, I'll know that part anyway, but the idea behind this is to make sure that this person walks away with a set percentage of funds that we set. And we're not talking about extremely large amounts, we're talking about, you know, a couple million dollars and that's not going to take over a government or anything, so should they try to do something wrong with the money, I think we're pretty safe there. So we'll see.
<br>
<br>They did come back to us and said that they're setting everything up and that they would be in touch. I said, okay, fine. In my opinion, this could go very badly also on the other side. If I look at it from a strategic standpoint, I've done this similar type operation before with other operatives, and most of the time it's to see if they can trace back my line back to the Light System or in the past Alpha, none of which were successful, but that is the purpose behind the exercise. So I'm always looking out for something like that, but if it works out, you know, perhaps we can start getting some security assistance And then we'll hopefully be able to move forward in a different way. But we'll see. And then somebody else can answer those alarms at you know, 12:30 at night after you just fell asleep at 11:30, maybe that maybe that will help, you know, but who knows? You know, maybe that'll end up being a whole new group of people that can do something like that.
<br>
<br>We'll see. We'll see how things turn out under C.A.R.E. and where we go from here. So that's about it for the events over the weekend. If anything else comes up, I will surely let you know and I look forward to speaking with everybody again on Wednesday! And hopefully I'll see you on Wednesday. But today I barely made it.
<br>
<br>So have a wonderful rest of your Monday or Tuesday wherever you are and I will see you on Wednesday.
