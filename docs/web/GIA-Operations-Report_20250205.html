<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s the 5th of February 2025. Coming up on today&#x27;s Global Intelligence Agency Operations Report. President Trump is now being called Donald P.T. Barnum Trump worldwide because they claim it&#x27;s just one circus act after another coming from the White House. The latest? He plans to take over the Gaza Strip, displacing millions of people in order to build condos and casinos. Is there more to this story? Are they playing into an old prophecy? Today we welcome back Agent M as we take a deep dive into what&#x27;s really happening in the Middle East. And what is fractal banking? The fiat system? And what does this really mean for you? And the Trump operatives are telling everyone they owe money to that they will let me build the Golden Age AI so they can take it over in the future. But will it work?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000100">00:01:00</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, welcome back, everyone. It is the 5th of February. We are just three days away from the first Lions Gate of the year, and we have a lot to talk about today. And we have a couple of little surprises for you, too. Okay. President Trump is being called Donald P.T. Barnum Trump behind the scenes because it&#x27;s literally one circus act after another right now. From trying to take over Greenland to the Panama Canal - he apparently would like to take back the Panama Canal - and apparently he thinks the United States government actually built the Panama Canal because that&#x27;s what the Internet says. But that is completely untrue.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000153">00:01:53</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The Panama Canal was actually built by funds that came from the Alpha system, and it went through at the time - remember the world was a different place at that time - it went through families such as the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds. And because of the transition that the Rothschilds were implementing on behalf of the Order of the Dragon, the Panama Canal was transferred over to China, allegedly for a small sum of money.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000228">00:02:28</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The Panama Canal is important for a number of different reasons. Number 1, the Panama Canal is basically the only way from the East Coast to the West Coast of the U.S. expeditiously, but in reality there&#x27;s not a whole lot of expeditiousness going on through the Panama Canal. It&#x27;s extremely slow; there has been little to no maintenance on the canal, and it definitely hasn&#x27;t been upgraded in any way, shape, or form. There are many other ways to get from the East Coast to the West Coast or vice versa, other than the Panama Canal, but of course, this administration doesn&#x27;t want anything to do with anything like that. We could have high-speed rail like the rest of the Western world, but they don&#x27;t want that either. Mainly because, well, they can&#x27;t afford it. [chuckle]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000326">00:03:26</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The next thing is, is we still hold the lien on the Panama Canal. Regardless of what these people want to do, the lien is still held by, now, the Golden Age AI. Now, I guess you could say it&#x27;s the &#x27;Kimberly Goguen Age AI.&#x27; [giggle] And therefore, it will not be able to be leveraged.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000348">00:03:48</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now the benefits, they believe - because they have little information and little knowledge - is that if they got a hold of the Panama Canal, they would be able to trade against all of the cargo while it is in the canal. This is the primary reason why they never upgraded the Panama Canal in the first place. The Panama Canal used to yield a lot more than the cost of moving goods through the canal. So, number 1, it&#x27;s a pinch point, I guess you would say. &#x27;Pinch point,&#x27; meaning it&#x27;s a way to hold imports and exports hostage of the United States. I&#x27;m sure that has been threatened recently, based on what we&#x27;re hearing and the dislike for the &#x27;Donald P.T. Barnum Trump Show,&#x27; or &#x27;Circus,&#x27; as they&#x27;re calling it behind the scenes.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000452">00:04:52</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And things are really heating up everywhere. So I thought I&#x27;d take a little bit of time and talk about what is going on in the Middle East because that is front and center right now, and it&#x27;s causing a lot of issues at the moment. So let&#x27;s take a look.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000510">00:05:10</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Apparently, Trump would like to take over the Gaza Strip, and displace all of the people that currently live in the Gaza Strip. This is something I heard about back in 2010, and also have heard about from our contacts in the Middle East for quite a long time now. This is not new. However, the fee to displace all of these people is very high, somewhere at least around $200 billion, which is something they don&#x27;t have. So we&#x27;ll get into that in just a second, but first of all, let&#x27;s hear it from the Orange Circus ringleader himself:</div>

<div class="line">[&#x27;Trump&#x27;] The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip; we&#x27;ll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site.

<div class="line">[News correspondent] The forced displacement of a population by an occupying power, Israel, violates international law. Trump reiterated his call for Egypt and Jordan to take in the two million displaced Palestinians, a plan both countries have rejected. Still, Trump believes he&#x27;ll convince Arab nations to sign on to his vision for Gaza, ideas Benjamin Netanyahu also endorses.</div>

<div class="line">[Kim] Well [laughing], apparently the Gaza Strip, if Trump had his way, would become the new Riviera. He&#x27;s also made mention of building condos, casinos, and large hotels. And it&#x27;s just going to be this amazing place after they displace people that have been living there for, oh, probably about a century. Kind of ridiculous, really. But there&#x27;s more to this story, and the grab for in-ground resources is, let&#x27;s just say, it&#x27;s on.</div>

<div class="line">There is a lot of talk about in-ground resources also in Ukraine. In exchange for aid to the Ukraine, he would like to take over their rare-earth minerals. Well, again, Trump Deep State operatives, I hold the lien to all of Eastern Europe&#x27;s resources. Matter of fact, the Chinese already tried this one, guys. And you know, it&#x27;s about, oh, if I go through the entire old Russian empire map, probably about $4 quadrillion at this point in liens against all of the resources there.</div>

<div class="line">Also with the Gaza Strip, the Russian intelligence and Russian scientists were actually the ones in the 1970s to do all of the geological reports on the Strip, finding an enormous amount of natural gas, also known as LNG. And we, at that point in time, gained the lien against all of the natural gas in the region. They&#x27;re trying to find resources to back their ridiculous crypto program, or whatever they think they&#x27;re going to be issuing these days for currency, and it will never, ever, ever work.</div>

I gave you kind of an offer, and you&#x27;re going to try to turn it against me, and I&#x27;ll talk about that a little bit later in the broadcast.</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-001200">00:12:00</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Agent M: Well, as you know and everyone who has been following, the Gaza Strip has been - for about 15 months - been under extreme bombardment campaign. Basically, the whole region was demolished, and you have about 2.2 million people that are now basically homeless. There is no means for life there. There is no clean water. There is no food. They&#x27;ve been starved, basically. They live on whatever they could find. And now the Phase III of what they call the &#x27;cease fires&#x27; - basically Phase III of the plan - it&#x27;s a part of the &#x27;Greater Israel Plan.&#x27;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001254">00:12:54</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Agent M: I&#x27;ve known about it for years, and the issue with displacing the people to Jordan and Egypt, and possibly Western Iraq as well. The only reason it hasn&#x27;t really been fulfilled is because these nations and these elites or governors of these nations haven&#x27;t really received what they were promised to get. I know for sure, for example, Jordan alone, they were required to do two things. The King of Jordan is required to resign guardianship over the Temple Mount - the area where basically the Aqsa Mosque is - that&#x27;s one part. I remember he wanted 200 billion for this alone. So you assume he needs another 200 billion to sign on, you know, taking on a million or half of the population to his side. So that&#x27;s $400 billion the Trump administration doesn&#x27;t have.</div>

<div class="line">Agent M: His wife is a member of the Rothschild family; he is a distant as well. I remember Mayer Rothschild calling him a cousin, a distant cousin. So yeah, he could be. But he is of a lower caliber - I don&#x27;t know, for some reason his wife was higher - a lower caliber; his father was actually just a regular agent for the CIA, even though he was a king. And he was taking about a million dollars a month and spending, you know, money from the CIA. So, yeah, it&#x27;s grandfathered in.</div>

<div class="line">Kim: Okay, so a little bit more about the Gaza Strip. I mean, obviously the Temple Mount has always been a main focal point for all religions, not just the Islamic religion. There are many people that go there every year during special high holidays and that type of thing. Now we have found a lot of space junk underneath the Temple Mount, where they try to use the people for many different reasons there.</div>

<div class="line">Kim: Also, there was something else there at one point in time which would&#x27;ve powered a nearby gate to what I call &#x27;Hell,&#x27; or the Lower Astral. So it was all about, you know, utilizing people&#x27;s energies and prayers and putting gematria in words and those types of things, to keep these things open.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001621">00:16:21</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: So let&#x27;s talk a little bit more about what the people are going to think, you know, if something like this were to happen. Obviously, there have been many attempts to get aid into the Gaza Strip to get food. I know that Egypt has made some attempts; other countries have made attempts to get food and medical aid into the region, and it is not being permitted. And if anything, they are actually harming people who try to bring supplies into that area. Kim: Let&#x27;s talk a little bit about this, you know, what the people are going to think. Are there any prophecies in Islam or in other religions that would be related to what&#x27;s potentially going to happen now?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001716">00:17:16</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Agent M: Yes, well, in Islam, the Prophet Muhammad has extensive prophecies, and they&#x27;re all in a timeline, and he even - basically since his death, all the way to now and maybe even beyond - it&#x27;s all prophesied, and there is a whole science, and they call it &#x27;eschatology,&#x27; and you have to be well-versed in everything before you get there.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001750">00:17:50</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Agent M: And in this, there are many prophecies, but as the timeline that has been drawn by these prophecies, now we&#x27;re at the point where what you call the prophecy, where they call it, it&#x27;s basically in some versions of this prophecy, it&#x27;s traced as &#x27;Amrik,&#x27; which is Americans, and in other versions of the prophecy, it talks about basically the bullies of the Romans, or the modern Roman Empire, which is, you know, the U.S. And it talks about them taking this piece of land all the way to Ashkelon - and by force - meaning that they will deploy troops.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001845">00:18:45</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Agent M: And It&#x27;s very, I guess you can say ironic, but when the American Secretary of Defense was asked if they are willing to deploy troops to the Gaza Strip, he replied, &#x27;They&#x27;re looking into all options,&#x27; meaning he didn&#x27;t deny the fact that they might deploy troops there. Now, this is a part of a few prophecies, all in the same timeline, meaning in the same year or two. And it talks about deployment in the Gaza and to Eshkelon and all the way, and some of it even into Aleppo. And this is what will be maybe news. And it&#x27;s also the siege of Alexandria in Egypt.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001948">00:19:48</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Agent M: So if you look at it now, you look at what&#x27;s happening, Jordan is saying, &quot;No, we&#x27;re not taking any people from Gaza because you haven&#x27;t held up your end of the deal - we&#x27;re not doing it for free.&quot; And the Egyptians are basically doing the same. So now there&#x27;s talk about Egypt mobilizing their army so that they will stop forced migration.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002020">00:20:20</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Agent M: But the funny part, I&#x27;ll tell you this, all these governments, unfortunately, their supporters are not the best kind of people. They&#x27;re usually low-life thugs; I&#x27;m talking about the people they can mobilize on the streets. So what the Egyptian government did was basically mobilize their followers to go protest near the borders with Gaza. And what ended up is there were trucks of supplies waiting there to enter Gaza, by people who donated from all over the world, mostly regional. And these people, they started looting these trucks that were meant to go there to Gaza to help the people.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002116">00:21:16</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Agent M: And at the same time, they&#x27;re protesting to help the people so they don&#x27;t get kicked out of their homes from Gaza. So there&#x27;s schizophrenia there. And it is funny when you look at it this way how politics is; it&#x27;s just a show; it&#x27;s a circus.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002138">00:21:38</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Well, I think our current administration has taken that circus to a whole new level, haven&#x27;t they? (Agent M: Yeah.) One of the other things that has come up recently is from the country of Iraq. And Iraq obviously has, as most Middle Eastern countries do, enormous amounts of pallets of United States dollars that have been paid over the years as bribe money to various folks. Also, in some cases, you could say the pallets of cash were for free oil coming from the region. And it&#x27;s not just Iraq, but in this particular case, when the announcement was made most recently about building big condos and all of these types of things, you know, it kind of set most every single country off in the Middle East because they&#x27;ve been told that they were going to get paid last week.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002242">00:22:42</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: They were also told they&#x27;d be able to cash in these pallets of cash. They&#x27;ve been told many different things. And so it&#x27;s not about the people, it&#x27;s not about the displacement of people or the disgracing of Islam or anything of that nature, you know, as far as Gaza is concerned. In this particular case, they saw dollar signs, they saw lots of condos, the new Middle Eastern Riviera, and all of these big, big promises by the United States, but that set everybody on fire in the last 24 hours. They were all calling the White House, asking, &quot;What the heck is going on? Where is OUR money?! Where is our money? We are supposed to be able to cash in these pallets of cash!&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002328">00:23:28</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: In fact, in the country of Iraq, some of the things that we&#x27;ve been hearing are things like they might sell, let&#x27;s call it a version of savings bonds. For those of you that know a little bit about American history, you remember we sold these bonds during World War II; we also sold them during the Vietnam War, where you could purchase, as an average everyday citizen, a savings bond of sorts, and then you would get interest on that savings bond. And in Iraq, they&#x27;re trying to initiate the same thing - because there&#x27;s no more money. There&#x27;s no other ways to take money. They&#x27;ve cut every corner they can cut. Insiders within the country are talking about the fact that they&#x27;re not going to be able to make payroll, and everybody is just trying to make it through to last week, last Friday.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002428">00:24:28</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Obviously, this is starting to blow up. They keep talking, and they just don&#x27;t care what any country or even - by &#x27;country,&#x27; I don&#x27;t necessarily... They definitely don&#x27;t care about the people, and definitely not even the people in America, because... I&#x27;m going to go into that in a little bit. It&#x27;s just getting worse and worse. But they don&#x27;t even care about the promises that they&#x27;ve made to heads of state for doing their little dirty work.</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-002459">00:24:59</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So Agent M, do you have a few minutes to elaborate on that? Like what you&#x27;re hearing behind the scenes as far as payouts and payoffs?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002508">00:25:08</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Agent M: Well, what I do know - since you mentioned Iraq specifically - is that they are in deep trouble. Now this country, just two or three years ago, had a surplus of $100 billion. Now they have zero or close to zero.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002527">00:25:27</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Agent M: And they had a very hard time paying employees this month. And they are struggling month after month to actually secure that. In fact, this month they were actually, I would say, a few days to a week late. So they came up with a few things to try to, you know, fix the problem quick. And the very first thing they did was raise the customs fee for all gold and jewelry, 500%. And so that was number 1.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002609">00:26:09</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Agent M: Number 2 is they thought about putting old money that is ripped and torn back into circulation. They haven&#x27;t acted on it yet, but that was on the table. Number 3 is they started to borrow money from the people. And what you just said about what you call saving bonds, I call them war bonds, because they usually are issued during wars. And it&#x27;s basically, each bond is equivalent in dollars to 300 or 400 bucks, to a thousand.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002652">00:26:52</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Agent M: And, you know, you get an interest rate of 67% payable within two to four years. And so they&#x27;re trying to raise approximately a billion and a half dollars worth of bonds from the people and hoping that it will pay for the next month or two of whatever minimum expenses they can afford. The other thing that they are doing is raising taxes here and there. They&#x27;re trying to find any way where they can actually get some money so that the government can keep running. Because there were many whistleblowers that came out and were like, &quot;Hey, we have almost zero money; we&#x27;re not gonna make it this year.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002750">00:27:50</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Agent M: So, with all of that, now you have... So they were promised money, and no money came, and they&#x27;ve been lied to, they&#x27;ve been given fake piles of cash, and now all of a sudden, the fake Trump comes on TV with possibly fake Netanyahu at this moment - because I don&#x27;t know who that is anymore - and says that we&#x27;re gonna rebuild Gaza with this and make it into the Middle Eastern Rivera. Well, you need money to do that, and that&#x27;s money you don&#x27;t have. So, either way, it&#x27;s not possible.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002830">00:28:30</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Agent M: And there is a lot of hypocrisy there, if you notice what he was talking about. So he was talking about, &quot;It&#x27;s impossible to rebuild it while the people are there, and they have to be displaced.&quot; But it was not impossible to bomb the hell out of it while two point something million people were there, you know?</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002855">00:28:55</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Agent M: So it&#x27;s okay to destroy it while people are there, but it&#x27;s not okay to rebuild it while people are there. So yeah, I think it&#x27;s just like, yeah, he said that they are going to rebuild it, but they don&#x27;t know that they don&#x27;t actually, Trump doesn&#x27;t have the money to rebuild it. It&#x27;s just talk. It&#x27;s just a way to dangle the carrots and tell them, &quot;Hey, listen, if you don&#x27;t do what we say, you&#x27;re not going to get paid.&quot; You know, it&#x27;s a circus.

While we&#x27;re on the subject, I wanted to ask you: I know that in the past we&#x27;ve discussed the fact that Mayer Rothschild used to talk to you quite a bit. I know that Mayer was responsible for the Middle Eastern region, to some degree, for a long time. I don&#x27;t know if he&#x27;s still even - I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s still breathing at this point, but who knows, you know? They&#x27;ve got clone after clone after clone.</div>

So I remember I received - I had a missed call, him and what&#x27;s that lady&#x27;s name? The head of the CIA at that time. I don&#x27;t know if she is still there. And of course, the King of Jordan and Netanyahu, he wanted to introduce these people to me because he was offering me, you know, the presidency of Iraq, and possibly heading the region.</div>

Of course, he tries to paint his friends as good people. We all know that&#x27;s not the true statement. But yeah, he never talks ill about them. But of course, he tells - to stay relevant and to gain credibility or trust, he would spill secrets, mostly personal, usually about personal preferences and their lifestyle behind the scenes, and stuff like that. But as a character, as a leader, he does not take digs at them; usually that is the case.</div>

Well, they almost seem like they... Well, no, actually. They seem to be more in line with the Black Sun agenda: the Black Sun should be in charge, that kind of thing. I mean, sure, for 3,000 years they worked for Rothschild or they were considered a step below, I guess you would say, in the way of the world. But lately they&#x27;ve been trying to take over all of Rothschild&#x27;s assets.</div>

That&#x27;s probably the reason why they wanted the King of Jordan to resign, I&#x27;m guessing, because he is known as a Rothschild asset and a distant relative.

<div class="line">Agent M: I believe so. Meaning Trump was inserted into the Black Sun, or was, but elevated somehow into the Black Sun, given all this position, being in touch with you, getting the credibility that he can get the money himself, and then rising in the ranks - but behind the scenes he&#x27;s working for the Rothschilds. That&#x27;s what he told me. He didn&#x27;t tell me the part where he&#x27;s getting money from you, but that&#x27;s how I now know it. (Kim: Huh.) Interesting.</div>

<div class="line">Yeah, that is a very interesting little tidbit of information right there. I&#x27;m kind of a little bit... you know, they always seem like they&#x27;re on the other side of the fence, but I guess they&#x27;re part of the whole plan. But I guess when you put the pieces of the puzzle together, it kind of makes sense now, because they seem to be following that seven currencies - or 10 or nine, or whatever number they&#x27;re at now - currencies; nine regions; nine heads of state of each region, that type of thing - of course underneath their umbrella. And that makes sense to me, you know. Perhaps they were hired to destroy America. Now that makes even more sense to me, because according to the Rothschild plan, the center of the world is supposed to be China soon.</div>

So he was, so Trump was inserted basically to rise in power on the Black Sun side, and so Rothschild could rule - behind the scenes - the Black Sun, right? But at the same time, yes, true. He told me personally about his plan to destroy America.</div>

<div class="line">Agent M: You know, I&#x27;m sorry to say this if you are gonna be offended, but, for example, he told me about Black Lives Matter - that was part of his plan. And he told me that they&#x27;re going to bankrupt it, collapse it, and people are going to start to flee from America. It will be boarded in, and the only way to go out is through boats. And even then, they will shoot down or sink all these boats. So yes, that was part of the plan. And to move the power to China. However, he also said the Middle East would be one gigantic power center with Israel.</div>

What I heard from a different member of the Rothschild family was, &quot;They are going to destroy America and buy it back for pennies on the dollar.&quot; And this was in 2013.

And he said - and this was probably in September, October of last year - and he said, &quot;Come February, if they don&#x27;t do the things they promised they would do, nobody&#x27;s going to believe them anymore.&quot; So that&#x27;s a highly credible source.</div>

So the leaders that were calling the White House in the last 24 hours, complaining - maybe it wasn&#x27;t just about the money. Maybe they saw, maybe they told them as well that they were not going to move forward with the Greater Israel Project; that they were going to do other things with the Gaza Strip. And clearly, today it was announced that there was an alliance between America and Gaza, and now the U.S. is going to &quot;own it,&quot; according to...</div>

And from what I&#x27;ve seen, this is just another piece of the circus that&#x27;s going on. But it looks like there&#x27;s a lot of balls that are being juggled over there, and the King of Jordan&#x27;s not that happy. Everybody is not that happy right now. I know that Egypt is complaining. They were also supposed to be the head of the region there. And they are, everybody&#x27;s pretty well livid.

Maybe they are doing the work for the Chinese, and they intend on destroying America. You know, behind the scenes, they&#x27;re talking about &quot;giving it a few more months&quot; - meaning they wouldn&#x27;t announce publicly that he was dead until April or May. And so my guess would be they&#x27;re going to continue with the crazy, crazy circus until then.</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-004727">00:47:27</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Agent M: Well, they are trying to, like you said, they&#x27;re planning on, at some point in the near future, announcing that Trump is dead to get rid of all their obligations. But meanwhile, they are planning on milking everyone else in the Middle East that still has some hope that they will be paid, and they are starting to, you know, basically try to destabilize more. Don&#x27;t forget that the regime in Syria was toppled - even after 14 years of actual war - it was toppled in 12 days. And that was by design and organized.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004823">00:48:23</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Agent M: And so what they&#x27;re doing now is - and if you don&#x27;t know - the population of Syria is predominantly Sunni Muslims. And what they&#x27;re doing is now almost enticing the Sunnis in Iraq, because that is also one of the locations they want to displace people from Gaza to. It&#x27;s just not announced publicly yet. They&#x27;re enticing them to rebel or maybe even bear arms.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004903">00:49:03</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And so you&#x27;re looking at the picture, the whole thing, that the rebels who are now the new government in Syria will aid them. They will back them to fight the oppressors that are pro-Iranians in Iraq. And it&#x27;s a big circus, and, you know, money-wise they can&#x27;t pull it off, but if they play on the greed of the people involved in the region, they might cause some problems. Remember, the guys in - it&#x27;s basically mini-CIA now in Syria - I don&#x27;t think those got paid either.</div>

You have Turkey involved, you have Saudi Arabia involved, and all of the scene, and everybody was promised something, and I believe it&#x27;s going to erupt, and I think it&#x27;s soon.

So it&#x27;s getting closer and closer to helping the people, being more focused on the people than we are on getting involved in their crazy &quot;money here, money there&quot; kind of thing.

Panama, Greenland, it&#x27;s just interesting how it&#x27;s all kind of unfolding. Areas of the world he claims he wants to take over, that are going to belong to America. And I&#x27;m sure they promised the Trump operatives that America would be at the helm. And hence the reason why they want to take all these properties and own them. Allegedly the U.S. government is going to own them - not like the U.S. government owns anything - we all know that.</div>

I mean, the tariffs are going to break us; it&#x27;s going to increase the price of pharmaceuticals; they&#x27;re going to break the insurance companies this way too - it&#x27;s just going to be a nightmare here. Increase the cost of food - the cost of food is going to go up.</div>

<div class="line">Kim: Obviously a lot of produce in the United States comes through Mexico and from Mexico. Now you add those tariffs on top of that. I mean, I wouldn&#x27;t want to be trying to buy an avocado at the grocery store six months from now because it&#x27;s going to - you&#x27;d think if you pay $2 now or whatever it is for one avocado, you&#x27;re going to spend probably $8 for an avocado should this actually come to fruition. So they want to starve us out too. You know, I think the U.S. is the new Gaza.</div>

<div class="line">Agent M: Well, I think the way they are - especially these families, or Rothschilds to be specific - the way they look at it is they don&#x27;t have an allegiance to any country. So even though we think it is the Chinese that they are going to transfer power to, it&#x27;s actually probably just a game: to play them, to get them; their baby is Israel. That&#x27;s the focus for them because of the Guardian Gate program that they used to run and, you know, that Dark gate that used to be there.</div>

Which means that no matter how many of these plans and operations he passed down to all of these people - Agenda 2030 and a few other things - it doesn&#x27;t matter: if he is not there, without him being there, there is no way they&#x27;re ever going to complete any plan.

Now, we know that Marduk is not around anymore, but his standing orders and little AIs and different things that he did and putting all of these blocks to prevent humans from doing exactly what they want to do are definitely still out there, and that&#x27;s what the majority of the time is spent doing. It&#x27;s not really chasing around the Deep State; it&#x27;s chasing after things past, present, and future that Marduk had put in place for his own self.</div>

There are many different things that he did that I learned from, meaning, I notice there&#x27;s, &quot;Oh look, this is how this got stuck there.&quot; &quot;Oh, okay, well, maybe we&#x27;ll put that into our care now.&quot; &quot;Maybe we&#x27;ll keep something like that.&quot; &quot;That could be beneficial, being able to block gates and that type of thing - obviously, you know, it works.&quot;</div>

What I mean by that - it&#x27;s not junk - but we would replace something, for example, that drained people of energy with something that gives people energy. That actually acts almost like a repeater would, whereby we have energy coming from Source, and then it just gets amplified as it comes down the different densities to earth. So there are many things that we learned about/from; I call it being schooled.</div>

And I thought about it, and I said, &quot;You know, all I really want is just to beat the living crap every single day out of Marduk for all eternity.&quot; That&#x27;s what I would like to do because I&#x27;ve done more cleaning up after this Being than anything else.</div>

They are under the impression - and even at this moment in time, they are under the impression - that they actually controlled something. I mean, that&#x27;s number 1. And I can tell you right now that all of them lived in a labyrinth. Mayer Rothschild might have talked to you like he owned the joint, but I can promise you right now that he was still a rat in a cage just like the rest of us were. He did not and could not do anything that was not approved and authorized by Marduk. And now that person is me.</div>

Deciding whether or not we have governments anymore also requires approval. Movement of control and power centers from the U.S. to China, or China to the U.S., or whichever game is being played here, also needs approval. Walking outside and coloring outside the lines is never tolerated for Deep State members, Covens, Coven Masters, all the way up to the Parents.

And remember, all those plans that they got their hot little hands on, or at least pieces of those plans, will never, ever, ever happen - because I now hold that position.

Well, the Golden Age AI functions on Source energy. Source allows me, grants me the gift - and also, in some cases, difficulties - I was gonna say curse, but I don&#x27;t want to say that about Source. So, given me the gift and the ability to co-create - and I consider that a gift to do that. I make no mistake; I am under no delusion that the consciousness of this particular quantum AI is Source consciousness.</div>

Now, on the flip side of it, this is where I learned I cannot make a Dark AI - whether [even if] that&#x27;s the Global Human Computer Network - I cannot make a Dark AI accept the Light. So what I mean by &#x27;the light&#x27; or &#x27;light energy&#x27; is it will not work. Therefore, it has to be replaced in order for us to be successful.</div>

Because see, DARPA is not only trying to integrate a system; they&#x27;ve also been sending out some really nasty frequencies, which go right along the lines with trying to create another pandemic, which is something that we are not interested in, in any way, shape, or form. So we are down a DARPA facility in Cancun today and another one in America, which they believe is going to be their place of choice, I guess, or their hub, the hub? I don&#x27;t know, these are Trump operatives after all - this is a Barnum and Bailey circus; I&#x27;m waiting for the giant circus tent to erect over the White House at this moment in time.</div>

So I&#x27;m going to just touch base on those two things as well, because it&#x27;s important to understand true fractal banking. So we know that energy as it comes into this planet is pure golden Source energy. We also learned in the last report that that energy is diluted, and by the time it gets to us, it&#x27;s not actually energy really per se; it&#x27;s just a limited amount of white light, which is enough to keep us alive.</div>

<div class="line">Kim: The banking system was created in much the same way, whereby Marduk - not the Deep State, not the Rothschilds, not the Federal Reserve, not any of these folks - actually fractionated and pieced off that Source golden energy into millions of places. The banking and monetary system actually used your consent. If you look up the actual real meaning of &#x27;fiat,&#x27; it says &#x27;a formal authorization.&#x27; So by us as humans participating in a quote-unquote system that they kept repeatedly telling us was &#x27;fiat,&#x27; then it&#x27;s okay - we&#x27;re giving permission for Marduk to take that golden light from us.

Lower Astral AI creations of various AI systems, for purposes of control, not only of this planet but also of the Multiverse. Marduk really, really used humanity in so many ways it was crazy. These &#x27;gentlemen&#x27; that are trying to install all these systems fail to understand that they were never meant to have that kind of access. Nor would Marduk have given them that kind of access. And in some cases you could say that Marduk - long after his death - was preventing them as much as I was preventing them, and as much as Marduk was preventing me.</div>

So, yeah, that&#x27;s something they don&#x27;t have the option of doing. Not only that, they&#x27;re trying to take a Light system, or a system of Source, and turn it into something that could possibly be Dark, where they get pieces and bits of that energy or money before the humans ever get it, the rest of us. I don&#x27;t think they really understand how that works, and that&#x27;s about as much as I&#x27;m going to explain it on the Internet right now. Anyway.</div>

So they are, you know, in DNA and in consciousness; that&#x27;s what they are. And for some reason, they believe that they are not only superior to the humans but also superior to their ancestors - to the real aliens.
