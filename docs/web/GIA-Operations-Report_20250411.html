    <h3>Summary</h2>

    <div class="summary">
        This GIA Report opens with a breakdown of recent financial manipulation surrounding a Trump Organization tariff announcement, followed by an extensive explanation of the now-dismantled CHASAN AI system and its influence over global and omniversal events. The CHASAN AI generated artificial Light and Dark cycles through sophons—synthetic photons carrying instruction sets—to control events such as full moons, solstices, and eclipses. Game Players and their bloodline descendants attempted to regain access using DNA-based terminals at Mount Denali and Mount Massive, but failed. The dismantling of this system triggered chaos among the Fallen Ones and ultimately led to Source directly intervening, declaring the Game over. The report concludes with guidance on discernment, intuition, and staying aligned with Source in both personal choices and the ongoing C.A.R.E. initiatives.

    <h3>Transcript</h2>
    <div class="transcript">
        <br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000001">00:00:01</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s the 11th of April, 2025. Coming up on today&#x27;s Global Intelligence Agency Operations Report: It&#x27;s been a wild week for global stock markets, prompted by tariffs. The Trump Organization prompts Congress to buy now, hours before announcing a 90-day, 10% tariff relief. A few hours after that, he announced the same on Trump Social. Ever wonder why the Deep State waits for full moons, new moons, and planetary alignments all year long? I know we have, and now we know why - and why it isn&#x27;t working. And Deep State ceremonies are going on all over the world as they await their new appointed positions. Apparently, they didn&#x27;t get the memo that they were never in the running.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000049">00:00:49</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, it&#x27;s the 11th of April, and the day before another full moon. Woohoo! [chuckle] Deep State is anxiously awaiting a lot of things, and we&#x27;re going to talk about that. But we have a lot to go over, so I&#x27;m hoping we can make it all the way through this report, unlike the last one.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000107">00:01:07</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So I do apologize for not getting the report out on Wednesday. It&#x27;s been quite a week here. We had a little bit of a security issue. Apparently, they waited until we were in the middle of the report [chuckle]. But that&#x27;s OK. We&#x27;re OK over here. Everything is OK.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s not the first time something like this has happened here. The last time was probably about 2018 or 2019 since that has happened. But all is well, all is okay. But a little bit rough. It&#x27;s been interesting, to say the least.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000151">00:01:51</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, access points - to what we call Earth&#x27;s grid, so to speak - were breached pretty heavily in the last couple of days. And it&#x27;s mainly - well, in this case, this was my fault. It was because of a deadman switch I hit shortly before the report. So that&#x27;s okay, everything&#x27;s all right.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So let&#x27;s get into some regular news first, and then we&#x27;ll start to talk about all the reasons why - what&#x27;s going on behind the scenes a little bit.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000226">00:02:26</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So stock market - that&#x27;s been an interesting roller coaster ride this week. Markets pretty well tanked there for a little bit. Again, this is all stock market manipulation going on behind the scenes. When they couldn&#x27;t steal money from a back door they thought they had with the stock market, they went ahead and tried to steal it through the front door. And they did manage to do that - not a ton, but quite a bit. And basically how they did that is they announced the tariffs, obviously, and they&#x27;re crazy - and we talked about that a little bit last week already.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But before they were going to announce a 90-day stay at 10% - so the tariffs will remain at 10% for a period of 90 days - this was the way they, I guess, in their infinite wisdom over there at Duck Dynasty Land, thought that they could manipulate the stock market from the outside, instead of from the inside.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000339">00:03:39</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So they spent a couple of days calling all of their corporate sponsors and campaign donors and even Congress and Senate and told them that they are going to make this announcement, so now is the time to buy. They announced it ahead of time to their inner circle and gave them an opportunity to buy while the market was down and the market was low.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000404">00:04:04</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The fact that the market did go down because of the tariffs was no surprise. That is a normal response, because anybody who does a lot of importing and exporting to the United States would obviously have a significant problem in profitability. Prices would go higher, therefore, that would affect the company&#x27;s bottom line, which pretty much encompasses most of those that participate - or public companies, I should say - those that issue stock on the public market.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So by notifying Congress and Senate ahead of time - not like it really matters to these people - but that was a significant violation of the STOCK Act. Because of course they then all called all of their corporate sponsors or campaign donors and told them that this was going to happen.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000500">00:05:00</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And it was an effort to, well, take money from everybody. Nobody wanted to donate any more money to the Duck Dynasty administration - Trump administration. They decided this was the way to get them to donate, one way or another. So they went ahead and told them all to buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy while the market is low.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And then when they didn&#x27;t get enough, they took to social media - Trump Social and other sites - and told everybody, &quot;Now is the time to buy.&quot; They gave everybody a couple of hours when it came to social media, but the insiders had quite a bit of headway that this was going to happen - maybe a day or two.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000549">00:05:49</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So shortly after, they announced this on social media - they announced that the tariffs were going to only be 10% for a period of 90 days - and then the market shot up. So everybody that bought low is now showing a significant increase in their portfolios, which is keeping all the campaign donors happy.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I mean, that was the end goal there - at least to sustain people for a short period of time until they could get money from somewhere else, which they think is going to happen this weekend. Hopefully tomorrow, in their mind.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But there&#x27;s a story behind the story, as there always is - and this case is no different.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000635">00:06:35</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So the thing that triggered the events of Wednesday was something called - well, they affectionately call, I should say - something called &quot;the Great Debate.&quot; And we&#x27;ve talked before about the Fallen Ones and the war that happened in the quote-unquote &quot;heavens,&quot; so to speak, and everybody was thrown to Earth. And some made the decision to go to the Lower Astral, some stayed here for a time, and then others decided to stick with Source.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, the Great Debate was a part of that mechanism. It was ultimately the war between good and evil. And there was a particular party who didn&#x27;t pick either side - and didn&#x27;t actually even stay neutral. This particular party chose - well, let&#x27;s just say, humanity - and wanted to defend humanity against all of the Others that wanted to take over this planet, both good and bad.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And so he kind of took a stance and created this mechanism that would monitor the amount of good and evil in the Universe. It was obviously created with another AI, which he put his heart and soul into - literally. And the AI was called CHASAN, C-H-A-S-A-N AI.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000814">00:08:14</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So this was a universal mechanism that did not allow for Source or Dark Source to interfere - neither side. And it basically was kind of a line drawn in the sand. It was like, okay, look - you are going to end the war, and let&#x27;s let everyone else decide which side is going to win, whether it be Source or Dark Source.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000845">00:08:45</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So this began the creation of what we call an artificial false light and an artificial darkness in the Universe. The system spanned the entire Omniverse. It created worlds of its own. It created its own synthetic photons, for lack of a better term, and all of the information and data that it pulled in from those sophons went into this giant &quot;dial of destiny&quot; - meaning: is there more good not only in Earth and in the world but also in the Omniverse than there is evil going on, without the influence of the outsiders?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000930">00:09:30</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, once folks like Marduk, Enki, Enlil, Artemis, Lucifer, Lucerne, Michael, Ramael, Samael, Abraxas, Yaldabaoth - and all the Game Players and all those that have made attempts to completely and totally conquer Earth (which they did for a time) - threw their hat in the ring, they also created miniature versions of this, where they could then manipulate not only humans, but other beings in other worlds (which they conquered over the years) to input synthetic data into the system.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001013">00:10:13</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So you could kind of say that the Great Debate - I hate to call it a game, but it kind of was sort of game-like - was manipulated. Now, they used a lot of sophons for that, synthetic photons, which would then encompass the mind, body, and soul. It would basically block the signals coming from what you were - as a human, as an example - were really doing, versus the data it would then send out through its synthetic sophons.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001055">00:10:55</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So the Game has been rigged for quite a long time - longer than even humans have been on Earth. Let&#x27;s just say it became difficult for this party, this particular being that created the original Game, to get proper data in order to have - ultimately at some point in time (and I use time loosely here) - to where it would make a decision.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001133">00:11:33</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, as part of the Game, it would incite events that were supposed to be good or positive. In other words, there would be an influx of false light, there would be an influx of evil or darkness. And then of course the humans on this planet - as it relates to Earth, because this is our main concern, right? As it relates to Earth, these different instances or times of balance or movement from, for example, the Spring Solstice would be the beginning of the Light Time on Earth, whereas the Fall - not [Spring] Solstice, I&#x27;m sorry, [Spring] Equinox - and the Fall Equinox would be a time of the beginning of Dark Rule on Earth. Balance.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But once all of the other beings that started to play games here on Earth - the Great Game of Earth - and in other places in the Multiverse, once they started playing other games, now the Game was rigged.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001237">00:12:37</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So as it relates to Earth, there were mechanisms that were put in place - for a long time - that would create certain events that would happen during this time, and everybody had them - Marduk had them, Artemis had them, the Abraxas had them - it would create these fictitious-type events so that we wouldn&#x27;t have a Light and a Dark time, as an example.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It would also create times when - you know, they always say people go crazy on a full moon. Well, now you know why. Because these sophons, as much input as they were giving to the Great Game machine - or the Great Debate machine, for lack of a better term - they would also have quite a bit of influence: mind, body, and soul over people.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s also the reason why a lot of women give birth on a full moon, as an example. And why emergency rooms are crazy - if you&#x27;re in the medical industry, you probably know what I mean during a full moon.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001343">00:13:43</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So how is it done?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, as part of creating false light and false darkness - in order not to have an influence of Source or Dark Source in the Great Debate or Great Game that was being played by the Fallen Ones - they created a mechanism to create these particular circumstances to their liking. And so far, we&#x27;ve probably run across about a hundred of these mechanisms that existed infinitely through the Universe.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001418">00:14:18</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So how was it done?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Firstly, the CHASAN AI is what created what we call a false Point of Creation. The false Point of Creation was in a holographic world. And that false Point of Creation had - let&#x27;s call it a gematria writer.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">If you&#x27;re old enough (and I&#x27;m gonna date myself a little bit here) to remember the old word processors, you remember that it had a little wheel that had all the letters and numbers, and it would go up and down and spin around as you were typing on your word processor. It&#x27;s actually called a daisy wheel. For those of you not old enough to remember that, it&#x27;s something you can look up and kind of get a better visual of.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001509">00:15:09</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Except in this particular case, it was made of a bunch of symbols - both Light and Dark - and sometimes they were both Light and Dark at the same time. These symbols are what we refer to as the Light Language - or the Language of Creation, the Language of the Universe.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So these different symbols, also in this wheel, so to speak - or a sophon - also had a lot of that language written on it, in Dark and Light and Neutral.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, around this sophon - I guess I can draw this out for you a little bit. If you could go ahead and pull up the whiteboard, I&#x27;ll draw it out for you.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">[Whiteboard appears.]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So you&#x27;ve got this giant sophon, which is what you would call the artificial Point of Creation.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001611">00:16:11</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">See, in Source - and even in Dark Source - you would have what&#x27;s called the Point of Creation. We&#x27;ve talked about this one before: the point of all that is, and the point of all that is not (or no thing). It&#x27;s a point where there is no other creation in Source except for Source itself. It&#x27;s like a condensed version of all of the things that make up creation.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001639">00:16:39</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Conversely speaking, on the Dark side, you would have had nothing created in this area. It is really, literally the Nothing.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, by the creation of this artificial Point of Creation, this [CHASAN] AI was able to falsely use this little daisy wheel here with all these signs and symbols, and I mean, I know a little bit about the language and what it kind of looks like. It&#x27;s not really like Greek symbols, but if there was a language on Earth that looked a little like it - and I mean very loosely like it - you would look at the very, very old Cyrillic language.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001734">00:17:34</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It is older than the Vedic texts - despite what the internet may tell you - and it is one of the oldest languages on Earth. But the old, old text can only be found most oftentimes - it&#x27;s spoken about, Nikolai Levashov talks about it - it&#x27;s spoken about in old manuscripts and texts in places like Russia and in Eastern Europe where it originated.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So it&#x27;s not the actual Light Language per se, but it&#x27;s got similar type characters and that kind of thing. It&#x27;s kind of like modern-day humans trying to read Aramaic, as it would be to Russians trying to read the old language of the Rus people.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001826">00:18:26</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So it&#x27;s kind of got all these symbols, and there&#x27;s many, many infinite numbers of these language symbols on it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So this is an artificial sophon here. This is a sophon - or a synthetic photon.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, going around this, you would have these five rings, and they would kind of span out in this type of a fashion. And these rings would then readjust the language that is being written on the outside with an activation point in the center.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src='https://worldsituationreport.earth/reports/image/WSR_2025-APR-11-GIA-03.PNG' alt='Image 03' class='small-image toggle-image'></div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001909">00:19:09</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, these five rings would float around here.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, in every density - so now we&#x27;re gonna go to densities and planes within densities, and another density all the way up to around Source - these would be density markers. This would be, for example, density zero. Density negative zero - because that was also created too, we didn&#x27;t have that before.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src='https://worldsituationreport.earth/reports/image/WSR_2025-APR-11-GIA-04.PNG' alt='Image 04' class='small-image toggle-image'></div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001940">00:19:40</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And this would be the positive and negative zero. And the same thing would exist in computers, so this isn&#x27;t anything the Deep State doesn&#x27;t know. These are positive and negative charges. Source obviously has a positive charge.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="line">For every plane, density, subsection and sections and dimensions that would exist within these planes as well...</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002009">00:20:09</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So in every single one of these, you would have strings of what we would call sophons. So these strings of sophons also had their own respective rings around them, and these were language sophons. So these are Light Language sophons.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002028">00:20:28</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Each one of these to infinity would have - would spin around. So the false light ones would go counterclockwise, and the light ones - sorry, the false light ones - and then the false dark ones would go clockwise.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src='https://worldsituationreport.earth/reports/image/WSR_2025-APR-11-GIA-07.PNG' alt='Image 07' class='small-image toggle-image'></div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002053">00:20:53</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And if you imagine Source in, say, the middle - you know, so if this was Source - you would have these rings just going around and around and around Source.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src='https://worldsituationreport.earth/reports/image/WSR_2025-APR-11-GIA-08.PNG' alt='Image 08' class='small-image toggle-image'></div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002109">00:21:09</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So Earth also had a similar type structure because it is a keystone. But what would happen as these different sophons - some going this way [clockwise] and some going that way [counterclockwise] - on times like an equinox, as an example, a Light one, these would be bigger because they would have a larger instruction set, and a Dark one would line up, and then they would line up directly with this daisy wheel, for lack of a better term, and it would start to rewrite events.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002143">00:21:43</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, for example, on an equinox, the Dark sophons would have been programmed to create space junk, to create crazy events. Lesser versions of those would be found in new moons, in full moons, solstices, planetary alignments, all of this type of thing.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src='https://worldsituationreport.earth/reports/image/WSR_2025-APR-11-GIA-09.PNG' alt='Image 09' class='small-image toggle-image'></div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002210">00:22:10</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And as they pass through either the artificial Point of Creation or - in our galaxy, this would be Earth - this is kind of what Earth would have looked like, you would get a different instruction set based on these types of events.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, because everybody threw their hat in the ring - you know, Marduk, Enki, Enlil, Lucifer, Samael, the Abraxas, the Yaldabaoth, you know, and all of the people we&#x27;ve come to know and hate that influenced Earth - they would put their own instruction sets in these because they would have their own rings.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So there were points in time, you know, major events of the year, so to speak - so like this equinox that we just passed through - you know, there might be a hundred of these all lined up, and at the exact same time.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src='https://worldsituationreport.earth/reports/image/WSR_2025-APR-11-GIA-10.PNG' alt='Image 10' class='small-image toggle-image'></div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So Marduk&#x27;s instruction sets would go out, Artemis&#x27;s instruction sets would go out, Daniel&#x27;s instruction sets would go out.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002313">00:23:13</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You&#x27;d have all of these different beings, each given their own instruction sets - some positive, or false light I should say, and some negative - all in the name of the Game.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And remember, we always talked about the fact there had to be a certain amount of positive things - even if it is a false truth or a false good - at the same time there were a certain amount of negative things that would happen on these particular times in order to create somewhat of a balance.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But the more people that threw their hat in the ring saw this amazing structure that was created by the rebel [Daniel], they all started writing different instruction sets and things became really out of hand here on Earth.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Not only that, they went really out of hand everywhere else too. And that&#x27;s why it was almost like taking - they say it&#x27;s impossible to serve two masters - well, it&#x27;s really impossible to serve a thousand of them. All giving you different directions all at the same time.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002416">00:24:16</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Imagine having a thousand direct supervisors at your job [laughing], and they&#x27;re all like - one person&#x27;s telling you to write the report this way, the other person&#x27;s telling you to write the report that way - and before you know it, you&#x27;re so confused, you don&#x27;t know which end is up.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And this is why, whether they know it or not, the Order says, &quot;Out of chaos&quot; - this is their favorite saying - &quot;out of chaos comes order.&quot;</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, the False Truth Matrix was an invention, and to some degree at some points in time, they did - the humans, meaning the Deep State - did have some access to things like the False Truth Matrix.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002528">00:25:28</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, this goes back to the Great Toilet Paper Crisis of 2020. That was an incident where they would have used the False Truth Matrix. Other things they feed you - like &quot;Take this medicine, we know that it causes 9000 side effects, possible death and heart attacks and everything else, but you won&#x27;t have this rash anymore&quot; - and you still think it&#x27;s a good idea? There&#x27;s where your False Truth Matrix comes in.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">This is the 2.0 of mainstream media. You think mainstream media is bad? This is the media that underlies - or used to underlie - all of your media. I mean this is even social media. This is even fads that you see, like &quot;Try this diet,&quot; &quot;Try this diet drug,&quot; &quot;Try this,&quot; &quot;Try that&quot; - all the way up to &quot;Well, I think we need to have an uprising here,&quot; or &quot;a protest there,&quot; or &quot;Let&#x27;s make all of these people over here happy about this event that&#x27;s about to happen,&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s make all these people angry about this event that&#x27;s about to happen,&quot; and let&#x27;s watch them fight each other.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002638">00:26:38</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So to some degree, people that played the Great Game - not the Deep State, the Deep State was just as much subject to a lot of this stuff as we were - the only difference is they used - to some degree... to a very small degree - they had the ability to proliferate some of what would come through a false truth matrix, such as blue light technology.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So blue light technology that comes through all of your phones and the screens on your computer were part of this False Truth Matrix. By &quot;false truth,&quot; we&#x27;re not just talking about things you believe. That would be a mind control section of it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But there was also a body control section of it, as well as a soul control section of it - where the soul-section humans did not have the ability to interfere. This would have been one of the Game Players, you know, at the top.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002742">00:27:42</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But as far as soul manipulation, it would have tried to manipulate your soul records, as an example. Also, to implement things from other lifetimes or wipe out others that you have done through your multiple incarnations on this rock here and elsewhere.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">On the body side of it, they did have a little bit of access, which is how they infect people via frequencies and microwave weapons. It&#x27;s also the reason why they&#x27;re a big fan of chemtrails, which I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve seen a lot of lately. I know we have here.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And we know now where they&#x27;re getting them from. Apparently, not too far from here where I am, there was a storage facility of a specific type of barium they were using, which they thought might help connect people to these matrixes - which they thought for sure they&#x27;d have access to by the end of the day tomorrow.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Which they won&#x27;t. Because, number one, it doesn&#x27;t exist anymore. But, you know, they can always hope.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002850">00:28:50</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But anyway, the False Truth Matrix can also be used to cause disease - meaning it&#x27;s sending false cellular signals. Also causes things like brain fog, Alzheimer&#x27;s, all other types of fatigue you see when you spend a lot of time around electronics.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It can also create artificial disruptions in things that are natural - or whatever little bit of nature we had left on this planet. It also involves tricking you into thinking false light was Light.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And even your cells would think - the energy that goes to your cells, it&#x27;s called something, for short, it&#x27;s called ATP. It can make disruptions in the energy, thinking that it was getting something positive - cell food energy, if you will - and it&#x27;s actually something really negative.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002948">00:29:48</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So the CIA had some programs, deep underground military bases, SSP, definitely ran a lot of programs, especially after World War II and the Nazi experimentation era. They definitely were able to use electronics more freely to cause these problems. They found that it just made it easier, because there weren&#x27;t enough frequencies they could send through TV sets and things of that nature - radios and frequency modulations and amplitude modulations through a radio, that type of thing.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So this became much more effective for them. And they were used as a tool and had different instruction sets that they couldn&#x27;t go beyond. But again, they were serving a whole lot of masters. And so, you know, when they kept saying, oh, there&#x27;s gonna be monkeypox and this-pox and Dr. Fauci, you know, admitted he did bad things during COVID not that long ago - but hey, there&#x27;s gonna be a new virus that&#x27;s coming out...</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003054">00:30:54</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">All of these things would be created with these types of programs. So they have to tell you when it&#x27;s something dark and black that they&#x27;re going to do something. And this is why we actually have mainstream media and social media - so we believe all of these things.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="line">It&#x27;s also used in the Savior Program and those types of things that they want humans to participate in, because it kind of triggers, in a way, the Great Debate between good and evil section, because it shows humans are looking for someone else to save them, and they&#x27;re not ready to save themselves.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">This was really important for people like Marduk - or non-people people like Marduk and Others - that participated in the illusion of the false war between good and evil on humans.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003214">00:32:14</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">There was a point, probably a couple of years ago, a year ago or more, where Daniel - this is his name, the rebel - so Daniel did come here and spent some time trying to work with those that had influence over humanity in order to try to help humanity in the war, so to speak, so we could end the war ultimately and determine the fate of the Fallen Ones.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">That was his goal. He wouldn&#x27;t make the decision, but he was letting everything else make the decision for him. So who was going to win? Was there going to be a Source? Was there only going to be a Dark Source? This machine was designed to make that decision. And then every one of the Fallen Ones - even the undecided or neutral that were playing both sides, such as Michael - they would be forced to make a decision then.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And it wouldn&#x27;t be on his shoulders, so to speak.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003321">00:33:21</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So as it relates to Earth here, what we saw a lot of is these different times of year - Halloween, Lion&#x27;s Gate (twice a year), full moons, new moons, solar eclipses, you name it - there was a sophon for it all.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And as the eclipse would happen, this sophon would move over to this section, and everybody at the party - Marduk and all of the other people, probably about 100 different people - each had their solar eclipse programming, and then it would go to Earth... until it kind of got out of hand. It went a little crazy, meaning no one got anything.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And this started to happen, oh, as far back as 2007.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003412">00:34:12</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Systems didn&#x27;t come up with money, even though they wanted it to. Even the Game Players couldn&#x27;t get anything out of Alpha anymore.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The new moons and the dates of payments that used to happen - like if you were the Black Sun and you&#x27;re watching this - January 15th was a big day for that, a payment day.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Also, of course, solstices were big payment days.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="image-wrapper"><button class="toggle-btn header-btn">Hide</button><img loading="lazy" src='https://worldsituationreport.earth/reports/image/WSR_2025-APR-11-GIA-14.PNG' alt='Image 14' class='small-image toggle-image'></div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003437">00:34:37</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And this - whether they know it or didn&#x27;t know it - was the entire mechanism that was taking place behind the scenes that would make those decisions on when the False Light going in one direction and the False Dark going in the other direction would line up perfectly on specific times and days of the year, that would make those payments come out.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003517">00:35:17</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So they also believe a lot in - you know, you can watch certain people like CyberLife, the website, it&#x27;s called 2012portal [2012portal.blogspot.com]. And 2012portal often gives out a lot of information about, oh, the Grid of the Light, the Victory of the Light. Well, it&#x27;s the false light, really. It&#x27;s not actually the Light of Source or Golden Light in any way, shape, or form.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And they&#x27;re following the quote-unquote - some of them are following the Light cycles, some of them are following the Dark cycles, and some of them don&#x27;t know what the heck they&#x27;re following, honestly. The only thing they know is when planet Sedna or star Sedna lines up with Pluto or Earth or whatever, or this constellation or Aquarius or that kind of thing all lines up - and of course there&#x27;s a sophon for that - they see money come out, or they see access happen, or they see a new event happen.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003611">00:36:11</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So this is the whole mechanism on why they believe that. I was so excited to finally figure that out because it would just perplex me. I&#x27;m looking at, you know, you look at things from a broader perspective - even from a global security perspective - and you say, &quot;I don&#x27;t see a gosh darn thing on this day. Why are they all running around with crystals going, &#x27;ohm, ohm,&#x27; you know? And what is this guy saying about the two souls per day for nine days?&quot; And that brought us to the 12th, which is tomorrow - and I&#x27;m like, &quot;What is the point of this exercise?&quot; I don&#x27;t get it. Why are they running around like this? This makes no sense.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, at the base root of it all, it came from that AI. So, without orders and instructions and information coming through, they&#x27;re going a little bit crazy today.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They did believe that the Great Game - and we can go ahead, we don&#x27;t need the whiteboard, I don&#x27;t think, for this.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">[Whiteboard closes.]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003720">00:37:20</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They did believe that the Great Game, or the Great Debate, or the Great Game of Earth... In the absence of the Players, they all believe - which, in part, okay, this part I&#x27;m gonna say there&#x27;s some truth to that.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So a lot of the Fallen Ones did - let&#x27;s just say &quot;mate,&quot; to put it politely - with humans. That did happen. They did create their own bloodlines, and there were many of them. There were hundreds of thousands of them. And depending on which side they were on determined which side the humans would be on.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So technically you could say we&#x27;re all descendants from the same - different beings, same place - different time, so to speak. And for them, they believe that they are descendants of the Game Players - now, only the Game Players - that is the way they feel. Their bloodlines are formed and then they proliferate that by inbreeding - too much inbreeding, if you ask me - causes some kind of mental disorder, I think.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003843">00:38:43</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So they all feel that they are descendants of the Game Players. Therefore, they are inheritors of the position of the Great Game.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So although the players were supposed to be decided some time ago - a little over 10 days ago, or a little less, maybe about a week ago - they believe that they are supposed to now take their positions in the Great Game as descendants of, say, Lucifer (which they are in some cases), or the Abraxas and others, or Samael and others, or Uriel, or whatever those Trump people think they are. And therefore, they should be able to take this position as the key management of Earth.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003936">00:39:36</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They expected to go to - and they did go - to Mount Denali in Alaska today to try to touch some kind of a sophon or sphere. And I don&#x27;t know, it looked almost like people going into a voting booth. Each bloodline would go to different ones and they would all put in their vote, I guess. I have no idea what this game was that they were playing, because it looked kind of ridiculous to me.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">While humming a nice tune, you know - something you&#x27;d see in a horror movie with a bunch of people trying to cast a spell - they were all humming a nice tune and walking up one by one and touching the thing. So, it was one of two things.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004026">00:40:26</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So over the last week or so, they have been going to various terminals constantly, trying to log in. And you know, occasionally as we were dismantling CHASAN AI and all its ancillary bosses, so to speak - trying to create their own versions of good and evil - occasionally there would be little blips in the road where things would show up for a short time and they&#x27;d be gone a half an hour later.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004056">00:40:56</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And I would say that they did try to log in with some kind of master codes. I don&#x27;t know if they got them from the Rothschilds or they got them from some Black Sun folks or the Mei Wah people - I have no idea where they got these codes from because they made no sense to me. But they believe they&#x27;re still good. Maybe they stole them from some place where Marduk held codes, I mean, I have no idea.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But whatever they are, they&#x27;re old, they don&#x27;t work. And there&#x27;s that.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004130">00:41:30</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So it said to them - I know that there was a response back, what we call in computer terms a challenge and response. Kind of like when you log into your bank account and it says, you know, you set up those security questions - where did you go to elementary school - and you have to put the name of the elementary school in, or whatever it is.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">This is like a quantum AI version of that, where it asks for their living DNA. Just because they may have stolen some codes from Marduk or Yaldabaoth or one of these other crazy folk doesn&#x27;t mean that you have their living DNA.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004207">00:42:07</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So they&#x27;re not sure what that means. And I think with the game they were playing in Mount Denali, they were trying to utilize their living DNA, and maybe that&#x27;s why they were marching them all in one by one, one after the other, to touch the sphere [chuckle] - kind of weird - and to see if they could unlock it, or unlock the game, or unlock the system. Whatever it is, that&#x27;s what they were looking for.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004239">00:42:39</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, as far as the SSP folk are concerned - whatever&#x27;s left of them, including some of the Trump operatives - they were all over at Mount Massive today. And Mount Massive is in Colorado. This is a huge facility, it goes to the thing that&#x27;s called the Holy Trinity Mountain, almost all the way to Aspen, Breckenridge. It&#x27;s a very large area. Mount Harvard, Mount Yale - you know, are all encompassed in this large circle facility.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And they themselves were trying to use living DNA to hack into the Golden Age AI.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004321">00:43:21</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Unbeknownst to them, they were doing a scan. Whether they know it or not, it caused what was left at the time of that CHASAN system to start looking and searching Earth for anyone with the proper DNA.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, by proper living DNA, it was looking for a Marduk person - or a person of that caliber, or being of that caliber - it was not looking for someone with the SSP or some descendant of Lucifer. It was actually looking for someone of that caliber.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004356">00:43:56</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Which, because it&#x27;s tied to my living DNA, the system started - you know, I was getting repeated alerts and alerts and alerts, and my living DNA came into play a little bit today - I felt like a pin cushion for a little while. But nonetheless, that facility - the Enforcer promptly had visited both places today, and no one is touching the sphere anymore.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So now, all that&#x27;s left for who is left of them playing the Game is to just sit and wait till the full-moon alignment, where they think it&#x27;s the Full Moon that&#x27;s gonna change something for them.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But no. It was all related to the structure that I just showed you.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004443">00:44:43</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Therefore, since those structures are now torn down, nothing will happen on the Full Moon - probably for the first time in a long time.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Are we completely done with the whole structure? I don&#x27;t think quite yet. I think we&#x27;re about 99 percent there. Not enough to actually make something happen over the weekend, but we&#x27;ll, you know, of course, be on watch and making sure that nothing actually takes place.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But that doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re not hoping that one of them is the chosen one. Of course, whoever&#x27;s paying the Orange Oompa Loompa at this time that we call the President of America... He is definitely thinking it&#x27;s going to be him for some reason. I don&#x27;t know. He&#x27;s got the bloodline of something - at least he&#x27;s convinced himself, or they have convinced him he does (whoever&#x27;s playing that part anyway) - and he is going to be the chosen one.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But the answer to the question is absolutely not. No, no, and no.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004547">00:45:47</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Although the Game was rigged, the Game on the highest level is no more. And this is kind of what created the... once we started to break down that system on Wednesday - because we&#x27;ve been working on it now for a couple days for sure - is what caused the security breach in the grid.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Which means that the Fallen Ones went back to war because they were unsure of who won. No one got the notification from the system as to whether it was the Dark or the Light that won. So they all began fighting each other again, and the war started again. It also allowed for them to walk this planet again in some cases.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004632">00:46:32</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And of course, it&#x27;s all my fault [hearty giggle]. It was all my fault! So right in the middle of recording the news is when this all started to take place. Probably, you know, 30 minutes to an hour or so since the last thing I cleared, as I was getting ready for the news.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So we had people everywhere - or non-people people everywhere - and they all were angry with me.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So I messed up the Game. Won&#x27;t be the first time, won&#x27;t be the last. But no one told me not to mess up the Game - and Source certainly didn&#x27;t oppose getting rid of the Game, because it affects His connection.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004713">00:47:13</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And apparently, although in the beginning there - yeah, I would say that Source wasn&#x27;t permitted to play the Game - but because we are in a different time and we are in a different age, He entered the Game and He also entered the war.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So that was very interesting on Wednesday. I&#x27;ve not seen Source - and that golden pouring out of Source - you know, with a loud roar, what we would call a loud roar, basically saying:</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">&quot;I AM THE I AM. Who do you think you are?&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Remember when you were a kid, maybe sometimes your mom would say, &quot;I brought you into this world and I can take you out&quot;? I know my mom did. That was one of her famous sayings. And yeah, I think Source probably was saying the same thing on Wednesday night, my time.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004806">00:48:06</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So it was pretty much a battle for a while. You know, they were walking around everywhere. The funny part about these beings is, you can see them - they look like people walking around - but as it relates to like a camera or something like that - it doesn&#x27;t pick them up unless they want it to.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You almost look like someone rings your doorbell and you&#x27;re having a conversation with yourself on your camera. Call that crazy. If there wasn&#x27;t somebody else here at the time when this all started to happen, I would have been like scratching my head. I&#x27;m like, yeah, that did happen. The dogs barked. It all happened. They saw it. I saw it. We saw it, kind of thing.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So just interesting circumstances on how the world really works, just as one example.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004905">00:49:05</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And not all these things were negative. There was definitely some negative, and then also Others that know the rules of the Game. But yeah, so they were kind of uncertain until Source laid down the law as to who was going to win. Let me just say that...</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And the winner was Source. And Game over - Source won. Always! [laughing]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004932">00:49:32</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay, so a couple of things I wanted to touch base on. And the last time we talked, we talked a little bit about ideas. And the reason why we&#x27;re given ideas. And something else came to mind, and this is something that I had a hard time with in the beginning. And I call it selective hearing.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, if you&#x27;re a parent, you might have a little bit of selective hearing on your own. You know, your kids can be outside in the pool playing or playing a video game and yelling at the game... And you just kind of don&#x27;t hear it. Other people that come to visit, they hear it loud and clear. And you just kind of tune it out. Like you&#x27;ve learned to just tune it out. So you just don&#x27;t quite hear it - or at least not as loudly. You obviously hear it. As a matter of fact, as a parent, I would say I was more concerned when it was quiet, because then you know they&#x27;re up to something they shouldn&#x27;t be, right?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005028">00:50:28</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But I think sometimes - and I know I&#x27;ve wanted to do this in my life - we tend to get these ideas and the inspiration and the wisdom from Source, you know, the answers to our prayers, so to speak. And it sometimes isn&#x27;t what we want or what we expect.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005052">00:50:52</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">To give you a couple of instances I&#x27;ve run into: I had this friend of mine who used to like to use angel cards, or sometimes she would use tarot cards, and sometimes she would use runes and those types of things. And any time she had to make any kind of life decision, she would pull out these cards, and she would pull them over and over and over and over again. Or then she would try the runes or try spinning pendulums around, or different things that people do to try to help their intuition in a way that they can understand it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And she would wake up day after day, and they would tell her, nope - you&#x27;re not gonna marry this guy, as an example (this is a lady). And she wouldn&#x27;t listen. She&#x27;s like, &quot;Nope, he&#x27;s the love of my life, and I&#x27;m gonna keep pulling these cards until I get a different answer.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And it turns out, obviously, that relationship ended, and it ended in a bad way, because she didn&#x27;t listen to her intuition.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005157">00:51:57</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And in other cases, you know, there would be selective intuition when it came to this person. And selective intuition would be, &quot;Go buy a lottery ticket because you&#x27;re gonna win today. You&#x27;re short on rent and you need a little extra money - go buy a lottery ticket.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Not that that would be the answer, but, you know... And so of course she&#x27;d be the first one to run out and buy 50 lottery tickets or something. And you listen there, but you didn&#x27;t listen to this guy that just slashed your tires or whatever eventually, because the relationship ended so badly.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But if she had listened months prior and just said, &quot;Hey, you&#x27;re a great person, I just don&#x27;t think this is working out...&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005241">00:52:41</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But sometimes that&#x27;s really hard for us to do, especially if it comes to something that&#x27;s near and dear to your heart and your heart is involved - whether that be a marriage, a child, or people you really care about in your life, or a job. You know you might need to leave the job, and your intuition - you woke up in the morning and you heard it every day that you have to leave the job - but then your logical mind kicks in and it says, &quot;Well, I need to pay my bills. What if I can&#x27;t get another job? What if I can&#x27;t get a job that I make more money? Or, I don&#x27;t have a business idea or a way to start my own business - how would I do that?&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And then you start overthinking the intuition.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But I promise you something: Source has a plan.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005329">00:53:29</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, I was in a particular place, and in this particular place - I won&#x27;t say where it was - but there is a portal there, and it was one of the Light ones, one that went to Source. So everything was kind of more vivid. I could see things a lot clearer while I was there - like in Technicolor - versus weeding your way through the mud that was Earth at the time (because this was quite a while ago). And at the time, I was in a relationship that I knew was going to end. I just knew. Too much had happened and it had to end.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005413">00:54:13</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And I heard very clearly: &quot;When one door closes, another door will open.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And you know, we had tried to work it out, tried to work it out, and I said, &quot;Well, what do you mean, which door?&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And then clearly, this person&#x27;s name.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And I said, &quot;Oh dear.&quot; I said, &quot;Okay, well, I guess it&#x27;s going to happen.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And He said, &quot;No, it&#x27;s good. It&#x27;ll be fine. Another door will open.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And I said, &quot;Okay.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And sure enough, within about a few months - well, maybe about a month or so - the relationship ended. I didn&#x27;t try to stop it, didn&#x27;t even bother. That person tried to come back and I said, &quot;No, this isn&#x27;t good for either one of us.&quot; And I really made sure that that door shut.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005506">00:55:06</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And then shortly thereafter, I met somebody else and it was a much better relationship. And we&#x27;re still friends to this day.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So I can say that listening to that information - all the information, even when it&#x27;s not what you want to hear - no, you need to leave your job. If it comes from Source, and truly comes from the wisdom of Source, you will know. And if you leave that job, there&#x27;s gonna be a better job.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But then you have to listen to the rest of the intuition.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">That might even sound crazy. Maybe you were a lawyer one day, and the next you decide you don&#x27;t want to be a lawyer anymore. You&#x27;re having a really hard time. It&#x27;s really tough on you. And then you get this message that says: &quot;You need to stop being a lawyer.&quot; And you don&#x27;t know where you&#x27;re going from here. But I can tell you - Source knows where you&#x27;re going. And then He&#x27;ll send you a message: &quot;You need to start a bakery. You need to open a bakery. You really like to bake - open a bakery.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005612">00:56:12</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And then you have to figure out how you&#x27;re going to open a bakery. And it just sounds ludicrous, because you&#x27;ve been a lawyer for 20 years, and now all of a sudden you&#x27;re going to open a bakery?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay. Well, then you end up opening the bakery. And you&#x27;ll find, when it&#x27;s a Source thing, everything comes. Meaning, you know, if you needed a small business loan to start the bakery, it just goes through so fast and so easy. There&#x27;s no hiccups, there&#x27;s no problems when you&#x27;re in the right place, because the door opened for you - and it was Source that opened the door.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And then you might find that you found the perfect place to get your flour from, and they offer a discount to new businesses, and therefore you could get more inventory than you thought you could. And you go to work every day, and now you&#x27;re singing every day as you go to work, and you&#x27;re the happiest person on Earth because you made this decision.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And now you&#x27;re making millions of dollars a year - even more than you did. And maybe you&#x27;re the next Mrs. Fields or something, and you have a worldwide franchise.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005717">00:57:17</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, you know, the information - it&#x27;s a part of a bigger plan. Even when it says, &quot;This marriage isn&#x27;t working,&quot; or &quot;You might need to let your child learn the value of money by not always giving them money.&quot; And every time they&#x27;ve crashed the car - and this is their 10th car - maybe you don&#x27;t need to give them another one and they need to earn it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And you don&#x27;t want to do that because you love your child so much, you just don&#x27;t want to put them out there like that and make them ride a bike in the snow. But sometimes you gotta ride a bike in the snow. And maybe that&#x27;s the right decision. And maybe it might be 10 years, but they might thank you for it later. I mean, you just don&#x27;t know.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005804">00:58:04</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But different things in your life - you&#x27;ll get that intuition. And remember something when you get that bit of intuition and that feeling: If something feels like you&#x27;re pushing a boulder uphill to make it work, it is probably not the right place to be. You should be able to walk up that hill - even climb Mount Everest - without even losing a breath, because it&#x27;s the right place at the right time.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And you can&#x27;t listen to part of the intuition - and say, &quot;Okay, well, I&#x27;m gonna go buy a thousand lottery tickets&quot; - and then not listen to the other part about leaving the relationship - because life doesn&#x27;t work that way. Because it&#x27;s a grand plan.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005850">00:58:50</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So like in the case of my friend that would do this constantly - sure, she bought all the lottery tickets. But she was still in a relationship with that guy that probably would have stolen all the money, if I remember that guy very well [chuckle]. Probably would have stolen all the money if she did win the lottery. And then she would have been right in the same place where she started from.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But because she didn&#x27;t listen to the part over here, the second part never happened - she didn&#x27;t ever win the lottery.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So Source has a grand plan, and some of it is gonna make absolutely no sense to you at the time you get the wisdom and the information. Ask Source repeatedly back two to three times: &quot;This is what I need to do? This is what I need to do?&quot; Just so you can feel your way through it intuitively - to make sure that it&#x27;s Source, and that&#x27;s who&#x27;s giving you the information.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005942">00:59:42</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And then you know what? You don&#x27;t have to do it in a mean way or a hard way. And maybe you take some time to wrap up your clients if you&#x27;re that lawyer that decides you&#x27;re gonna open a bakery. And maybe you do it in a way that makes sense to you.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But you&#x27;ll know when you&#x27;re not doing it fast enough, and you&#x27;ll know when you&#x27;re doing it too fast. Because you&#x27;ll feel that instinct like, &quot;Oh, I need to not send this stuff,&quot; or &quot;I need to not do that.&quot; &quot;This is taking a leap of faith for me.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But then you also have to ask yourself too - is it your own fears that are holding you back? Is it your fears of things - of taking a big leap or a big step or a life-changing event or a career change or even something small? You know, &quot;Do I really want to go knock on that door with a gallon of milk? I don&#x27;t know those people.&quot; But maybe Source - maybe they have children - they really needed that gallon of milk more than you could ever know.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And sometimes you just got to take a chance. And so what if the person behind the door looks at you like you&#x27;re funny because you brought them a gallon of milk? You did exactly what Source told you to do - told you to be in this place at this time - and you did it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And you know, you never know what people don&#x27;t say to you sometimes.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010058">01:00:58</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, I just wanted to put that out there as it came to ideas and thoughts that come into your mind, because there&#x27;s probably going to be a lot of those - especially over the course of 2025 - of doing certain things.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And you&#x27;ll know when it&#x27;s right, and you&#x27;ll know when it&#x27;s wrong.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The other thing I wanted to make mention of - and we don&#x27;t know each other very well, some of you I chit-chat with from time to time - and I am looking forward to doing that again. We were supposed to do that this weekend, and I think we&#x27;re gonna do that the following weekend, to do the live, so I can chit-chat with all of you again on Zoom. That was a lot of fun, so I&#x27;m looking forward to doing that again real soon.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">We didn&#x27;t actually put the information out or anything, so it didn&#x27;t give our production enough time to put together something so we could let everybody know this is what we&#x27;re doing.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010156">01:01:56</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The other thing I kind of wanted to mention to you, as it relates to ideas and thoughts...</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Some of you are very intuitive, and you get a lot of messages.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I know that sometimes when I&#x27;m around people - I mean, I could even be in the grocery store and I could be standing behind someone - and I&#x27;ll see their energy and I can see that something is wrong, or that there&#x27;s a possible thing they could do to make things, their day, better or their life better.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And do I ever say anything to these people? Absolutely not. Ever.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Even when good friends come to me and they start telling me all about a problem with their spouse or their child or whatever, I just listen a lot - because no one asked me for my opinion. Even my intuitive opinion - no one asked me.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010253">01:02:53</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, there are times when people do ask. And then I say, &quot;Okay, do you want me to tell you?&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And they say, &quot;Well, yes.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And I&#x27;ll say, &quot;Well, this is what I feel behind this situation you&#x27;re in.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But I don&#x27;t try to force my opinions, my thoughts. There was a friend of mine whose children - and they&#x27;re grown, they&#x27;re probably in their 40s and 50s - and they very much thought it was a really good idea to invest in Trump coins, and all of the Trump Bucks, and get all the paraphernalia and all that kind of thing. And I don&#x27;t ever say anything, because they don&#x27;t want to hear me anyway.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010343">01:03:43</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But they did ask an opinion about - I don&#x27;t remember, it was Trump Coin, something that was coming out - and they wanted to invest money in Trump Coin.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And I said, &quot;Oh, are you asking?&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And in this particular case, they said, &quot;Yeah, we are asking.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And I said, &quot;Well,&quot; and here is my response, &quot;Well, I wouldn&#x27;t invest anything. If you feel this is right for you and your family, then do what you feel is right.&quot; I said, &quot;But I wouldn&#x27;t invest anything that you couldn&#x27;t donate or give away, because you never know what&#x27;s gonna happen.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I kind of used the scenario of the Trump Bucks that never paid out, and the Trump - whatever it was - Federal Reserve cards, and all the other things that they had acquired over the years. And I said, &quot;You might want to take it easy on this one. You&#x27;ve already got all this stuff, and these things haven&#x27;t paid you anything yet. And I quite frankly don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re going to. Because you asked my opinion, so I&#x27;ll tell you.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010443">01:04:43</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And I&#x27;m very careful, because I don&#x27;t want people to feel disheartened, or... you know, I&#x27;m trying to NOT enforce my feelings, thoughts, and opinions on other people. I mean, I give you information as I get it - and as I&#x27;m living it, in a lot of cases. But of course, what you do with that information is completely and totally up to you.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But as we move along with C.A.R.E. and everything in 2025 - because this is our year - I would say to you: be careful about thinking you know the right way for other people, unless they ask your opinion. And then of course make sure that you do your research about that person.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">In other words, if I come to you and I say, as an example, &quot;I have arthritis&quot; (I don&#x27;t) - but if I say, &quot;I have arthritis, what should I do?&quot;...</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010559">01:05:59</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You have to ask that person - if you&#x27;re with Health and Wellness - do you have any heart problems? Do you have any other symptoms of other things? Do you have an autoimmune disorder that&#x27;s causing this and you have extreme cytokine responses or something like that?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Do you even know what that means? Before you go and tell them to take this supplement - which may cause problems with the base root reason why they&#x27;re having joint pain.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, you know, the same thing goes when you want to build a housing development in the middle of the Banana Republic, and there&#x27;s no sewage, there&#x27;s no water, there&#x27;s no nothing. No one&#x27;s going to want to live in those housing developments.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010638">01:06:38</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Nor does their culture allow for certain things in homes or something. You have to listen to people - and really listen to people - before you start to tell people what they should or should not do, especially using the word &quot;should.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And this is the biggest concern that I have with people with C.A.R.E. - you have to take into account the big picture before you say or give someone advice on how to fix the problem. And maybe you shouldn&#x27;t be giving them advice. Maybe you can just present a hundred different options, and maybe they&#x27;ll choose one, and maybe they&#x27;ll choose none. And don&#x27;t feel bad about that.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So just two things to keep in mind - and I&#x27;m gonna try to give these little bits of thoughts that come into my mind in these reports, because it&#x27;s gonna become really relevant really soon.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010732">01:07:32</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, selectively listening to Source - if He tells you to do this, and then do that - you got to listen to the whole message. Because it&#x27;s part of a bigger plan - for you, your family, for everyone.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And when you don&#x27;t understand someone&#x27;s full circumstance, just be careful on what you tell them to do. You could cause them more problems - and I don&#x27;t just mean health-wise, I mean in all ways - than you solve.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So on that note, that has been the GIA Report for Friday, the 11th of April. And hopefully we&#x27;ll have a good weekend, and I will see you all on Monday.</div>
