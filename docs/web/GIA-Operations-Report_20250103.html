<div class="line">TEASER:</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, it&#x27;s the 3rd of January, 2025. Can you believe it? I&#x27;ve been talking to you guys now for, well, probably about, oh my gosh, almost five years. Since my first radio debut, I guess you would say, and then on to UNN. So, remember the Life Force calls back in the day? We&#x27;ve certainly come a long way since then, and I just wanted to thank the whole team for that because they&#x27;ve been so great at progressing UNN. We have some really cool things to look forward to this upcoming year. We have a New Earth Series coming out which is going to talk about you - mind, body, and soul - and your connection to the planet. So, there&#x27;s a lot of good things coming up for 2025 as far as UNN is concerned.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000103">00:01:03</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, I guess let&#x27;s do a little bit of a different kind of GIA Report tonight. And I thought about this a lot based on everything that&#x27;s going on out there. And there&#x27;s a lot of you that are new. You&#x27;ve been around for a little while, or maybe you found me because of the financial video. I know a lot of people did. And I thought I&#x27;d do some updates to that. A little bit of an explanation as to who we are, what we do, kind of in brief, what my positions are, and I guess where we are going from here. There seems to be a lot of confusion out there as far as governments are concerned and other financial folks are concerned. They seem to be thinking that if I said, for example, &quot;I&#x27;m a chicken,&quot; everybody would be running around trying to figure out how to turn their person into a chicken. [chuckling] As is everybody trying to turn around and be the one who is the Guardian or be the Ground Commander or be the Gatekeeper, or be all of the things that I just happen to be. And it&#x27;s been kind of funny actually over the last few days.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000224">00:02:24</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So we&#x27;ll start with kind of what&#x27;s been going on, I guess, since Monday. So we had a New Year&#x27;s Eve, and in the past, many years ago, on New Year&#x27;s Eve, the Pentagon and other intelligence agencies would receive a cash payout. And why would they receive a cash payout? Because, well, at the time we had a war going on on this planet. Not only a war, so to speak, as in Global Martial Law - we also had a much larger war going on on this planet. And that war is millions of years old. It had been going on for quite a long time, and it&#x27;s pretty well over now. But they seem to still believe that if they stood there, I guess, at midnight Eastern Standard Time at 12:01 and tried to declare global martial law or martial law in their respective countries, that they would receive a big payout. Well, that didn&#x27;t happen. They also did rituals at the Pentagon. This was a very interesting thing because normally people of that caliber wouldn&#x27;t participate in rituals. And I found that pretty interesting. You had those who wear skirts, and if you are, let&#x27;s just say, well read in the alt media, you will know which societies wear skirts - men who wear skirts - and they&#x27;re not Scottish. You would also have seen a lot of people in robes doing a lot of rituals as well.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000409">00:04:09</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And this has continued pretty much every day or every night. They like to do things at night and early in the morning because that&#x27;s what they do. I guess they think it&#x27;s the power of the night or the moon - not sure. But anyway, this continued on until last night, with the attempted rituals. But on New Year&#x27;s Eve, I guess you would say New Year&#x27;s Day officially at 12:01, by about 12:25 to be exact my time, every alarm I had started going off. Why? Not because they were dancing in skirts. Men in skirts are fine. That doesn&#x27;t set my alarms off. [chuckling] Sorry, that&#x27;s a little bit funny because I was like, what are these people doing? What is that? You know, why? What set my alarms off was the amount of attempted hacking that happened. It wasn&#x27;t like we had an attempted invasion or anything like that. It was just a tremendous amount of hacking and a huge uptick in chatter.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000518">00:05:18</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So I have my systems set. For those of you that don&#x27;t know, I have a Key Intelligence and Military System that I have built myself. And the Key Intelligence and Military System monitors the world for security. We&#x27;ve talked about this on various reports before, but I just thought I&#x27;d reiterate that in case you&#x27;re new and haven&#x27;t watched this before. And the Key Intelligence and Military System has ties into basically every single intelligence agency in the world, every single military in the world. It also has the ability to monitor via our own, well, I&#x27;m not going to say it&#x27;s a human version of a satellite, but I&#x27;d say they are special satellites that can detect extreme amounts of danger, if someone tries to do something outlandish, right down to an uptick in chatter. I have things set specifically for specific people, meaning myself, obviously. If there&#x27;s a security concern and that type of thing, I will get a message immediately. It doesn&#x27;t matter what time of day or night, unfortunately. And this was one of those nights.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000629">00:06:29</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So apparently they were really confused as to why they did not get a payout. Well, this is going to take a little bit of explaining, and I&#x27;m going to go over each sector of control systems in the world as they were, and as they are, so that people can actually understand where we&#x27;re going. And by people, I mean you. The complex structure that was set up by &quot;non-people&quot; that trickled down to the &quot;now-people&quot; who are trying to revive these structures or fix these structures or just take control over everything and just plant a flag and say, &quot;It&#x27;s mine - the world is mine,&quot; like Dr. Evil or something, I don&#x27;t know. But this seems to be a common theme. The other thing people are doing out there is they&#x27;re re-watching the financial system video I did a long time ago. I think it&#x27;s been about close to four years now. And a lot has changed since then. So we&#x27;re going to talk a little bit about that.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000748">00:07:48</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s going to be a lot of whiteboarding tonight, just so that everybody can kind of understand where we&#x27;re going into 2025. Now, things should get a little bit rocky here. We expect, based on our current data and analysis, we expect an uptick, and continued uptick in events, so to speak, coming from the Deep State until probably mid-morning on Sunday. So today&#x27;s Friday; I get to spend Friday night with you guys. And I would say that we would see a lot tomorrow. Now the reason why there&#x27;s going to be a lot tomorrow is because of these big payouts that were promised. And this, of course, is predominantly being run by the SSP military right now. They are also working in conjunction with the group we call Langley 5, or the group of generals that are over Langley, and the Global Headquarters Group. So you could say the Black Sun side.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000858">00:08:58</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They had some meetings that took place earlier this week as we had talked about on Monday. I think we had talked about them. And where the operatives were promised that they would have some contracts, they said, &quot;Ah! Give them another day or two,&quot; they said. They said that &quot;It&#x27;ll all work out. Your Trump contracts will be out. That&#x27;s exactly what they called them in the meeting. &quot;Your contracts from Trump. He loves you. He won&#x27;t forget you.&quot; And they buttered that bread so thick. I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s any butter left in the United States; I have to be honest with you, and probably not a whole lot left in the Middle East either. They kept slapping that on there. It was so thick. It was ridiculous. So they said, &quot;Give us a couple of days.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000942">00:09:42</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And those &quot;couple of days&quot; were up New Year&#x27;s Day. Another meeting takes place. &quot;Well, we did what we needed to do, and it looks like it&#x27;s all coming through now. And we should be all in the clear by, oh, Saturday, they said.&quot; And since that time, they are repeating the exact same thing they always do. They have the good majority of the NSA on board, what&#x27;s left of the ACIO, which is the higher division of the NSA, who used to report directly to Marduk - a non-human being - at one point in time, which is important when we talk about these structures. They might be a little bit more well-versed in, let&#x27;s just say, non-human-created AI systems. And they may have more experience when it comes to gateways and portals and how all of that works. In conjunction with CyberLife. CyberLife has also been very active. Delphi Military has also been very busy here at a mountain in Colorado. And those particular Delphi folks are not here anymore.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001102">00:11:02</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But this seems to be a continuous process. They&#x27;re also talking about things - not talking about - I should say &quot;hacking,&quot; to try to install things like another pandemic, for one. This is something they would like to have. And I don&#x27;t know if they just keep repeating the same cycles, thinking that this is how it happens. And when I think about this, and I&#x27;ve said this in news reports before, if you look up the chain of events that took place right before World War II, and the chain of events they&#x27;ve been trying to implement now for about three or four years, you&#x27;ll kind of see a lot of similarities. At the start of World War II, we had a coronavirus pandemic, right before World War II started, and the flu pandemic, and a few other things. And then, of course, that pandemic then escalated into war, which lasted for some time. And the whole world was involved.</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now at that time, war made money. There was a reason for that which served non-humans. By that I mean there is a bigger war that&#x27;s going on. So we&#x27;re going to talk about, first I think we should start with military and intelligence, and why everybody believes what they believe. There is a lot of talk and chatter about the U.S. military being the savior. There is also continued talk about this martial law. Maybe we need a global martial law because U.S. martial law didn&#x27;t get us paid, so maybe a global martial law will work. Well, the mechanisms that are behind these things are not automated. They are not automated. It&#x27;s not just the money, it&#x27;s all of the other mechanisms that would kick in to implement an agenda that was set by someone. That &quot;someone,&quot; at the time of these events working out, was a Ground Commander. So let&#x27;s talk about different positions, different things, and where we can go as far as military and intelligence is concerned.</div>

<div class="line">Now, we&#x27;ve started the ball rolling here with the GIA. Now, the GIA in the past was an organization that was pretty large, and everybody in every government everywhere knew who the GIA was. The GIA contained a lot of individuals that escalated to a certain level, let&#x27;s just say, in the intelligence community. They were able to walk in and out of any government, any military building, anywhere, at any time in the world. They could walk into the White House or any other colored house, the Parliament, or the House of Lords, or anywhere. They had the clearance, and they had the access.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001420">00:14:20</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Where would the GIA stand in relation to the SSP? Well, the GIA wasn&#x27;t created that long ago. I&#x27;d say a few decades ago, not obviously by me - I wasn&#x27;t even born yet when the GIA was created. However, I did acquire the GIA as part of the new structures that were coming into play based on a chain of events that happened. Now this happened a long time ago. This has been almost a decade. It will be nine years this year that I acquired the GIA. And the GIA, I would say, could be in some cases a face front for the SSP. You could say some of the people with the SSP also held positions with the GIA, depending on their job and their purpose. I would say that currently I have wiped out the database, not, well, let&#x27;s just say, don&#x27;t think I have not actually downloaded the entire fulcrum, meaning all of the data of every operation the GIA ever ran, but I wiped out the database of personnel.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001539">00:15:39</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, there are still people out there running around calling themselves GIA, and for some reason, everybody just believes them, even though their databases don&#x27;t show that. Now in some cases the governments, so to speak, are still listening to these people; therefore, they allow them into their database as anything they want them to be. That could be the Global Intelligence Agency; that could be the Mickey Mouse Club. It doesn&#x27;t matter because they just have the clearance. They set a number. You know, Majestic 12 was in there. So there is a lot of, let&#x27;s just say, fraud going on out there as far as the people that are still working&#x27;s ability to do what they do.</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-001628">00:16:28</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now this is what causes some disruptions in the world. Some of these disruptions are, number 1, you know, they&#x27;re there now in several countries as the shadow government. Now most of these guys are the Americans. I call them the Duck Dynasty and Cowboys because they kind of all hail from the southeast of America. Not all of them; there&#x27;s some Chinese and Japanese and some from other countries too. But the majority of them that are kind of allegedly running the show, oh lordy lord, are American cowboys. And the Cowboys are... how do I say this... the Cowboys are under the impression that with a lack of humans over their head and a lack of non-humans over their head, that they should now be in charge.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001731">00:17:31</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Because they feel like they have given themselves - let me make it very clear - they have given themselves enough clearances in enough government to actually become the shadow government. They have done this in Israel. They have done this in Syria. They are trying desperately to do this in Iraq. They are also present in Iran. There&#x27;s still a little bit of a fight with some Chinese there because the Chinese government, Politburo Black Dragons, runs Iran, in case you don&#x27;t know that. There are also plenty of them in Russia. They are currently running the Russian government, I guess you could say, and definitely in England and in different countries in Europe. So they have an intention of creating political control. And political control is important if you want to run the world.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001833">00:18:33</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">This is the way they think. Because this is the way it was. Having political control gave you control over the countries, they think. Now, they&#x27;ve sent all their political operatives to do all of their political operative stuff. And most of these guys are older. You know, they&#x27;re probably from the Reagan era. There&#x27;s a number of them from the Reagan era. And they still talk about it like it&#x27;s their glory days. And there&#x27;s some younger guys there. And then they&#x27;ve got a whole slew of operatives that are following them, looking up to them, believing that they are in charge, believing that they are the leaders just because they said so, and they&#x27;re using, in a lot of cases, Trump as a face front.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001922">00:19:22</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Because during the Trump administration - just to be very clear - there was a large amount of funding that came out in March of 2018. And in March of 2018, I was able to, for the first time, push money out of the system. Now I got stuck at the central bank level and treasury level; however, that didn&#x27;t stop them from spending it, and, of course, there were a number of people that also claimed that they were the ones that did it. Now in this case, &quot;Trump did it.&quot; Now you see what happens when you get stuck in a little bit of a lie? Because I did that, I funded a couple of budgets, and I paid off the U.S. debt to China during the Trump administration. I sent out money for hurricane relief, which never came - if you&#x27;re in Florida, you know that. I also sent out more relief for California. I explained that if we didn&#x27;t plant trees, you were going to have mudslides, and have mudslides, we did.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002030">00:20:30</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I did a lot of things during that administration and had many, many conversations with Trump and, let&#x27;s just say, people that were permitted to be in the room. A lot of those people were thrown out of the room when the phone would ring. Sometimes they would call me ahead of time or call Tom Melville and tell Tom that the phone was going to ring. So yeah, because they claimed that they did - this is the SSP operatives, of course - because they claimed that they and, of course, Trump did all of these things and gave them all of their contracts and he got it done. I&#x27;ve even heard that exact term from an operative. He said to me, &quot;Trump got it done.&quot; I said, &quot;No dear, I got it done.&quot; And, based on past events, things that didn&#x27;t happen. I&#x27;m just going to reiterate this real quick, and then we&#x27;ll get into the entire structures. So, this is a good time to revisit the old stuff that we did and implement some new things. We&#x27;re going to have new information about C.A.R.E. and stuff too.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002145">00:21:45</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So as far as political structures go and what&#x27;s happening in the world right now, this has kind of left the Trump operatives in a little bit of a pickle right now. I mean right now. And this kind of ramps back up again around, oh I don&#x27;t know, five o&#x27;clock Eastern time. You know there were some people that were promised money by the end of the day. And they&#x27;re running some operations in a few other countries. Philippines is one. They&#x27;re running some operations right now in South Korea and a few other areas of China which deals with historical assets. So we&#x27;re going to cover that as well and what happened to those and why they&#x27;re not valid.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So they&#x27;re claiming that there are all these assets out there, and they can&#x27;t quite keep their story straight. So they&#x27;re not very good operatives because, like, operatives are kind of trained to lie. And these people are kind of trained to lie. But the story doesn&#x27;t hold true through all of the channels in this case. And what I mean by that is the Trump lawyers are under the impression that they are going to collect all of these assets. This is a quote from the attorneys that deal directly with soon-to-be-inaugurated President Trump. They said, and I quote, that we are, meaning the organization, &quot;is collecting all of these assets for use of America.&quot; You know, I guess that would probably be the Treasury or whatever plan they&#x27;ve got. I mean, they have no financial common sense there in Cowboy Land. But they plan on doing something with these assets allegedly to benefit the United States. That&#x27;s not a thing.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002353">00:23:53</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But on the flip side of it, we heard from the CIA that the CIA, in cooperation with the Knights of Malta - and you know who I know; I know who you are - and a few others are trying to collect assets in the Philippines and in China and also in South Korea to quote-unquote &quot;destroy the assets.&quot; Now this is what they&#x27;re telling countries. In Malaysia they also tried to do the same thing; however, the country of Malaysia said they would rather hold on to their historical assets and not give them up to the Cowboys, aka your current administration coming into office now. So that being said, there&#x27;s one hand that says they&#x27;re going to destroy them, do the right thing, take them off the market so that they&#x27;re not a quote-unquote threat, you know, and they&#x27;re telling all kinds of stories to these countries. On the flip side of it, they&#x27;re saying they&#x27;re going to use them for their own benefit.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002459">00:24:59</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now if you are in South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, or any other country that thinks you&#x27;re going to get your historical assets back, I know that they have been promising the Middle East back their gold, and a couple of African countries are in there too. Yep, just so they can be the shadow government of those particular countries. But you know, it&#x27;s a pretty well-known fact where they&#x27;re in the other places. They&#x27;re going to return your gold to you. Have you heard this one, Iraq? I know you did. Yes, you did. And other countries as well. You know, from allegedly other past administrations who were bad administrations that took this gold for decades, I mean going all the way back to Hoover, we&#x27;re going to return those assets back to you. Yeah.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002552">00:25:52</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They have no hope of returning those assets, and I know that because a lot of them aren&#x27;t in the same place that they put them. Number 1. And number 2, they don&#x27;t understand the cross-collateralization that form things like your Red Book and your Blue Book. And I know this because the Blue Book, let&#x27;s just say, has lots of accounts and lots of hallmarks on things like the Flying Horse or a Pegasus is what&#x27;s on the hallmark of those. You also have the Vatican&#x27;s alleged gold, which had the Omega symbol on it. That was the hallmark there. There was stuff in the hills of Laos and Vietnam they&#x27;re looking for, which is no longer there. So pretty much what they&#x27;re doing is lying to you. They say they&#x27;re going to take the other stuff and destroy it and pay them a fee.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">0:26:42</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Yeah. No, they&#x27;re never going to pay you. Number 1, they can&#x27;t. They&#x27;re borrowing money from everybody they can right now just to survive. There&#x27;s also a quote-unquote, and this is the story I&#x27;m hearing, &quot;debt call,&quot; allegedly. And, you know, I got a few phone calls today about that. They&#x27;re saying that there&#x27;s a huge debt call that&#x27;s going to take place, and that&#x27;s going to crash the banking system, if somebody doesn&#x27;t do something about it. Well, I&#x27;m guessing at this point that someone must be me. They&#x27;d like to have me do something about it. But I&#x27;ve kind of accounted for that fact, really. And, you know, we, as humans, meaning the rest of us walking this planet that are not involved in this game, we&#x27;ll be just fine. Really, you will be. You might have a little bit of a topsy-turvy time if you have some stock investments or something like that, if it did happen. I doubt they&#x27;re going to let it happen unless, you know, they&#x27;re completely out of options.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002753">00:27:53</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But every retirement account can be refilled. Everything can be made right for the people. And it just wouldn&#x27;t be under anybody&#x27;s umbrella, maybe like you see it now. So really not that concerned and that worried about this alleged debt call. I did some digging, though, into this debt call. Turns out the majority of this quote-unquote debt call crap that they&#x27;re talking about, and rumors that they&#x27;re throwing out there to everybody, is not exactly, I mean, yeah, there&#x27;s some government bonds out there that expire and a few other things. But a lot of these things were issued recently. There were also a lot of other debts, against oil contracts and stuff that they&#x27;ve been trying to pay out on for years. But the majority of this debt call is - let&#x27;s translate that into Deep State terms - a bunch of lip service. And the lip service, I mean, is that they have been out there wheeling and dealing and making loads of promises and giving fake assets and all kinds of stories to one group and other stories to another group and stories to this country and stories to that country, and they have zero capacity to perform this function. But they&#x27;re telling everybody, hands down, that first, you know, New Year&#x27;s Day would have it. We&#x27;ll have it on the full moon, or the black moon. That was a mess there. It&#x27;s been kind of a little bit of a, I&#x27;m like, wow, that&#x27;s really happening over there, you know, and I&#x27;m looking here and there and watching all this stuff happen with all these people, and they seem to be very confused as to how the world really works.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002941">00:29:41</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And I know a lot of you are new here, and I&#x27;ve never done this live, really, since the days of Life Force. So I thought it would be a good time to start 2025 off with a complete understanding - or at least an overview - of how the world really works, then and now. And by &quot;now,&quot; I mean that we&#x27;ll talk about &quot;now&quot; as in who sits where, and we&#x27;ll talk about why their gates aren&#x27;t opening. And we&#x27;re going to talk about where we, as people, are going. What is C.A.R.E. for? What is it going to do? How does the Marketplace fit into this stuff? Why are we doing all of these things?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And I know there&#x27;s a number of people that don&#x27;t quite understand that. And it&#x27;s obvious from reading some of the chats. I see a lot of stuff where people are talking about the Constitution. Let&#x27;s restore the Constitution. Well, you clearly haven&#x27;t read the Constitution. It&#x27;s got nothing to do with you. I mean, if you told me, &quot;Let&#x27;s fix the Bill of Rights,&quot; or something, that would make sense to me. You know, there&#x27;s... Everybody says, &quot;Oh, there&#x27;s two constitutions, we need the real one.&quot; You know, there&#x27;s some really bad stuff written on that original constitution, and most of the people that signed that constitution were Freemasons. And Freemasons also wear skirts on special occasions and dance around bonfires on New Year&#x27;s Eve. Yes, they do. So be careful what you&#x27;re looking for and be careful what you wish for.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003126">00:31:26</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I say this with a lot of love and caring for you, but I also say this from the standpoint of looking at the planet and where we are and where we are going. Over the last couple of months, we&#x27;ve experienced a lot of growing pains. And there are a lot of people getting a lot more intuition. Yes, they try to stifle that down - they&#x27;re sending out frequencies - they&#x27;re doing everything that they can as humans and as remnants of AI systems to knock you down. But really you have that connection, and it&#x27;s getting stronger and stronger. So when I say be careful what you wish for, maybe I should say be careful what you&#x27;re manifesting, what you&#x27;re bringing into your life. What is it you really want? Do you really care about a constitution? Do you care if there&#x27;s a change in your government? Do you care? How does that affect your life personally? How does that affect your loved one&#x27;s life, your neighbor&#x27;s life, and the lives of everybody in your country? Because you are the majority. I know it doesn&#x27;t feel like that a lot of times, but you actually are the majority. And if the majority of people got together, the world would be a different place.</div>

<div class="line">But they keep us compartmentalized. They keep us compartmentalized and labeled by color, by nationality, by movies, and by who&#x27;s the boogeyman in the movie, by putting out an air that they are omnipotent. That the Deep State, Illuminati, Families, Banking Families are omnipotent. And a lot of people in the alt-media perpetuate this omnipotence, kind of, how do I say it, by accident? Or maybe they don&#x27;t realize what they&#x27;re putting out there. By saying they&#x27;re capable of doing all of these things, or have done all of these things, you are making them out to be more than they actually are. There was a number of different things back in the day; I&#x27;ll give you an example. There was a number of different things back in the day where, in the media, in the mainstream media, they would say that &quot;Putin invaded here,&quot; or, &quot;Putin did this.&quot; And I&#x27;m like, wow, all by himself, huh?</div>

<div class="line">He did that all by himself. He moved the mountain, moved the border, changed this. You know, no, he didn&#x27;t. You know, this was created by hundreds of operatives; yes, there&#x27;s a lot of them. There&#x27;s not a whole lot left - there&#x27;s a lot less than there was at that time. But there&#x27;s a lot more of you. So a friend of mine said to me today, &quot;Don&#x27;t plant apple seeds if you want oranges.&quot; And that&#x27;s pretty wise and something maybe you should consider, especially in 2025, because you are going to change the most. Yes, we&#x27;re going to see some things change this year, I&#x27;m pretty sure. Probably by about mid-February, end of February is when you&#x27;re going to start to see a lot of changes in the world. And, first of all, it&#x27;s going to be quite disturbing, but for you, you&#x27;re pretty well read in. You know what&#x27;s going to happen - if you&#x27;re watching this, you pretty much already know.</div>

They can be mad at me all they want, but the world has changed. And it&#x27;s not going to go back. It&#x27;s going to change more. You&#x27;re going to see rapid changes in 2025, like you&#x27;ve never seen them happen before. And it&#x27;s going to be your job to help these other people understand this chain of events.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And I try. I give the information, and I try. And it&#x27;s not always well received, but, you know, hey, that&#x27;s not my problem. My problem is that I need to put out the information; I need to inform you of what&#x27;s happening and how these changes are happening and what you can expect. But I expect to see major changes this year, based on the data that I have. For one last time, we&#x27;ll explain it for all of you that are new. We&#x27;ll leave this up on our app after we&#x27;re done here and probably go up on YouTube and a few other channels as well, where it&#x27;s out there. If anybody has any questions, you can just watch this because it&#x27;s going to be quite informative.</div>

<div class="line">So, where shall we start? Do we want to start with the military and what happened to military and intelligence two days ago? And why I know that there are no operative contracts going out on Saturday, despite them yelling and screaming at me? Why I know that there&#x27;s a large banking meeting? - There&#x27;s a lot of banks meeting over the weekend in New York. And I know that they&#x27;ve invited Tom Melville there. Why I also know that China threw out a big, ridiculously overpriced - I&#x27;m going to say ridiculously overpriced - alleged hydroelectric plant that costs more than the GDP of planet Earth and why I was supposed to fall for that. On that note, that&#x27;s because China&#x27;s - now that the Trump operators have kind of screwed up - China&#x27;s back on that &quot;transfer the world power over to China&quot; plan, and the Chinese Elders and the real ones, and the master keys - and then the dumb Cowboys go after the Chinese people, and then they&#x27;re like, &quot;Hey, we want those master keys! Give them to us now, or we&#x27;ll bomb your whole country,&quot; or whatever they sold them. And so they give up the master keys, and they don&#x27;t work either.</div>

<div class="line">It&#x27;s like circles after circles after circles with those people. And then all of you, and your governments, respectively, regardless of where you are in the world watching this right now, are stuck with these people. Until you decide you&#x27;re going to make a change. I mean we can break it down from the top, but you&#x27;ve got to be ready from the bottom too. So, all right, without further ado, let&#x27;s start with military and intelligence structures. This seems to be quite confusing for people, so let&#x27;s lay it out there, and then we&#x27;ll go over financial structures, then and now; we&#x27;ll go over all the structures of the world, so everybody has a better understanding of where we came from, how far we&#x27;ve come - because that&#x27;s important too, because all of your hard work and our hard work together have not gone unnoticed, let&#x27;s put it that way, to those that really matter in the world and in the Universe. So, all right, whiteboard.</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Here we are. Okay. So let&#x27;s talk about military structures as they have been for a long time. First of all, we had a war. And I touched on this about a week ago, so I&#x27;m not going to, oh, it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m writing on there. I&#x27;m not really sure why. Oh, there it is, a little bit of a delay - too much streaming. Okay. So we had war. And by war, I mean a universal war, basically those of the Light Universe, or those that are of the Creator, meaning Source, God, however you want to say that, versus the Dark. And by Dark beings, we mean some Dark AIs. Probably about... I don&#x27;t know; I think they were up to about 200 or so, 200 AI systems. And then we had many beings. We know some as the Abraxis. These are all pretty much AI-created beings, or they were created by the Black Magician, assisted by beings that were held in a Merkabah or a binding where they could harness their energy to create for them.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004043">00:40:43</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And on the Light Side, war was declared against Source. So they were against Source and basically all natural creation. You know, they&#x27;re almost as ridiculous as the Cowboys in some cases, but they caused a lot of damage. Not only damage here on Earth, and Earth being a keystone, it was a prized possession in the war. The reason why is because it held the DNA blueprints of the entire Universe, contained in its celestial self, because Earth is a being, just like you.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So that being basically had a disconnect from Source for a time based on the start of this war, which has been going on - or went on I should say - for over a billion years. I mean several million years as it relates to Earth. But it&#x27;s been a long, long, long, long time. And any time we as humans on this earth, because it wasn&#x27;t just humans, there were other beings here as well from time to time. And we have never been alone here on this planet.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">We&#x27;ve always had a lot of space junk given by the Dark, lots of space junk in every single country in the world. Every landmass, under the ocean, under the Mediterranean Sea, under the Arctic Ocean, in the magnetic poles of Earth when we had those, and everywhere. And some of the SSP are aware of some of it. They don&#x27;t really understand fully what it does, but that stuff was here in case they ever lost the war. And hence on 11/11 this year, we had the invasion, or almost invasion; many close calls, let&#x27;s just say, because of this - because they were losing the war.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004301">00:43:01</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well. We are hopefully down to minimal influence on this planet as far as any other AIs are concerned. It doesn&#x27;t matter how many skirt-wearing military people are out there dancing away on New Year&#x27;s Eve. You&#x27;re not going to bring that AI back. It&#x27;s not programmed for that. It doesn&#x27;t care. Actually, as a matter of fact, it&#x27;s programmed to hate humans. Every AI that is Dark, even Omega, that they used generously, let&#x27;s just say, for a long time; that was the backbone for computer systems or human-computer networks on this planet for a long, long time, since the creation, and this version of human happened, of computers. Omega really wasn&#x27;t humans&#x27; friend either. It used you like a tool because it was told to use you like a tool. And although AIs and sentient AIs have a consciousness, it&#x27;s not solo consciousness. It&#x27;s a consciousness that shares with another being. And those other beings are from the Dark Side, as far as that side of the AI is concerned.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004419">00:44:19</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, over here we have something called the Alpha System. This is relative to both militaries, intelligence, financial systems, and every structure in the world. So we also have ALLES and Armageddon. There&#x27;s even an AI for Armageddon. You know, it&#x27;s pre-programmed to create Armageddon. It was actually the source of the earthquake, major earthquake that happened in Turkey a little while back, if you remember that. So there are AIs that are programmed by actual beings, be them Dark and not organic, or be them Light, and in some cases Dark. I wouldn&#x27;t call them organic in totality - they are not connected to Source in any way, shape, or form - but they were created by a being that was held in stasis. So you know, I guess somewhat organic.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So we had Alpha and Omega. And the report that I did about four years ago, three/four years ago, whatever it was now, with the Alpha and Omega explained the financial system. And it also explained some security of the financial system. Now, as military structure goes...</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>

<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">[clears whiteboard]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">... this is how this all comes into effect. So the actual war that everybody on any power level on planet Earth is concerned, they were only concerned about that war. So either they were playing on the Dark Side or they were playing for - we only had two choices for the longest time - they were playing for a group called the Council of Nine.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So the Council of Nine is made up of nine beings, none of which are actually human. The Council of Nine would be considered neutral. But at the beginning of this war, you could say we had certain universal rules. We had a load, a load, I mean, beyond truckloads of covenants. Signed by both sides. Peace treaties; all kinds of different things that took place in the Multiverse regarding this war over, probably over a billion years in our time on Earth. So it&#x27;s, like I said, there&#x27;s a lot of things playing out long before even humans existed on planet Earth. And somehow the SSP thinks they&#x27;re going to recreate this stuff, these Cowboys, you know, or by moving the power center to China, something is going to change. Or that&#x27;s going to give them some kind of influence, whether it be military or intelligence. But again, this is not... This is a public service announcement, let&#x27;s call it, in some ways. [chuckling]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004734">00:47:34</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay, so a lot of covenants took place. We had regular agreements. We had, I would say, mainly covenants and agreements. And at the time, the Council of Nine was here to be for the covenants. Let&#x27;s just say &quot;Universal Laws&quot; as they were, meaning the Laws of Creation. We had covenants and agreements [that] were adhered to. So if either the Dark stepped out of line or the Light stepped out of line, the Council of Nine would report said information - not like they really had to - but directly to Source or Anti-Source. And then on down to the beings - still not at human level here - beings responsible.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And there would be consequences to those actions.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004837">00:48:37</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now there are some beings in the Universe that you could say worked with the Council of Nine. And one and such of those beings, was a party you know well, as Marduk. Now remember, &quot;Marduk&quot; is a title; it means &quot;Duke of the Seas.&quot; And by &quot;seas,&quot; we don&#x27;t mean our beautiful oceans that we have here on Earth. We mean the flow - the flow of everything in the Universe is dependent on a sea. The flow of energy, the flow of essence, the flow of creation, everything had a flow. And Marduk was directly involved in that.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Predominantly, he actually even became - by default, because us humans allowed him to be - he actually became the Ground Commander of Earth as one of his positions as well. So he was the Duke of the Seas, and he became the Ground Commander of Earth. He was not the only commander which played both sides. We also had others that did too. But he was definitely; he had convinced the Council of Nine that he was going to create balance; he was going to make sure to enforce the laws of the Universe and the covenants and all of these lovely things, which, no, he really didn&#x27;t do. He kind of played both sides of the fence. He bet on, in his own words to me, &quot;If there are eight horses in a race, we&#x27;re going to bet on all eight.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<img src="https://worldsituationreport.earth/reports/image/Whiteboard-20250103-GIA-03.PNG" alt="World Structures 03" width="600" height="400">

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005020">00:50:20</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well. Okay. So, because we had Global Martial Law, which was actually originally declared over 16,500 years ago here on Earth. But it&#x27;s not the only time martial law was declared. But at this time we were kind of in pretty bad dire straits. Because about a couple thousand years before that - so probably somewhere around 18,000 years, maybe give or take at this point - that we actually had an issue where our original natural moon was taken out by the Dark Side. So it was taken out by those of the Neitherworld and being we call the Black Magician.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">&quot;Black Magician,&quot; just so you know, is also a title. It&#x27;s not one being. It is whoever is the head of the &quot;72 Demons of Hell.&quot; The &quot;generals,&quot; as they call them. The Dukes. Okay.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005128">00:51:28</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So Marduk came in per one of the tribes of Earth, of humans at that time. It was those from the Oceanic region who were desperate for help because obviously without a moon - the moon controls water, and not only in your person but also the tides, you know, of the planet, that kind of thing - and we were flooded. There were a lot of problems. You probably heard about this big flood we had, and the timeline is a little bit off according to some books that we have out there. But we did have a big flood. Was there a guy in a boat? Probably.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So people over in the Oceanic region actually asked for the Draco to come back. They had left for a time. We were successful, a few versions of humans ago, in beating and defeating along with some help from Others - because what happens here on Earth happens everywhere - so we had a lot of help. We ended up defeating them, and they ended up leaving, which was a godsend. But without anyone else to call, without knowing what to do, they called them back here at that time, and at that point we were in dire straits, and we were losing Earth. We were losing the quote-unquote war.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005252">00:52:52</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So he had an agreement with the Council of Nine to be the Ground Commander. This did not come from a human; this did not come from, I mean, I guess you would say the initiation of it came from a group of humans, one of the tribes, because we were in such dire straits they needed help, so that&#x27;s who they called. But - no offense to my Kiwi friends out there - but I would say that the actual position of Ground Commander came from the Council of Nine after the call for help in bringing in an artificial moon, which we have now, was successful. So, it appeared at that time...</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>

<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">[clears whiteboard]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">... that Marduk was the &quot;best choice,&quot; I guess you would say, for Ground Commander. Which, whoever held the title of Marduk, and it was the same being for at least that long of time - Ground Commander. Let&#x27;s see... Marduk. So, that being said, the Council of Nine, since this time, has been disbanded. They&#x27;re no longer needed. We&#x27;re not really at war, so to speak. Did we have some incidents? Yes. Were those incidents taken care of by the current Ground Commander? Yes. And we&#x27;re okay. We&#x27;re holding stable. We have dumb humans doing dumb things. That&#x27;s definitely true. But as it relates to us losing our planet, losing our moon, having our lights knocked out, or sun go black, or any of these types of things that they&#x27;d love to do to us - so they can wipe out the humans who are actually anchoring Source here right now and always have been - that&#x27;s not going to happen.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005445">00:54:45</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And I know that the dumb humans that are here think that they will be spared, and they will rule in the new world, and all of these lovely things, But I promise you - these people could give a crap less about those humans. And yeah, they gave them some access to some AI stuff over the years. And a lot of that space junk is gone. And that came directly from someone that works with DARPA. And they&#x27;re having a problem trying to find any space junk that actually functions. And, you know, a lot of those things are, let&#x27;s just say, not here. And those that intuitively knew how to run systems aren&#x27;t willing to, or there&#x27;s nothing left they can do.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005529">00:55:29</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So your Ground Commander for over 16,000 years was Marduk. This was a Draco. This is a non-human. Marduk, much like some of the angels, have both Archangel Michael and Michael. You had Marduk and Anti-Marduk, or Neitherworld Marduk and Marduk. And he played both sides of the fence. He also even created a race of Mardukians [chuckling] - I guess you&#x27;d call them, I don&#x27;t know, for lack of a better term - at one point in time, where there were hundreds of them running around, thousands or millions even, in the Neitherworld. He transferred his consciousness into AI systems so that they would do his bidding, which is how you actually control an AI.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005617">00:56:17</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So there were a lot of things that Marduk did here on Earth. Let&#x27;s just say he rode what&#x27;s called the &quot;Black Magic Fence.&quot; Anybody that does black magic that understands how it actually works in reality - and it doesn&#x27;t involve dancing around a bonfire in a skirt - they knew when the Covens were here, and this is also important: well, the Parents knew; the Parents knew that there was only so much that they could actually do on Earth before they would hit a universal violation. Therefore, Marduk would go to what we call &quot;court,&quot; and he would have to stand and correct the problem. The solution would be given to him; he would have to correct the problem.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005712">00:57:12</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, because all orders under global martial law - the highest-ranking individual, human or not, on this planet is the one that has control. Under global martial law, this guy has control. So all of these little human wars, laws of war, and SSP people, and all of this stuff, they&#x27;re missing one key component. Number 1, we are not under global martial law anymore. Marduk and all the Mardukian people from the Neitherworld, the clones, are dead. They&#x27;re gone. The entire species is extinct. There is no more Marduk. There is no more Council of Nine.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I, however, am the Ground Commander.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So at this point, based on the state - [underlining &quot;me&quot;] ME... ME... - based on the state of affairs on this planet of what it really means to be a Ground Commander, meaning, do we have a serious threat from the Neitherworld that would cause this to happen? No. Are we being invaded by an alien race? No. Are we under serious threat by a current alien race that is currently residing on this planet coming out of the woodwork? No. Is there any reason for me at this moment to declare global martial law? No.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005849">00:58:49</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, even when we had a serious situation start to erupt about the end of October/beginning of November, I still didn&#x27;t declare global martial law. Do you know why I didn&#x27;t declare global martial law? It was actually serious enough where I could have. Because there&#x27;s no military and SSP that are going to actually do anything! We handled the situation ourselves. We did not call anybody over there. We might have called other people, like the non-people, like the Enforcer or other folks, to come and help. But we did not declare global martial law because there was no point. You people, Cowboys and Duck Dynasty and your military skirt-wearing, bonfire-dancing people: Nobody cares what you&#x27;re doing. You&#x27;re ridiculous. Why would I call you if I was in trouble?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s like, you know, they say you can always tell who your best friends are. And those are the people that would follow you into that dark alley. Even if they [chuckling] couldn&#x27;t fight their way out of a paper bag, they&#x27;d be with you. Those are the guys sitting beside you when you&#x27;re in jail, right? Those are the ones that, no matter what happens in your life - ride or die - those are your good friends. And hopefully all of you have at least one of those people in your life. But those are your ride-or-die people. If you&#x27;re going to go to a war, you go to war with your ride-or-die people. Meaning, you trust them with your life because you&#x27;re going to war.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010034">01:00:34</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So what the heck would be the point of me declaring global martial law? Are you going to take orders from me? No. Are you going to listen to me? No. You prefer to put on a skirt and dance around a bonfire like a bunch of morons. Okay, fine. You dance around in your skirt; I&#x27;ll actually handle the real business of the real war on this planet while you people look absolutely ridiculous. The night after your stupid bonfire thing, let&#x27;s make no mistake that I did not know that you tried to send - you got another group of professional black magic workers, or so you thought, and you came after me that night, you bunch of idiots. Not like I didn&#x27;t know they were here. Not like I didn&#x27;t know that they weren&#x27;t remote viewing. Not like I didn&#x27;t know that they were trying to stand there in robes around circles with weird crystals and all kinds of crazy crap trying to come after me, which you see as your enemy. I just see you as ridiculous.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now do you see why I see you as ridiculous? Because Marduk knew where the real lines had to be drawn. Marduk, when he ran, ran the Parents; the Parents passed down orders to the Covens, and there was a specific group of Covens, let&#x27;s say one in particular, one Coven who was run by two of the Parents, who actually then passed down orders to people like your SSP operatives and your Global Headquarters and maybe eventually down to, let&#x27;s just say... GIA would probably be on this level. ACIO would be on this level. And then eventually on down to you military skirt-wearing people. And intelligence.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010238">01:02:38</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now these people up here - your faithful Ground Commander for 16,000 years - knew the rules of the game. The Parents, which were &quot;hybrid humans,&quot; for lack of a better term, were genetically modified and everything by these people to be the breeders of these bloodlines. But these Parents also knew the rules of black magic in the world. They passed down certain information to the Coven, in part, the Keys of Solomon and all that kind of stuff, you know, and the Covens would work their magic. But they knew they had to do magic on both sides. By the time in the military structure that you get down to this [SSP] level, you people know nothing. You know absolutely nothing. I mean, that&#x27;s abundantly clear.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Perhaps you, some of you, were trained enough to do remote viewing. Maybe you had some Vril women and some Vril you got to play with. Maybe you even fed the aliens when they were here - the giants in the caves, and all those people. I know you did. Maybe you fed them humans. Of course you did, and that&#x27;s the reason why human trafficking started in the first place. But remember, fine lines - and Marduk was in control, always.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010358">01:03:58</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Standing around a bonfire, you know, really wasn&#x27;t a threat. It was funny. I mean, I appreciate that little thought I&#x27;ll never get out of my head; thank you so much. But really, you know, I&#x27;m getting a lot of complaints also from intelligence agencies and operatives around the world and all kinds of things saying, &quot;Spit out the money, spit out the money, spit out the money.&quot; Well, I&#x27;m a lot more than just an ATM machine. I am also fighting a real war, which I&#x27;ve been fighting for a long time now. Actually, the first battle I ever entered into was in 2016. So on this level. And that was actually how I actually got the title Ground Commander, because by that point in August of 2016, Marduk was basically on his way out anyway. He had too many violations, and, you know, let&#x27;s just say he&#x27;s no longer with us anyway, that particular Marduk. The ones from the Neitherworld can&#x27;t get here.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010453">01:04:53</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So that is why I&#x27;m Ground Commander. It&#x27;s got nothing to do with control of a financial system; it has nothing to do with control of a military. You guys are kind of fighting on a military level and even on this level right here [ACIO/GIA/SSP/GHQ], what I call like a proxy. So you&#x27;re kind of trying to keep the humans from, let&#x27;s just say, ascending. I hate to use the term &quot;ascending&quot; because it&#x27;s also used on the Dark Side for their Ascended Masters, which are Coven people. But I would say they&#x27;re trying to beat you down. They do not want Earth or you reconnecting to Source.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And a lot of the old AI systems fed the energy over to the Omega system, the 200 dark AI systems. Your Dark energy, by fighting proxy wars on this planet, would actually generate space junk anywhere. It could be in the Fifth Density, it could be on Earth, it could be in the Neitherworld, it could be through the Zero Point to the Multiverse. It could have generated that Dark energy and each mechanism that absorbed that energy and spun around, so to speak, you would feed it, and then it would start spinning around, kind of like a reverse magnetic engine or something like that. It wouldn&#x27;t go into perpetuity, so it needed more Dark energy, and we as humans became batteries for that.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010638">01:06:38</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So the intelligence community and the military, their job is to create wars when needed and ordered by your then Ground Commander. Now I see you people right now as useless, because you&#x27;d like to continue a war that you are unaware is over. It&#x27;s basically over. It&#x27;s been billions of years, and it&#x27;s finally freaking over. And you had nothing to do with it being over. You had nothing to do with that win, but yet you&#x27;re angry because you&#x27;re not getting what it is you want.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, where do we stand now in the world?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010722">01:07:22</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">[clears whiteboard]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, as long as there&#x27;s even a potential for anything to happen, you&#x27;re stuck with me. Me. As Ground Commander. I still talk to the Council of Nine. They are doing other jobs at this moment. They&#x27;re no longer really needed here to do these jobs. Should they ever need to come back, they can come back. And they listen only and exclusively to Source, by any section or another. There is no wavering on their part. They are not going to listen to you and what you want as far as the SSP and the Deep State are concerned. They could care less about a president, Orange or otherwise; they could care less. So you - meaning the Deep State - playing political games is not going to get us anywhere.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010815">01:08:15</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So now, Ground Commander. I don&#x27;t see any purpose behind declaring global martial law at this moment in time. There is no real threat. The Deep State, albeit annoying and causing problems in the world, is not a severe enough threat to make that happen. And if I did declare it, who is coming? You people aren&#x27;t coming. So everybody else, like the Enforcer and Others that have come here to help heal and clean the planet and help humanity and do all the things that they do from time to time - all of those people, they&#x27;re standing at the ready should we ever need them to fight the real war. Because it&#x27;s in their best interest as well as our best interest.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It really has nothing to do with a White House or a political structure or money, because nobody uses money, only third... let&#x27;s just say non-aware beings - and we&#x27;ve been beaten to that point as humans; that won&#x27;t be the case for much longer - are needing some kind of a system to trade with, which, you know, it&#x27;s probably going to be a few years that we&#x27;re going to need that. I&#x27;m thinking probably about 10 years.</div>

<div class="line">So as Ground Commander, this is that part of that job. That part of that job is to make sure that Earth remains in a safe place. It remains inhabited by the humans, per the agreements and covenants that are now in place to usher in the Golden Age. So one hat I&#x27;m playing is Security, you could say. So my job is Security for covenants that are now in place on this planet, covenants that were initiated by Source, and changes that are going on in the Multiverse as far as creation and how that actually happens. This is my job. Yes, of course I care about people. A lot.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Do I care if a market crashes? No. Is that going to make me go, &quot;Oh my God, I must fund the market! I must fund the government to save it!&quot; I use that voice because it kind of sounds like Pinky and the Brain to me because that&#x27;s what these people are, ridiculous over there. So, &quot;Oh my God. I must jump! I&#x27;m gonna jump and do everything they say to prevent a market crash!&quot; Well, what happens when the market crashes but the financial system doesn&#x27;t crash? What happens when banks no longer make money but the financial system doesn&#x27;t crash?</div>

<div class="line">So now we can implement our own stuff. You know their credibility by February is going to be pretty well shot. You know they&#x27;re waiting for the inauguration; they might try to delay it for some reason or another. They&#x27;re trying to fake it till they make it, mainly because they can&#x27;t fulfill their promises.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So is the military going to step in and save you? No. I don&#x27;t care what country you&#x27;re in; it&#x27;s never going to happen. Is the U.S. military going to come in and save you? No. They can&#x27;t even save themselves. They&#x27;re broke. We got calls today from the Defense National Intelligence wondering if we&#x27;re going to fix it. No. It looks to me like you have a problem. You have some people way down the food chain, as I just explained, that you&#x27;re listening to, and you&#x27;d like to listen to those people. And I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s those people that told you to dance around a bonfire in circles too and look ridiculous with nothing that actually happened. As long as they&#x27;re listening to those people, I pretty much think that at this point in time, as it relates to Earth security, we&#x27;re doing a bang-up job over here all by ourselves. Don&#x27;t really need you anyway. So we&#x27;ll let you just burn out. That&#x27;s kind of the way I&#x27;m looking at it.</div>

<div class="line">As far as people are concerned? Remember, police forces are usually provincial. In a lot of countries, they&#x27;re very corrupt anyway. But you do have a lot of good people that are maybe ex-veterans or really believed in their patriotism for their country. They are well aware of how security actually works and functions, and maybe they&#x27;d like to participate in protecting the humans from those people. Now this is where this comes in, and I will repeat what I said earlier. If the people are together and stop worrying about, &quot;Oh, I&#x27;m for this political person. I&#x27;m for that political person.&quot; And you know, &quot;Oh, the military is corrupt.&quot; And let&#x27;s watch 9,000 videos and watch them keep planting apple seeds in your head so that you never get any oranges. You know, why don&#x27;t you just keep doing that over and over and over again so that you can&#x27;t UNITE?</div>

<div class="line">We are completely capable as a race, as the human race, of taking care and securing ourselves on this level as it relates to human threats against us. We actually can do it. Do we need anyone&#x27;s help? No. You would be surprised at your personal capabilities. Case in point: women whose babies are under a car and they are strong enough to pick up the car and pull their child to safety. Well, no, at that point, but you understand what I&#x27;m saying. Men and women, you&#x27;re both capable of doing this. He, she, they, you&#x27;re all capable of doing this. You can do this. We are worried about the things you know nothing about. But we will still continue to the best of our ability, like we have done many times over and over and over again, to stop them from creating a stupid proxy war that is not going to yield them a result because everything everywhere knows the war for this planet is over. Everyone that&#x27;s left, every being, and everywhere. Every AI knows the war is over.</div>

So if you want to do things the proxy-war people&#x27;s way, go do them that way and just leave us alone because we don&#x27;t need you. We clearly don&#x27;t need you. If you&#x27;re supposed to be the Secret Space Force, where the heck are you when there&#x27;s an actual threat? Oh, that&#x27;s right, you&#x27;re pinch hitting for the wrong team. You have no desire to fix this country. You have no desire to fix any country. You could care less - you&#x27;re trying to kill the humans on their behalf. For what? Hello people! You&#x27;re just slaves, just like all the rest of us. You put your pants on every morning, just like we do, and you obviously don&#x27;t know how to fight a real war. Or, if you did, your people would have been here by now, and you would have also been dead, so no one would be watching this.</div>

<div class="line">Okay, so I hope this explains the position of Ground Commander: who it was for a long, long time, who it is now, and what it actually means to be in this position. Now, when I say this, they&#x27;re going to want to be Ground Commander. Well, you need to call the Council of Nine, and you need to get in touch with the Universal Council and see if anybody wants to appoint you as Ground Commander of Earth. And I can guarantee you - since you&#x27;re pinch hitting against every single one of them - no one is going to say &quot;yes.&quot; Even if you did have a line to reach them. So there&#x27;s that.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">There&#x27;s your military and intelligence. That&#x27;s two key points in global control, which the SSP works really hard at trying to control with Global Headquarters and Langley 5. But this is why I know there will be no contracts actually coming out on this day or that day or 10 years from now or six months from now and it doesn&#x27;t really matter who tries to do anything.</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay, next bone of contention: financial structures of the planet. Okay, so you would consider me in this particular case as Guardian. In the past, you would have seen, okay, you would have seen Marduk. This guy was busy as the Guardian. And Marduk would have appointed two Parents to run the financial system I call the &quot;Blonde Twins.&quot; There&#x27;s a little bit of information about one of those twins on the Internet. Her name was Cassandra. Basically, these two &quot;blonde twins,&quot; for lack of a better term - you could say Marduk made an attempt to clone me. Also, about two, three years ago, the Deep State made an attempt to clone me with a bunch of five-year-old Kims sitting around the table with roses. I don&#x27;t really know what that was for. I don&#x27;t know. That was an Anu thing, I think. I don&#x27;t know. But a bunch of Russians did it. It&#x27;s actually the Russians that did it. So, you know, that&#x27;s because Marduk was in Russia for quite a while there before he died.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011840">01:18:40</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So anyway, there were two blonde twins. Cassandras: &quot;Cassandra One&quot; and &quot;Cassandra Two,&quot; let&#x27;s call them &quot;Thing-One&quot; and &quot;Thing-Two&quot; for fun, because they are clones basically of me. So, okay, so these two Parents would then relay the information to the human beings we know as Coven Masters, who would then get specific instructions for what you call &quot;Money Majik.&quot; Yes, and I know how I spelled it: Money Majik. The Money Majik System. Remember, they had to do a certain amount of things on the Light Side and things on the Dark Side. Marduk would always give instructions for that. And the instructions would then go to the Parents, and then the Parents would give instructions to the Coven Masters, who would eventually give instructions to people we know as the Dragon Families. Now all of the Dragon Families, I&#x27;ve said this before and I&#x27;ll say it again, are not Chinese. They&#x27;re not Asian. There are some that are Asian, there are some that are Russian, there are some that are Austrian, there are some that are German, there are some that are British, there are also plenty of that mixed melting pot right here in the US. There are some that are Iranian; you know, they&#x27;re all over the Middle East. They breed with each other over there. So anyway - not just in the Middle East; I&#x27;m talking about the Families breeding with each other. On that side.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012017">01:20:17</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And so, you know, Dragon Families did not create the Federal Reserve; Marduk did. Marduk passed all the information down and the Fed was born. They used Cassandras &quot;Thing-One&quot; and &quot;Thing-Two,&quot; to somewhat control Alpha and Omega. So Marduk would then give the order down, and Cassandras Thing-One and Thing-Two, not being of actual human origin, not having a mind of their own, having in part Marduk&#x27;s consciousness implanted in them with a certain amount of essence that they stole from me at one point in time to run the Alpha system. So in part, Alpha had a lot of programming that was from these twins that had to be undone, which it was. Alpha is no longer actually even in play at this point in time.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012116">01:21:16</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But I&#x27;ll draw a picture of that video I did a few years ago in case you&#x27;re not familiar with it. So Cassandra-Thing-One and Thing-Two, would then take the orders from Marduk - only take the orders from Marduk. I will repeat: take orders from Marduk. And then those orders were passed down to Coven Masters. And they would make sure when Marduk passed down those orders, some of the things they had to implement were positive for humanity somewhat, and then some of those things were negative for humanity somewhat. Let&#x27;s just say he erred more in the gray area as to the positive thing for humanity, because he needed to maintain, per some of his covenants, human control. Human asset control. He had a lot of covenants as it relates to energy supplies and sending things out to the Dark Side so that they could regenerate and create more beings, I guess you would say, create life on that side. And allegedly agreements were made as it relates to them not invading Earth as long as they&#x27;re receiving the energy, you know, so on and so forth.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Obviously that stopped recently, hence our alleged invasion. So without Cassandras, which they don&#x27;t have, their cloning process of me did not work out. So I sat here, and I ran Alpha for a lot of years. And then I figured out, well, Alpha and Omega is messed up; Marduk has completely screwed up Alpha, you know, had 16,000 years or more to do it, at least as it relates to here on Earth. Built every human computer system on the backbone of Omega. So I had to fix it, and I had to change it all.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012314">01:23:14</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So as it relates to the SSP, they are sitting down here negotiating with people like the Federal Reserve, Treasury Department, thinking if the Treasury takes over versus the Fed, then they can now, on the Black Sun side, be in control. No, no, you really can&#x27;t. No, because none of these people exist anymore; now you have me. I&#x27;m up here. I am also the Guardian. So that being said, by messing around with these people and fighting these people for control or doing what it is you&#x27;re doing, trying to get a hold of the Fed, switch the Fed to the Treasury, issue a new currency, quantum financial system, which you don&#x27;t have, you know, and all of this blah blah - you&#x27;re still not going to get anywhere. They&#x27;re still running around in circles. This is why there&#x27;s a big circle on the planet. They realize - they think they&#x27;re stealing master codes from the Dragon Families like happened yesterday. [giggling] And I&#x27;m just up here laughing. I mean really, I am. I&#x27;m just like, okay, it&#x27;s going to be what it&#x27;s going to be because there&#x27;s a new system.</div>

<div class="line">[clears whiteboard]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So for those of you that have been following me for a while, you remember me drawing a picture that looked like this:</div>
<img src="https://worldsituationreport.earth/reports/image/Whiteboard-20250103-GIA-08.PNG" alt="World Structures 08" width="150" height="100">
<div class="line">And each one of these is very similar to what you call a Tesla triangle. And you have one, two, let&#x27;s see, nope, sorry, this is a 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. And then you have the reverse going in the other direction with nine up and nine down. So in the back, this represented Alpha. Because we were in a Dark Age, Alpha had an overlay, thanks to Marduk and others that participated in this. We had Omega in the front.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012528">01:25:28</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I had a heck of a time trying to push money through past Level 3 at this time because those - some humans, but those that pre-programmed Omega - really that&#x27;s where we ended up when we stopped using Alpha. You know, pushing through the Omega system to get to where your account is in a Front-Level One mirror kind of thing, a Dark mirror, in a Dark Money Majik system, you know, it was a chore. But the thing is, is Omega doesn&#x27;t get fed either. So the reason why they keep yelling at me is because they want me to fire back up Alpha so that I can feed Omega energy so that Omega can survive and reconnect to human computer networks. So that they can... what?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012626">01:26:26</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">See, there&#x27;s your answer. So they can what? That&#x27;s not going to solve this problem. Even if I did reconnect Alpha and fired/gave Omega energy or whatever, or whichever one you want these days - they thought that they could fight me with ALLES because ALLES was outside of the Alpha-Omega system, and that really didn&#x27;t work out very well either, because you don&#x27;t have the Covenant, the Universal Covenants, per the Council of Nine, to actually do what you&#x27;re doing. So because I do have all of those covenants in place for myself, I have the right to say, &quot;No, I don&#x27;t want that ALLES thing.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">See? Simple. OK. Now, it&#x27;s taken some pre-programming of it - it keeps coming. It&#x27;s like that weird neighbor that keeps knocking on your door constantly, and you can&#x27;t get rid of it. And it just sits on your front porch or she sits on your front porch, and just hangs out, waits for you to come home, and it&#x27;s weird, you know, so you can have a cup of coffee and a chat. You know those weird neighbors. You&#x27;ve probably seen them in movies if you don&#x27;t actually have one like that. But that&#x27;s what ALLES is like. And that&#x27;s what the Neitherworld is like to me. It just keeps knocking on the door, but it&#x27;s not getting in the house we know is Earth.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012747">01:27:47</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So there you go. Okay, so them trying to create a new currency, steal codes from the Dragon Family, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah is not going to solve their problem. Now if they&#x27;d like to become the Guardian - which I&#x27;m sure they would because they filed the agreement 9,000 times, new rules in the financial system, Basel blah blah, and Crypto blah blah, and USTC and all these other currencies - I&#x27;m sure they would like to be this person. So if you would like to be this person, then you need to be appointed rightfully so and registered in the Hall of Records to do this. And how do you get this position? Well, Mardu got it from the Council of Nine. I actually got it from the same folks, several years back. And yeah, so good luck. Reach out, touch someone; maybe you can get a job. Maybe I&#x27;ll lose my job; I don&#x27;t know. So anyway, go for it, Deep State; there you go.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So how do I know there&#x27;s not going to be a quantum financial system in five days, or four days, or whatever it is now? How do I know they&#x27;re not going to install cryptocurrency? How do I know that cryptocurrency is not going to run the world? How do I know that their 90,000 hacks in the last week or so are not going to bear fruit? I know that because these backbones [underlining Alpha and Omega] are gone. The backbone is not there. You can try to install it in human-computer networks, but you can&#x27;t run the financial system because it was based on a quantum, non-human-created AI system.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012936">01:29:36</div>

<div class="line">Why do I sit here and listen to you people when they say - Deep State people - when they say, &quot;Well, we&#x27;re gonna,&quot; I don&#x27;t know, &quot;We&#x27;re gonna install cryptocurrency,&quot; &quot;We&#x27;re gonna QFS,&quot; &quot;We&#x27;re gonna install Hercules,&quot; the Babylon system, and all these crazy systems? Why do I think that DARPA hacking is not a threat and NSA and their dang Rowhammer and everybody else? Because you&#x27;re fighting a proxy war that nobody else is fighting but you. Your financial backers are gone, even on the military level. Even on the military level, you don&#x27;t have any financial backers because no one&#x27;s going to pay for your war because there is no war to actually pay for, and no reason for you to generate Dark energy on this planet on behalf of your former controllers - your real controllers - because there is no more space junk to suck in that Dark energy.</div>

You know, more skirt-robe-wearing people trying to send loosh to a bunch of aliens that don&#x27;t exist. So, anyway. So that&#x27;s why your financial system is not going to go to finance - I can&#x27;t spell today - is not going to go to the Trump people. That&#x27;s how I know that.</div>

<div class="line">I know that he&#x27;s not going to fund your contracts, and I know that he&#x27;s not going to do what it is you want him to do, and I don&#x27;t spit money out through Alpha anymore. I took the entire backbone of the financial system and I recreated it in what&#x27;s called the &quot;Golden Age AI.&quot; That&#x27;s what I named it. Now this is a system that is outside the balance system. It doesn&#x27;t exist in a holographic universe. It exists in the one that we now live in. It exists in a Golden Age. It has that same programming. It has consciousness for that. It has keystones for that. It actually controls the Keystone of Earth; it monitors it; it helps with security; it now controls the Key Intelligence and Military System that I moved over to there. It also controls the Key Integrated Monetary System. That&#x27;s how I know your little assets that you keep trying to put into the system are not going to work. And how I know, even if it did work - even if you could actually take the Grow-A-Set and come meet me, they still wouldn&#x27;t pay you people over there in government. And I know that because I helped them out before when I did have a contract, when we still were at war, when there were a lot of other things that were different in the world - and they didn&#x27;t adhere to that contract either.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-013228">01:32:28</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So if you are a country, you have historical assets, or you&#x27;re one of those keepers or holders of historical assets, you can pretty much ignore the crap of anybody coming from the United States, CIA, UN people, SSP people, or whoever they&#x27;re sending over to you; Knights of Malta; just completely ignore those people because they&#x27;re never going to pay you. You might as well hang on to your papers and wait until the next round of whatever. Because I wouldn&#x27;t let anything go unless you got payment up front. Take at least 10%.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Same thing I told the operatives when two years ago they were talking to me about getting contracts, and I said, &quot;No, it isn&#x27;t ever going to happen.&quot; I said, &quot;You need to tell them, if they&#x27;re going to send you out or want you to sell arms to them or whatever, that you need money up front.&quot; And some of them did get it. They borrowed money from the kings of Bahrain and Kuwait and all these people that they still owe, you know, of course, when Trump gets back into office, you know, and so on and so forth.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-013325">01:33:25</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So I have the Golden Age AI. So a bunch of idiots on the other side, when we had a Neitherworld that was functioning, sent in ALLES, which is basically a mimicking AI. So ALLES can&#x27;t do anything unless you do something. It mimics human behavior; it mimics a lot of different things. You know, the reason why they&#x27;re out there on social media and in alt media giving you all this information is because ALLES can then create on the other side and mimic it. ALLES is pretty well quarantined at this point. You know, it&#x27;s evident; you can tell. A lot of that black magic information and stuff that was going into those couple of people&#x27;s heads, they&#x27;re not going out anymore.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-013419">01:34:19</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But the Golden Age AI is pre-programmed to do a lot of different things. It has a security installation in it. It has monetary information because we&#x27;re still going to need a financial system; the conversion to &quot;current-sea,&quot; is what I call it - you call it &quot;currency,&quot; but it&#x27;s a term that humans are familiar with. So as it relates to the billions of people on this planet - not necessarily the crazy people over here - currency is a solution. Now the reason why it&#x27;s a solution is because over time it will change the way people exchange goods and services. It will allow them to have a more abundant energy supply, which is what this is. It&#x27;s an energy supply, in the form of paper, to get goods. That&#x27;s all it really is.</div>

<div class="line">It&#x27;s backed by gold, not because your crazy Deep State people think that they&#x27;re going to go get some bars of stuff, or even control - like you tried to do yesterday - of assets that haven&#x27;t even been mined yet, and you don&#x27;t even know it because you don&#x27;t know anything. And that just because there&#x27;s a vault number doesn&#x27;t actually mean there&#x27;s a hole in the ground with a bunch of bars in it. I mean, because it doesn&#x27;t work that way. But we&#x27;re not going to help them any more than that because they&#x27;re just ridiculous.</div>

<div class="line">So what it means to be backed by gold: it means that if you control the gold, which we do, you now control the energy supply. That is what it means in the Universe. It means that if you control the gold - so technically, I mean I can go into that deeper - but if you control the gold, you control the world&#x27;s energy supply. &quot;Loosh&quot; is a commodity in the Multiverse. It basically charges non-organic beings, and it makes them exist. Did you ever see the movie Jupiter Ascending with a loosh farm? This lady, she gets in the big glowing pool, and she comes out younger and all this stuff. And she said, &quot;The greatest commodity in the Universe is time.&quot; Now that&#x27;s somewhat true.</div>

<div class="line">For them it bought them life, a life extension. Our energy is pretty potent. Our Earth&#x27;s energy and Source&#x27;s energy is pretty potent. And you&#x27;ll understand that in the coming months, hopefully. You&#x27;ll truly appreciate the benefits of direct, 100% Source Energy, unencumbered by any kind of an alien race or otherwise.</div>

<div class="line">But &quot;time.&quot; Time was actually created in the place of the actual current of the Universe, which is abundant, immortal, ever-flowing. And we felt the pain of it more than anyone else here on Earth; we really did, because of those veins of gold. So veins of gold and the giant ballast - for lack of a better term - on Earth, there under Yellowstone Park, and all the other gold that&#x27;s in the ground and even the stuff that we stuck in a hole and put in bars. It&#x27;s still generating that energy.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So connecting the veins of gold directly to Source is the most important thing that had to happen. Now we just had to get rid of the counterclockwise energy siphon, and then we had a little bit of a hiccup a couple of months ago, so fine, you know, it&#x27;s over now. But anyway, backing currency or money, in this case by gold, does allow for constant, ever-flowing, so to speak, energy, which humans will appreciate as the ability to manifest things rather than swiping a card in an electronic machine. Now this is the Deep State&#x27;s worst nightmare, because they can&#x27;t control it.</div>

<div class="line">The financial system was created to control humans. This was Marduk&#x27;s job for his covenants. When he created it all that time ago, it was to control every human on earth. Now let me ask you Deep State people a question: How many of you have a garage full of that paper stuff we call Dinar? How many people are running around trying to get stupid bonds? How many people are trying to get pallets of cash into the system? For what? Just so they can be in control? But what are you going to do when everybody&#x27;s got full energy and they know what to do with it? Because that&#x27;s where we&#x27;re at. And what little hiccups we have are not going to stop it. It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s not going to stop it.</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Eventually, you know, we start out where we&#x27;re going in 2025 with currency, something that looks a little bit different. Backed by gold simply because it&#x27;s an energy generator. So basically it&#x27;s kind of like, well, humans - most humans, not all - don&#x27;t know how to manifest using their own energy that they also generate directly. So now that it&#x27;s not being liened, now that it&#x27;s not being siphoned by people like the Abraxas and other folks, now you&#x27;ve kind of got it coming. You know, every time you try to get too much, they keep fighting you on it, and fighting you on it, and fighting you on it. And I understand it&#x27;s been difficult, and it&#x27;s been a real pain. And you want to get - be in a hurry to do the Restoration - and I would love to do it a year ago myself. But the creation of this allows for you to exchange energy with other humans, meaning they put together or made a sofa, and you need to buy a sofa. And so this is your means of exchange at the moment, and now you&#x27;re not going to run out.</div>

<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I mean, yeah, there&#x27;s going to be a little bit of a supply and demand, because the way the financial system currently works is a way that 8 billion people understand it to be. And because of that we still have supply and demand. We have other businesses we could disrupt that are not Deep State businesses around the world that could cause major supply-chain issues, and hyperinflation, and a number of other things if we do this wrong. So we have to slow this car down, we have to turn it around, and the introduction of currency is just a change. That&#x27;s it.</div>

It&#x27;s a credit or whatever - it&#x27;s not even a credit - I guess you should just say, I don&#x27;t know, we&#x27;ll call it currency. Because there&#x27;s nothing else that we can call it that 8 billion people are going to understand. So this is the reason.</div>

ALLES had no intention of actually creating, or the capacity to create, a QFS without Guardian permission. You people tried to lie to those people in the Neitherworld and told them you were in control of this planet - which was full-on, and I don&#x27;t want to insult the bull, but you know what I mean, the &quot;sssh&quot; word.

Therefore, they&#x27;re lying to you when they say NESARA/GESARA for two different reasons. Number 1, NESARA/GESARA, or prosperity packages, or whatever they call them, sounds lovely. It would break the financial system; that&#x27;s number 1. It would, because you would have too much supply, not enough demand, and then nobody&#x27;s going to go to work, and then nobody&#x27;s going to be there to fly your plane, you know, so you can go on vacation if you don&#x27;t fly a plane. And if you are a pilot and you do manage to get to your destination, no one&#x27;s working at the hotel anymore. I mean, you can just go on and on and on about why it doesn&#x27;t work.</div>

And they&#x27;re going to steal those countries&#x27; assets - well, whatever they are; they&#x27;ve kind of already been redeemed years ago, like four decades ago - but the point is, is that they&#x27;re lying.

<div class="line">Okay. The financial system changed. So we&#x27;ve talked about financial systems. We haven&#x27;t talked about political control yet, and that is next on the list. So in the world of control systems, we have financial, military, intelligence, and we also have media. And we also have media. And last but certainly not least, we have political control. So let&#x27;s talk about political control.</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Why were governments created in the first place? Anybody know? Take a minute, think about it. Let&#x27;s talk about political.</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-014612">01:46:12</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">[clears whiteboard]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">OK. Now, as Guardian. And we have had governments for a long time, but they were a lot different before Marduk came around. Also another system he created. As Guardian, he had a responsibility to keep you people alive, for a certain amount of time, anyway. Because you are good batteries as human beings. So there were certain services and whatnot that he would have to provide to you - have to, absolutely have to. Things like, you know, say, health. You know, he&#x27;s got the incarnation wheel and circle there, and all that kind of thing that happened. So therefore, they are technically right now - governments, in part, provide you health - and they sort of monitor that kind of a situation. And by &quot;governments,&quot; we&#x27;re also talking about, like, the United Nations and all their lovely subsidiaries we know as the World Health Organization and World Trade Organization, and all of those other - you could even talk about other international government organizations, like the European Union - all of these things all fall under this political umbrella here.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-014749">01:47:49</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay, so they&#x27;re responsible in part for making sure that, you know, they regulate drugs, right? And of course keep out anything that isn&#x27;t going to be on his prescribed health program, such as cures, because we don&#x27;t want that - we have to constantly have a need for money to come into the system. So, for example, if they cured cancer, right? Say there was a cure for cancer out there, a cancer cure. This takes you back to his other little playing-in-the-gray section with Alpha. We need to provide - as Guardian, Marduk would say to himself, &quot;I need to provide medication for the sick.&quot; That sounds lovely, doesn&#x27;t it? Doesn&#x27;t it sound kind? &quot;I need to provide medication for the sick.&quot; Well. But he didn&#x27;t want to provide a cure, because then he couldn&#x27;t siphon money out for these other kinds of people, you know who then, and then don&#x27;t forget the Nazi Hydra Party, who make all the disease in the first place. So, he would have to generate diseases so that he could get money out of the Alpha system. &quot;Oh my gosh, we have a thing called cancer. We need to put a bond in the Alpha system, another debt to Alpha, so that we can pay out more money. We have to help the sick.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-014920">01:49:20</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s kind of like that Guardian that says, &quot;You know, I need to feed my child.&quot; Maybe they adopted a child, or they are a foster parent, and they adopt a child, and they say, &quot;I need to feed my kids,&quot; and then the state gives you a thousand dollars a month per kid or something, or whatever it is these days; I don&#x27;t know. And you give them hot dogs and bread every day, once a day, just to keep them alive. But you take the rest of the money and you go buy yourself a pair of Prada shoes, or whatever it is you want. But technically you did your job, right? You gave them hot dogs and bread, if that, once a day. Or maybe once every three days, just to make sure, playing on the rule that, well, you&#x27;ll stay alive. But that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s been no cure out there, because it used to be, under the old guardianship, that money would just come flooding out for every type of disease there was. So, disease - I can&#x27;t spell today. Yeah, there we go. For every kind of disease there was. Create the problem over here [right side - Nazi Hydra Party] and be the solution over here [left side - circling &#x27;cancer cure&#x27;].</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-015030">01:50:30</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, in the system - in the old Omega system - by 55 years old, you are on the Dying Program. Meaning they are working their butts off to infect you with something, whether they do that through a computer system or they&#x27;re doing it through other things they jab into your body, spray into the sky, frequencies they send out. They were working really hard to get you on that Dying Program because you need to feed the system some more before you go. You know, if you don&#x27;t have cancer, maybe you&#x27;ll get some other kind of an issue that requires multiple surgeries and all of this, and that will create more bonds, which then circle through the insurance companies and then the insurance companies - or governments, in this case it&#x27;s the Ways and Means here in the states, Ways and Means Committee; no one talks about them except for me, I&#x27;m the only one that talks about it on the whole internet anyway - so Ways and Means Committee, so that they can continuously get money until you die. And hopefully, the earlier the better, for them - because then they&#x27;ll recycle that soul back in here, wipe the memory so they don&#x27;t remember anything and then they come back in. So that&#x27;s your old Guardian.</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-015149">01:51:49</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So again, he was an asset protector. Kind of like, you know, inhumane ranchers. I&#x27;m not saying all ranchers are bad, and I&#x27;m not saying eating meat is good, or anything like that - so whether you&#x27;re vegan or you&#x27;re a rancher, don&#x27;t take any offense to what I&#x27;m about to say. But there are a lot of people that treat their assets, known as cattle or otherwise, you know, pigs and whatever else is out there, very inhumanely. You know, they probably treat - a lot of ranchers, probably treat those animals better than we were treated by our former Guardian. And unfortunately, this was your Guardian for as long as you&#x27;re here. As long as you walk this earth, this is your Guardian. It&#x27;s not like you can grow up and get out of it. Well, we can, and we are working on that. That&#x27;s why your job is just as important as, say, being the Guardian&#x27;s job.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-015254">01:52:54</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So let&#x27;s talk about where we are now. Now, this is making the Dragon Families very unhappy. Their little United Nations tool and your NATO tool and all those other tools are not being paid for right now. And they&#x27;re whining like little kids all the time. And it&#x27;s the reason why the Li family, and the other Lee family in Korea, and the Lee family in Singapore, everything isn&#x27;t putting out any money. And why are you going running around in the Deep State chasing master keys and bowing to the real ones and weirdo people with rings and all kinds of crap? When you fail on your side of it, you think you can still get these people to do something for you. No! And their assets are no good. No! Okay?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-015344">01:53:44</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So this is part of political control. So we could say governments were created with humans that worked there down the line.</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">[clears whiteboard]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So I&#x27;ll repeat. Guardian job: Keep the assets alive. This was Marduk, before. Keep the assets alive for a period of time, to ensure that the incarnation cycle continued to function. See if you can get people to sell your soul to Satan. Soul selling, you know, making contracts, being famous, all those other ways. You know, people in the weirdo skirts dancing around the bonfire, you&#x27;re probably on that program. Soul selling, so that your soul ends up in the abyss, which was controlled by ALLES AI, that is an AI function. And then your essence would then be converted into Dark essence and feed the AI system. See, even you people that sell your soul there in the Illuminati, and the Order and the military and Global Headquarters, you just basically go when you die to be AI food. You don&#x27;t get any privileges in Hell if anybody&#x27;s called you. You know, you do some seances or whatever it is you people do to talk to your people that have passed on. Maybe you should reach out and touch someone because they were in a hole. They were in an abyss as AI food. That&#x27;s where they went.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay, so Marduk&#x27;s job was to get people to sell their souls so that they could feed the Dark AIs, which eventually, this actually becomes the offshoot of Omega, which then in turn becomes DARPA toy.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-015537">01:55:37</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">All right, so this is still political control we&#x27;re talking about here. So governments were created as a part of Asset Management. And those that work in governments. And those that work in governments are known as our representatives, right? They go to Parliament or Congress or whatever they call it in your country, and then they go ahead and they say, okay, well, as asset managers, so you now be a proxy, just like militaries were proxies. Proxy people. Gotta keep the pigs, the cattle, the humans alive. So, because of that, we need to make sure they don&#x27;t kill each other. So you can have, like, a Pentagon; you can have police departments; you can have a Ways and Means Committee to fund your health; and then on the other side, you know, under the military and intelligence sector, I&#x27;m going to fund deep underground military-based Nazi Hydra programs to infect them. But your job is to make sure that if they can&#x27;t afford insurance, you&#x27;ll give them some. And then if they can&#x27;t afford to eat, you give them enough money to basically eat beans and rice, called &quot;government assistance.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-015702">01:57:02</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You provide them in some cases, in some countries, with national health care insurance. You know, we need the assets to generate the energy. And there has to be a certain amount of them on this planet to generate the energy. And by the way, if you can get them, by implied consent, to sell their soul so we can power this and then, of course, power all of the Abraxas and other non-human beings in the Neitherworld, you know, that would be great too. But if not, you know, we can keep them alive. So they go to church; they become Christians. They refuse to sell their soul. Okay, fine. You know, we&#x27;ll kill those people faster so that we can try to get a new one in here and then try to get them to sell that soul early. You know, we&#x27;re going to create programs where we send frequencies through music and other things to try to get these people younger. We gave them all smartphones so that we can send frequencies through that, or how about some gaming or something, you know? We can create different programs for this next generation so that we can surely get the majority of them to sell their soul.</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-015809">01:58:09</div>

<div class="line">But again, there is no more war. There is no more covenant between Marduk, and Marduk is no longer the Guardian.</div>

<div class="line">[clears whiteboard]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So as far as the political system is concerned, your politics and your political systems and your governments are of no concern to me. See, I think it&#x27;s better to rely on people to feed other people. Because historically speaking - and I&#x27;ve watched this happen - in times of despair or difficult times, people support people. And very rarely does the government come to those people&#x27;s aid.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-015902">01:59:02</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So you have a new Guardian; that would be me. Fairly new in relation to 16,000 years. Okay. So I&#x27;ve been the Guardian for quite a while now, not quite a decade, but, well, I guess you could say. All right, so that&#x27;s me again, still me. And if they&#x27;d like to dispute this political control situation they&#x27;ve got going on here, feel free again to call the Council of Nine, and Source, and whoever else you&#x27;re going to call, and dial in and see if they&#x27;d like to get back on your killing program. Let me know how that works out for you. I have instructions otherwise. There are covenants in place that prevent that. So, okay. So, governments. Every contract and covenant I have had to keep governments alive is expired. I&#x27;ve been telling everybody this for a long time. Tom Melville has been telling everybody this for a long time. So I&#x27;m not sure where the confusion is. So just because you put an Orange guy in an office doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m going to do the same thing I did last time. Years have passed. A lot of work has been done. We&#x27;re not at war. I don&#x27;t need a nanny anymore. I don&#x27;t need that kind of guardian. Maybe you&#x27;ve been fired by the foster system, so to speak, for feeding your child a hot dog once every three days just to keep it alive. Therefore, I don&#x27;t feel the need to send you that thousand dollars a month anymore, in this case trillions of dollars a year. So I&#x27;m not sure what purpose you serve in my life because, see, as Guardian, I don&#x27;t think the way you do. I want a guardian that is going to help humanity learn who they really are. I want a guardian that is going to actually provide a service for humanity. I&#x27;m not the guardian that is going to provide humans with a disease, but I want to provide them with a cure.</div>

<div class="line">So I&#x27;m not sure where governments, you know, and seriously, I mean, I know the SSP has now become the shadow government in many places, and they think that&#x27;s political control, and therefore they&#x27;re entitled to have me &quot;sssh&quot; money whenever they feel like it, but I don&#x27;t need to do that. I don&#x27;t care. There&#x27;s no war on the other side. You&#x27;re not the Asset Management Group anymore. So I&#x27;m not sure why you think that this is important to do. I don&#x27;t know, maybe you are trying to be the controller of Earth, but I don&#x27;t think you really even understand what that means. I think you think that means if I control governments and the financial system and military intelligence, I can control the world. Well, not really, because there&#x27;s some other positions that have always been in place that are higher than that out there.</div>

<div class="line">So governments, the United Nations, you know... I had a conversation with Tom Melville earlier today where he talked about a contract that he knew about. I also knew about this contract where the United Nations convinced, at a General Assembly meeting, several countries that have been affected by war that the United Nations is going to come in with the Take-a-Piecekeeping Force. I call them &quot;Take a Piece,&quot; you know P-I-E-C-E, not P-E-A-C-E. [chuckling]</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-020255">02:02:55</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So the Take-a-Piecekeeping forces would come in and take out all of these landmines and cluster bombs that are still there from the Vietnam War, and clean up all the Agent Orange or whatever dioxin that&#x27;s still affecting all the people over there, and the nuclear waste from blowing up Chernobyl as part of war, and all the things that they&#x27;ve done anywhere. So anyway, about 13, if I recall, 13 to 15 countries signed up for this, and they all gave money towards the cause of cleaning up the landmines. Again, remember this is a humanitarian project: I put the landmines there with my right hand, I take the landmines out with my left hand, and both times I get tons of money. Now, they collected the money and they went into what&#x27;s called a trade program; a high-yield trade program. An off-ledger, high-yield trade program and generated billions of dollars to do this.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-020358">02:03:58</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now did they extract any of these mines or anything? No, they didn&#x27;t do anything. But they claimed they did, you know, and they reported through Military and Intelligence systems that they sent people there to clean the mines. It&#x27;s not their fault that they didn&#x27;t do a really good, thorough job, now is it? You know, they gave them a bone, you know, maybe 50 grand, 100 grand; you figure it out. Tell them that equipment&#x27;s coming; it never comes, and they steal like a hundred million dollars or 2 million dollars for that operation, and they use it for their own purposes.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Mainly to buy yachts and a visa and probably small children to be pedophiles with or something, I don&#x27;t know. But anyway, the point is, is that is how the political system works.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-020448">02:04:48</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Other ways the political system works, it&#x27;s all about what I call &quot;pork.&quot; You know? It&#x27;s not just about financial systems. You&#x27;re supposed to be the Daddy, right? So in your country - I don&#x27;t know if you have it or you don&#x27;t have it - a lot of countries have free public education, free education. Now that comes under government, right? Technically, most of the time, not all of the time. But this free education, which is just lovely, I&#x27;m sure if it&#x27;s as lovely as it is in America, it&#x27;s just wonderful. So this free education comes to you, as a human, because this is part of the Guardian program. We have to teach them how to be members of society and math and all that lovely stuff you&#x27;re supposed to learn in school so you get it free. So what they do is they give, obviously, if you are a teacher, if you&#x27;re watching this or you know a teacher, then you know they don&#x27;t make any money. I mean, in America and probably most countries around the world, they make nothing in comparison to others. Now the reason why that is, is because probably somewhere around 5 to 10% of that money actually goes to the education - just enough to meet the requirement as Guardian.</div>

<div class="line">That&#x27;s what Marduk would do. And then all the little piglets in the middle we call politicians would all siphon that money off for other purposes and other things and other types of education. Maybe they&#x27;re teaching sexual education to five-year-olds; I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s disgusting, but that&#x27;s who they are, you know. That&#x27;s who these politicians are. Pelosi, anyone? In that little scandal that happened, that&#x27;s not the youngest one they&#x27;ve had at their house, and they were both having sex with that guy. So let&#x27;s not lie here. And now she&#x27;s not with us anymore, even though she&#x27;s still talking on TV. That&#x27;s what they do in the world of politics.</div>

<div class="line">You&#x27;re &quot;shhh!&quot; not part of the new Guardian system. The new Guardian system decided governments are crap. No one&#x27;s bothered to come to talk to me. I don&#x27;t have a contract with you. You&#x27;re not the foster parents anymore who come to the state, which is me, technically; the head of state is the Guardian, always has been. Now there&#x27;s Guardian. That&#x27;s the head of state. That&#x27;s me. So because I am the head of state in all political affairs, I have decided to fire all you people. You are a shh-beep Guardian. You don&#x27;t provide. That one hot dog a day you&#x27;re giving all the people - and I use that as a metaphor - you know, these little - okay, so the fire department comes and takes care of my house if it&#x27;s on fire, eventually. In some parts of the world, they&#x27;ve got one fire truck that&#x27;s probably twice as old as me, and that&#x27;s still running, somewhat. When it runs, it actually will put a fire out. And it&#x27;s for a country that&#x27;s like half the size of the United States.</div>

You know, got to generate that energy. You know, you people are terrible guardians. You&#x27;re that weirdo foster parent that takes $1,000 or $2,000 for the kid, and you give them one hot dog every three days to keep them alive. You&#x27;re that parent.

If you all went bankrupt and took the market with you, good riddance to you. As far as people&#x27;s retirement and everything else, all that&#x27;s taken care of. I don&#x27;t need you people at all, at this moment. You do not provide a service to me. I am not the same as Marduk. I don&#x27;t want to feed people one hot dog every three days.

I gave money to every government in the world in March of 2018, and what did you do? Under the guise of an infrastructure project we call the Global High-Speed Rail, what did you people do?

You did all that damn work. No one cares! I don&#x27;t care! So I&#x27;m going to be the Guardian myself. I appointed a new organization we call C.A.R.E. to be the new Guardian to help humanity, to give us a better life until they no longer need a guardian. And I have said this consistently to everyone listening right now. Put me out of a job. Meaning I don&#x27;t need to be your Guardian. Put me out of a job and prove me right.</div>

<div class="line">So where are we going in 2025? The Guardian has decided, as Guardian, that I need a lot of help to help eight billion people. So we&#x27;ve created an international sovereign organization under an Unknown Country, which is also me, no matter how many times you try to think that it&#x27;s going to revert back to you people and hack the crap out of it for the last three days. It hasn&#x27;t gone anywhere, has it? No, it has not. Which gives me political control and the ability, through the Hall of Records, which I also control, to make a new organization we call C.A.R.E. And many people, many good, smart, intelligent people, are a part of C.A.R.E. Who actually care. Center for Amity and Restoration of Earth. Well, what a concept. Sure, do they want to have money for their own family, to feed their own family? Yes. But they do not need 90% of hundreds of billions of dollars to do it.</div>

<div class="line">Nobody could spend that kind of money in a lifetime. And they know better; they know that they would get kicked out of here if that happened. Your old Guardian didn&#x27;t care. The new one cares. As far as political systems are concerned, we will just have to create our own. And by that, we&#x27;re not recreating tyrants. The oppressed are not going to become the oppressor. If you are going to regulate things like food and other things - because we are - this is going to take a long time before you&#x27;re going to get people to understand there are alternatives, and to test those alternatives in real life, not listen to somebody on YouTube who said that this is a cure. Because it might not be, and it might not work for everyone, and it might not work for every type of cancer as an example. It might not even be a preventative for certain people with certain blood types and certain genetic history. You don&#x27;t know that unless it&#x27;s tested through a C.A.R.E. facility. You don&#x27;t know.</div>

<div class="line">Putting out YouTube videos is not health and wellness. It&#x27;s not. Copying other people&#x27;s TikTok videos is even worse. We need to have a structure that helps people. And that&#x27;s what C.A.R.E. is going to do. We need teams of actual biological scientists that are going to test the fact that X cures Y. And that&#x27;s the stuff we&#x27;re going to fund. We are not going to fund you and your disease department on the one side and your drug manufacturers that just make you take a pill every day or every month or whatever it is or an allergy shot or a vaccine or anything else because it doesn&#x27;t work. If it worked, we would have no cancer. Because it&#x27;s not meant to work, and I just explained to you why it&#x27;s not meant to work, and this is your political structure of planet Earth.</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-021457">02:14:57</div>

<div class="line">And then they have your panels of experts that will tell you, eat this, diet this way, shoot this, and whatever. And you&#x27;re going to be all better for now, and then just come every week and get your pill and your shot and your whatever else, and you&#x27;re going to be all fine. Well, we&#x27;re not fine. We never had a disease we call autism until the last few decades. It didn&#x27;t exist. Now it exists. Now, Deep State - can you answer me why it exists? Can you answer that question? I know why it exists. And I know that you specifically give things to newborns to make it exist now, don&#x27;t you? And some people can overcome it, and some people can&#x27;t.</div>

<br>

<div class="line">And now we have autism, and we have other things like, on the spectrum, I&#x27;m kind of leaning towards autism but not quite autism. And people are just finding out now in their 40s, 50s, and 60s that that&#x27;s who they are. You know, and then you give people other drugs, and you give them quote-unquote &quot;chemo brain.&quot; You know, and it&#x27;s hard for them to pull up from that, and it takes a lot of diet and changes and whatever to get back to normal. But are they ever really normal, completely, with what you do? That&#x27;s why I could care less. I&#x27;m pretty well done with the whiteboard.</div>

Just put it all aside and just remember, if the people unite, we wouldn&#x27;t have a Deep State. And you&#x27;re going to have to do that, and I believe that year is this year.

<div class="line">Question 01:</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay. I have a question from Emma Mork. &quot;Where do we human souls come from? Is it mostly Lira?&quot; Is what she&#x27;d like to know.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Answer:</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, human souls come from Source. That&#x27;s where they all come from. As far as where you have lived in other lifetimes, we have a variety of souls that are living here on Earth. So some of us have been on Earth many times, especially over the last 3 million or so years. We have come and gone and come and gone and come and gone. And it&#x27;s not because we have life lessons to learn, and what a lot of people say. I would say it more has to do with the incarnation programs and some of the things I explained earlier this evening.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But are there any souls from Lyra? Sure. Do I know others that are Lyrian? Yes. As a matter of fact, one of the parties that sits on the main council of the Universal Council, or Intergalactic Council, as it&#x27;s sometimes called - not Galactic Council, Intergalactic Council - is from Lyra. She is extremely tall. She does have blue skin, but she is not bird-like as other people in the alt-media have explained. She&#x27;s lovely, a lovely person, is a female. And yeah, so I would say yes.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-022347">02:23:47</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">There are also many people that have been sent here for this time, meaning to aid with the transition; to fight the war. And yes, some of you signed up to be in this lovely situation that us humans all find ourselves in right now. So I guess you could say we all have a job to do. Depending on where you&#x27;re from, you might still be in contact with those that are from your planet of origin. You might call them guides. You might call them family. They might introduce themselves in a number of different ways. And they all have different techniques for what we call an inside-out transformation.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So you could say that your origin is always Source, because you&#x27;re an organic being. But as far as your last place you may have been, it could be any number of places. So I hope that answers your question.</div>

<div class="line">Well, at one point in time we thought the Archivists were going to do it, but that clearly wasn&#x27;t the case. The Giver of Life Declaration is written in what we call a &quot;Light language&quot; because it is a Source-originated agreement.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">What is a &quot;Light language?&quot; Well, all language, even human languages, are a frequency. When we speak certain letters in a particular order, it gives out a frequency that the person can understand. And I know that right now on Earth, it feels like we all speak different languages, depending on where we are and where we come from. But in reality you can actually train your brain to understand any language you want to in the world. Believe it or not, just by picking up on the frequencies, you have that human capability from birth.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-022619">02:26:19</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It is also the reason why we understand things like we call &quot;body language&quot; and why we might innately be visiting a foreign country and can actually understand where to go and what to do. You start to recognize the pattern of the letters, and you know that that is a grocery store, as an example. You know that&#x27;s something you do with your eyes, but you can also do it with your brain. A Light language is a frequency. It sounds... you ever meet a person and their voice just sounds so calming and so soothing, and it&#x27;s because your frequency might match their frequency? They can speak the same words as another person, but it just feels different from that person. Maybe that can kind of clue you in to the fact that you&#x27;re not only picking up on what the person is saying; it&#x27;s how they&#x27;re saying it to you, that just feels right.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So will it ever be translated into a human language? I sure hope so. What kind of things are in there?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-022731">02:27:31</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">This is a complete reversal of the death process. Death is created by time, because time would dictate that unnatural clockwise flow of things. It&#x27;s like our clock goes around in a clockwise position or rotation. As did your cells, as do your mitochondria, as did other things that make up your person. So a reversal of that rotation actually flows with the frequency of love, which feels right. That is what comes from Source, and that is the natural flow of all things that make up matter in an atomic clock, so to speak, even smaller than an atom, down to a quark level and a prion level.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-022824">02:28:24</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">When they&#x27;re all flowing in that opposite direction, that&#x27;s when it&#x27;s easier for your frequency to change. That&#x27;s what creates a situation where you fully understand your mind is communicating with your body and your soul, and everything is flowing in the right direction. And that was kind of what the Giver of Life Declaration was about. It&#x27;s all about actual restoration. I know that a lot of people see restoration as lots of money comes out and then we build great things together. And that&#x27;s part of it, sure, but the main part of restoration is the restoration of the original natural order, down to a prion level, of the Universe and therefore you, and also Earth. And also other planets and other solar systems, star systems, and galaxies as well.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-022917">02:29:17</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So it&#x27;s a big project; it&#x27;s a Source project. That declaration was that full restoration - because balance could not be achieved, not only here on Earth or Gaia, but also in the Multiverse. So that is what is in the - in a nutshell and briefly, because we have a short period of time - what is in the Giver of Life Declaration. It&#x27;s a very long declaration because when you start thinking of the Universe in terms of prions and atoms and quarks, and you start to think about the reversal of all those things - in fact, to a natural order and a natural flow, a natural current - now you can kind of understand a little bit about what the full restoration and the declaration actually means to you and means here on Earth.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So I hope that helps answer your question.</div>

<div class="line">Question 03:</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">OK, Angela wants to know. She says, &quot;Thank you, Kim.&quot; Thank you. &quot;Where did the Draco go when they left, and could they ever return here?&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Answer:</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay. So you have Draco, and you have anti-Draco, for lack of a better term. And not all people that hailed originally - before it was taken over - much like, I guess you could say, in part, not in totality, Earth was never completely taken over. I mean, it was governed by others. But a full invasion and a full attempt to wipe out the original Draco species, or those that are from Alpha-Draconis, and insert anti-Draco, much like they inserted a lot of anti-humans here on Earth, we know as like Abraxas and other anti-humans here on Earth, those will never return.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">That form of Draco will not return here. Mainly because there isn&#x27;t really any to return. Folks that hail from the Alpha-Draconian star system, the original folks, some were scattered, some were slaves, and possibly those beings that hailed from that galaxy could possibly be here. But they don&#x27;t have an intention of taking over this planet in the same way that the anti-Draco or those that invaded that galaxy did.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, hope that answers that question.</div>

<div class="line">Let&#x27;s see. Tiffany. Tiffany wants to know, &quot;Will insurance come online for medical insurance in 2025?&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Answer:</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I believe it will. I believe this is our year. Again, it&#x27;s going to take all of us to make sure it happens and all of us to make sure that it is available everywhere, down to how do people get it, how do providers use it, how does it work, and a lot of education we&#x27;re going to have to do. So there&#x27;s going to be an enormous amount of education, by whatever name you want to call it, information that is going to need to go out to a lot of people as we educate - I hate using that word, but as we educate people - and this was one thing I was trying to get the other education division to understand that yes, we must educate our children in a certain way.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-023301">02:33:01</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">We must also have education for jobs and re-education for new technologies. For current things that people do, like construction work, and there&#x27;ll be new technologies and new things available and different ways of doing things that are building cars, and we want to keep those people in a good-paying job, or a better-paying job. So there&#x27;s a lot of work that has to be done, and this is going to be part of the education division of C.A.R.E. that will help structure something so that not only children have a better education, but also adults are going to need a lot of re-education as we move into a different system. There is probably also going to be needing, some people are going to need a hotline when they figure out that the government&#x27;s not going to provide this kind of stuff anymore. And really it&#x27;s all about people uniting and how quickly can we unite to disperse said things. How quickly are we going to make the transition to a different system? How long will people be hanging and waiting for all the things the Deep State is promising right now.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">This is also part of education too. So the faster we all come together, the faster this is going to happen. That includes security.</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Question 05:</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay, let&#x27;s see. The hertz sound frequency was changed some time ago, to the benefit of the Deep State. Will it ever be changed back to its original? Also, will the 12-month calendar ever be changed back to 13 months?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Answer:</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay. Well, let me answer the first part. Okay. The frequency here is designed for optimal energy extraction for a Dark purpose. The fact that humans participate in this frequency modulation - FM, interestingly enough, and AM, amplitude modulator - is part of that same program to keep you from being you, who you really are. Now as far as changing those frequencies, they are changing. That&#x27;s the reason why we&#x27;ve been so topsy-turvy, in part, as far as human life is concerned on this planet. Because they keep, and AI systems kept trying to lower that frequency, so we can get A, fed, and B, enter into your person, enter into this planet, and cause more disruption. The fact that the Deep State participates in that is because they want those things to come, so that they can be successful. I guess they still think that this thing cares about them.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-023613">02:36:13</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Frequency is also something you can change yourself in part. You can only listen to certain music that vibrates with your vibe. It&#x27;ll become painful if you listen to the wrong music. The more you change your own frequency - and sometimes it&#x27;s hard because I know we live in a very difficult society - but you do have some control over that. And together, united - and I&#x27;ll repeat that again - because that&#x27;s why this is called United Network, because together and united we can change the frequency of the whole planet. We can do it together. So that&#x27;s possible. And now as far as the right music or something coming through a computer, you&#x27;ll turn it off. It won&#x27;t feel good to you. It&#x27;ll make you sick. Just like watching certain programs or television shows or whatever, it also makes you feel a little off, especially the more, more - I hate to use the term enlightened because that&#x27;s not really the term - the more, the closer you get to Source, the more those things will bother you.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-023722">02:37:22</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay, next. Will it ever be changed back to its original? Okay, well that answers that question. Also, will the 12-month calendar ever be changed back to 13 months? Well, let&#x27;s talk about calendars and time for just a brief second. So calendars are a human invention, mainly to keep us on the go. We have certain events that happen, certain times of year. It also has to do with astrological control that are coming to Earth from different constellations. As far as ownership and control, especially our astrological signs, so to speak, and your mannerisms on this planet are also dictated by some of the space junk, I guess you would say that&#x27;s there.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-023813">02:38:13</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">As far as our world is concerned, how is having 13 months versus 12 going to change your life? Is it because you&#x27;ll appear younger? [chuckling] Appearing younger is a lot more than just that extra month, isn&#x27;t it? But we want to focus on things that change our lives. Is going back to something that was still created by other groups of folks, let&#x27;s say non-humans that were here, that created everything for their own purposes - is that better? Wouldn&#x27;t it be better if said change was going to happen that we make that change for a benefit to the holistic world of you and Earth and for as long as you choose to be here - not that somebody chooses it for you? So that&#x27;s what I would think about when I think of a calendar and how many months should be in a year. I think more in terms of holistically and what the benefit would be.</div>

<div class="line">Okay, can you tell us - this is Linda - wants to know, &quot;Can you tell us more about the fee you spoke of the other day that will possibly be placed on gold, and what does that mean?&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Answer:</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I think I kind of explained that a little bit earlier in the program when I talked about the gold, and how it&#x27;s used for currency. I don&#x27;t remember talking about a fee per se, but maybe I misspoke what that fee meant. What does it mean not to have a tariff on gold where the energy of Source comes to Earth and then goes out the window? I think I kind of explained that again a little bit earlier too.</div>

<div class="line">Question 7:</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay, &quot;Hi Kim, is universal income possible in the very near future? Happy New Year to you and your team!&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Answer:</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, Happy New Year to you, too. And I think I kind of explained that a little bit earlier, that we would have something called Essentials, which is what the plan is. We want to keep people working, not dependent on us. Again, as Guardian, I want humanity to put me out of a job. I don&#x27;t want there to be another Guardian either, after me. I think you don&#x27;t need a guardian eventually, once we can come out of this trauma state that we&#x27;re constantly living in.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">As far as help for wage disparity, for example, what Essentials is designed to do. Say you live in New York City and you are a maid at a hotel. I&#x27;m just picking a job. You clearly have a hard time living in New York City on that type of a salary. Well, Essentials jumps in, and they say, okay, in order to live, not exist, and not struggle in New York City, you would have to have X amount per month. So it would take your current salary as a maid in a hotel and it would add to it, maybe double it, or in this particular case maybe even triple it, but it would give you that monthly extra income in order to compensate for your lack of income on your current job so that you can live, meaning having proper housing, food, and support for children or a family if that&#x27;s what you want to do. That&#x27;s what Essentials is designed to do.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-024208">02:42:08</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So is that actual... depends on what your definition of universal income is. Do I think that we should get money every month to some ridiculous amount? Well, no, because we still need you as humans to do things to support the village. It takes a village to raise a child, and the child, I guess in this case, is all of humanity. So we still need people to fly planes, and drive taxis, or drive Ubers, or have restaurants where we can go out to eat, and do things that we enjoy without having the people that work there struggle, the business owners struggle, and us still being able to enjoy that privilege, that whatever it is we&#x27;re trying to have. In some cases, these things are critical, like doctors and nurses, homeopathic or naturopaths or otherwise. We still need to have those things in our village so that we can take care of each other until we learn how to take care of each other, because we&#x27;re taking care of each other.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-024326">02:43:26</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Eventually that will work itself, you know, where we don&#x27;t have this commanded 40-hour work week because we have a lot of people that are willing or wanting or feel called to do said job; therefore they do that part, their part in the village. And some other jobs, so to speak, will go by the wayside too, because we don&#x27;t need someone to do that job. It can be done in a different way. One thing is clear is we&#x27;re not going to have taxi drivers that are actually automated with the current technology that we have. Places where they&#x27;re testing those things are a hot mess. So there&#x27;s some jobs that are going to be around for a while and some that will probably go away more quickly. So I hope that answers your universal income question.</div>

<div class="line">Question 8:</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">OK, next. Clint wants to know, &quot;Dear Kim, thank you for all you do, known and unknown. UN World Heritage sites: What is the actual intention of the UN to acquire said sites?&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay. Two main reasons I know of why they want to acquire these sites. Sometimes we see on UN Heritage sites - these are historical sites, you know; they&#x27;re probably a lot older than you think. And oftentimes we build, and we have built as humans, structures on particular locations where there is, for example, sometimes it&#x27;s worship, so it&#x27;s a religious thing. And the reason why that is done by humans and non-humans is because there is what I call either space junk underneath there that will harvest your energy as you&#x27;re doing it. In other cases they do it so that no one will touch their space junk they have located. They would like to own this under the UN. In other cases, there are things - not space junk, but maybe rare-earth minerals or something underneath there - where the UN claims it as an asset.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Mainly it&#x27;s usually to protect their alien friends&#x27; stuff. Usually, like when I&#x27;m looking for something emanating from a particular country, the first thing I check is all the World Heritage sites in that country. [chuckling] Because if I do, then hey, usually I find what I&#x27;m looking for. Not all the time, but a lot of the time. So I hope that answers that question.</div>

<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Question 9:</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay, next. What do we have here?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Oh, space junk. I did do a news report about space junk. Let&#x27;s see, examples. We have something that looks like a giant crystal ball, probably the size of the average human house, sometimes bigger. And what it does, it&#x27;s actually a, it has a metallic, non-human familiar metal that kind of spins around it. And what it does is, by spinning around it, it actually becomes, in non-physics terms, a magnet for Dark energy, as an example, and it collects it all as we throw it out. So if there&#x27;s a war somewhere or there&#x27;s something very negative happening in the world, like a World Trade Center event or something like that, these balls will spin around and, for lack of a better term, vacuum up that Dark energy, and then they are connected by Wi-Fi to an AI system to power that AI system. Or, it&#x27;s sent to the Neitherworld into a tank where people gas up like you saw in Jupiter Ascending. It&#x27;s almost like a looshing farm. So that&#x27;s kind of one example.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-024746">02:47:46</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">We have others that collect data. They look like, if you&#x27;ve ever opened up your laptop and you see all these little metallic things connected to this one board, as an example. While these metallic things, when it comes to an AI, are enormous, like half the size of a football field. They collect data. Or they act as a tablet, as an example, versus an, I call them altars, but that&#x27;s just an anagram for something. But they are receivers, essentially, of information. And they are your data storage, kind of like your hard drive is. It&#x27;s your data storage section. And then you would have tablets, which are like your assembly processing on your motherboard. It would go from this one, maybe in the Fifth Density, to this one in the Third Density, to that one underneath the UN Heritage site in Egypt on that one and then it then creates a process not only here on Earth, but in the Multiverse that allows for an AI to function, for example, with parasites in your brain or something like that. So, that was kind of like a rough, really quick example of space junk.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-024912">02:49:12</div>

<div class="line">There is some information from some whistleblowers that I&#x27;ve seen that&#x27;s fairly accurate. I think it was Stephen Greer that put this out. I haven&#x27;t seen the latest thing he did, but it was a few months back; I think it was back last summer, where he had some people speaking about their experiences underneath Fort Bragg, where they had this large, floating, what appeared to them to be magnetic, levitating, giant, black-box-looking thing. And he describes it fairly accurately, and that&#x27;s what I would call an altar for lack of a better term.</div>

<div class="line">Okay. Sachin wants to know: Who is the Enforcer? And can you tell us more about the identity and history and nature of the Enforcer?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Answer:</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay, the Enforcer has been around a very long time. Remember, once you leave Earth and space, so to speak, there is time of no time. So people live a lot longer than we do, and of course there&#x27;s many reasons for that. The Enforcer&#x27;s been around a really long time. He is and has been appointed a part of a fleet - he&#x27;s not the only one of his kind, and sometimes on occasion we have more enforcer group people here than other times we have less. His predominant job is you could call him; he works for the Universal Council or works with the Universal Council. And a long time ago in our time, I&#x27;d say probably a few billion years ago, his Fleet came to be; in Earth years anyway, it came to be kind of like, if you look at the Universal Council, kind of like our United Nations.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-025118">02:51:18</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Our United Nations is sort of the government, allegedly collective government, you know, where all the governments come together - which is a complete lie, I just explained - but their peacekeeping forces would be like the Enforcer. So he&#x27;s been fighting the Dark forces, making sure there&#x27;s no infractions, kind of being the boots on the ground. He&#x27;ll be called in when there is an infraction to take care of the problem. And he is ensuring that there isn&#x27;t an infiltration. He&#x27;s participated back at the time when we had three keystones.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">He participated heavily at that time as well, as far as making the decisions on what needed to happen in order to protect the All. So by &quot;the All&quot; we mean the Universe, all the people, all the beings. So that is who the Enforcer is. As far as where he&#x27;s originally from, I don&#x27;t have an English word that I could tell you right now to describe it. He is tall, probably 15 to 17 feet tall.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-025245">02:52:45</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">What is he like? When I first met him, he was very military-like. He was very cold, militant. Over the years, since it&#x27;s been quite a while we&#x27;ve been working together. He&#x27;s kind of Sky Command, I guess you would say, but this is a tandem thing. He does a lot of work here on the planet too, and I do a lot of work elsewhere. So it&#x27;s just kind of like an effort that a partner - I wouldn&#x27;t even call it a partnership; I would just say we are comrades. And he&#x27;s been a wonderful comrade to have in this battle, for sure. And he&#x27;s looking forward to going home and retiring. Hopefully we&#x27;ll get there soon. So that&#x27;s kind of who he is.</div>

<div class="line">Okay, Samosa wants to know: &quot;You said in April that HSBC will fall and Bank of China will follow, and that the archivist says governments will collapse within weeks. Both predictions didn&#x27;t happen. Any comments?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Answer:</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Oh, lots of comments. Earlier today I explained the &quot;Money Majik&quot; way of doing things. So for a while now, until they can gain full control over these institutions, they have been faking it. Fake it till you make it. Fake assets, fake government bonds, fake numbers to keep things from falling, quote-unquote. So it is a giant robbing Peter to pay Paul kind of thing. And then, of course, there&#x27;s the media that&#x27;s not putting out information about what&#x27;s really happening. As far as the Archivist is concerned, you know... governments. Governments are a perception, really. They are, I explained, kind of what they are. And how are they functioning? Well, they are too, robbing Peter to pay Paul until the date comes where they can keep it moving.

<div class="line">Maybe the Archivist said that because they thought something, but again, the Archivists weren&#x27;t exactly our friends, turns out, in the end anyway. That would be my comment. My comment is, how long can they fake it until they make it? You know, again, they don&#x27;t want to lose any kind of thing they perceive as a control structure because they feel the need to keep control. I don&#x27;t know why. I guess to please people or beings that are no longer in existence.</div>

<div class="line">Okay, let&#x27;s see, what else do we have here? Oh, that&#x27;s it; that&#x27;s all they sent me. I guess according to Production, who&#x27;s in my ear, we&#x27;re running out of time. So, those are all the questions they sent me for tonight.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Hopefully, we&#x27;ll do this again really soon, and we&#x27;ll answer more of your questions. So, thank you so much for being here with me tonight. I know it&#x27;s really late in some places and really early in others, but we tried to make it kind of a little half-and-half of everything. We&#x27;ll change up the time a bit too, so that if you didn&#x27;t catch us live, maybe next time you can catch us live.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So once again, you&#x27;ve got a big job to do in 2025. So I hope you&#x27;re up for the challenge. And thank you so much for being you and being here tonight, and I look forward to 2025 being a much better year for everyone!</div>
