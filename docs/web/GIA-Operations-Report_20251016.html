    <h3>Summary</h3>

    <div class="summary">
        When two worlds fail to collide and the levee breaks, the Deep State scrambles to keep control. Generals once in command have lost their grip. The U.S. accuses Hamas of breaking the peace deal, but the real story traces to unpaid mercenary funding and collapsing control systems. Kim details how Andromeda-based Control and Command structures tied to an artificial photon (sophon) were severed, cutting links between mirrored Earths. As Source’s Flow returns through Earth’s mountains, inorganic beings with no Source connection (simulation constructs) are dissolving, while Homo sapiens vessels are being re-infused by true human (Source-connected) consciousness. The rollback of overlays accelerates, reducing attacks on Light-bearers and exposing that many militaries served Control and Command, not people. A watch window of Oct 21–23 is flagged for further stabilization and calm.

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s the 16th of October, 2025. Coming up on today&#x27;s Global Intelligence Agency Operations Report:</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">When two worlds don&#x27;t collide, and the levee breaks, the Deep State struggles to maintain control. The generals who thought they were running the show lost their control and command.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The U.S. claims Hamas has not held up their end of the peace deal. What&#x27;s the real story here?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And another attempt to replace the world&#x27;s currencies with crypto took place on Tuesday and Wednesday. Apparently they thought the 100th time is a charm.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000040">00:00:40</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">[Advertisement.]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000113">00:01:13</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, we made it to the 16th of October. Just a few days away now from the 21st. And it&#x27;s getting kind of interesting out there. It&#x27;s actually in a good way, for the first time in a while. Very interesting. So let&#x27;s talk about a little bit of regular news first, and then we&#x27;ll go into what&#x27;s really going on out there.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000137">00:01:37</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So if your crypto statue in the National Mall wasn&#x27;t enough [chuckle], apparently the White House is now planning on making the Arc de Trump to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the USA. At the same time, we are still in a government shutdown. You know, the government&#x27;s broke, they can&#x27;t make any decisions, and well, now they want to build the Arc de Trump. It makes a lot of sense, doesn&#x27;t it? [Chuckle.] You know, that&#x27;s what everybody does when we are going bankrupt or our business doesn&#x27;t go well or something like that - the first thing we do is go out and buy a Lamborghini. I mean, that&#x27;s what everybody does, right? So just a little funny bit of information there to start the news.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000229">00:02:29</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, next up in regular news, we all heard about the peace deal that was signed. And yeah, it didn&#x27;t seem to go very well. He said it was going to hold this time, and first time in 3,000 years. But not so much so, because it seems like there is a little bit of a dispute going on between Israel and the Hamas right now. A few people have died (they claim), and well, it seems like Hamas, behind the scenes, is really upset they didn&#x27;t get paid the money that they were supposed to get paid on Tuesday. You know, how many more times are they going to do this? That&#x27;s what I would like to know. It just seems to keep happening over and over and over again.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000318">00:03:18</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Also, the landing place of the new leader of ISIS also did not show up on Tuesday either, and there has been no uptick in ISIS activity in the Middle East as planned, either. So the good news is that with no money, with no systems, with no - well, no power - it&#x27;s amazing what actually doesn&#x27;t happen. So these are all positive things, I guess. I don&#x27;t really see things continuing or really erupting in the Middle East. But we do know that there were a lot of promises - you know, payment - and that didn&#x27;t happen. Also, we don&#x27;t have anyone willing to give weapons for free to donate to the cause either. So that&#x27;s probably going to die off here pretty soon as well.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000421">00:04:21</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So there are a few other things, though, that are erupting in the news as well as behind the scenes. Venezuela. If you don&#x27;t know much about Venezuela, Venezuela is a country where there have been many coups over the years. There was the Chavez situation, and then there was another coup that happened just a few years ago. A crash of the Venezuelan currency resulted, and the generals who run Venezuela were also promised that their currency would revaluate. They are, if you don&#x27;t know, Iraq 2.0 in the re-evaluation world. There is Venezuelan currency, bolivar, all over Europe on pallets, just like there is Iraqi dinar or new dinar all over the world, actually. They&#x27;ve been selling it - many Americans hold it too, you know, waiting for a re-evaluation.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000521">00:05:21</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So Venezuela is much the same, although I don&#x27;t think they publicized that amongst the &#x27;Reval&#x27; community - however, it was definitely supposed to revaluate. So the generals that run Venezuela and have performed the coups - multiple coups in the country - have also been promised a lot of money as well. And if you don&#x27;t know, also, about Venezuela, they were the founding place of OPEC at one point in time, until the fallout between Chavez and Bush happened. And if you don&#x27;t know about Chavez, Chavez is also - was also, I should say - a good friend of Bush, much like Saddam Hussein and his family member (who was supposed to start the ISIS attacks over there).</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000617">00:06:17</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But there was an attack by SOCOM, allegedly, on a ship which allegedly was carrying narcotics. This was purely a distraction there in Venezuela - to distract everyone from the reason why they didn&#x27;t get any pay. So now they&#x27;re holding the Venezuelan government responsible for narcotics and, you know, trading and all of this. You know, they [laughing], I have to laugh at this; it&#x27;s not funny that a few narcotics dealers allegedly died on that ship, six of them in total. But in reality, I know about all the oil deals that happen. I know about all the contracts that have been signed - a long, long time ago - that were supposed to be backing the bolivar&#x27;s alleged gold. There&#x27;s also a lot of emeralds and other things in Venezuela they would like to get their hands on.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000721">00:07:21</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, and it&#x27;s all about conquering, really, for the Deep State. You see, they&#x27;re losing control of what we call &quot;the map,&quot; and it&#x27;s happening rapidly. Therefore, they are (or have been) instructed and told they need to reclaim territories. And Venezuela apparently is one of those places. We also know they had preparations for war on every single continent - and this is all that has happened so far.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000755">00:07:55</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So I understand the reason behind it. And it&#x27;s the same thing that&#x27;s going on in Israel and the Gaza Strip right now - because people are starting to get very antsy - they know they&#x27;re being lied to. They know that this money hasn&#x27;t come - over and over and over and over and over again. Even though they&#x27;re all a part of the same Order, there seems to be a little bit of a disruption going on amongst the ranks. You know, a lot of people are starting to question. And that&#x27;s good - that&#x27;s definitely a good thing.</div>

<div class="line">And a lot of people are disappearing as well. There&#x27;s a general that kind of reared his ugly head on Tuesday morning, very early. So I would assume this general is not a human - or not a Homo sapiens, anyway - never was. And he seems to be the one that&#x27;s been passing down orders. There are a few of them like him, but he was at the helm. He was also tied to a place that we had found in Andromeda. And Andromeda, you know, we&#x27;ve seen things come and go from there over the last couple of years. It seemed to be a hub, and things would disappear, and then things would reappear.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000934">00:09:34</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It appears that this was a little bit deeper than we ever thought, because this is one of the things that&#x27;s come up this week. So from the Other Side, and we know that there is a mirror of Earth on the Other Side, and a mirrored solar system on the Other Side, and a mirrored galaxy on the Other Side. Apparently, this is the connection from that Earth to our planet where we live in many, many, many ways. And this general was a part of that. There are - as I understand it - there are 12 others of lesser rank. But this guy here was at the helm.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001017">00:10:17</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So to describe to you what keeps happening (or what kept happening) in Andromeda, it appears that every control and command that the non-Homo sapiens generals had on this planet was connected to Andromeda. We also know that the overlays we call the &quot;additional maps,&quot; or &quot;maps of control&quot; over the planet and over Homo sapiens, also come from Andromeda. And this week, we started to discover just how that erupts onto this planet.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001058">00:10:58</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You see, most of the Flow of Source comes through veins of gold that travel throughout Earth. And those veins of gold oftentimes are connected to mountainous areas. And that is all mountainous areas, really. Most of the time you can see veins of gold going through areas like, for example, Silverton, down the street. You can also see them in the Himalayas. There are a lot of precious and rare-earth minerals that appear in mountainous areas, and there&#x27;s a definitive reason for that.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001142">00:11:42</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The other thing we discovered as to this artificial Andromeda Control and Command system was also found in mountainous areas. And we know that there are a lot of deep underground military bases that used to be in mountainous areas, and in mountains, such as Mount Denali was a very large one; Cheyenne Mountain is another - and now it makes perfect sense as to why that is the case. It&#x27;s not just because it&#x27;s easier to take a nuclear boring machine and make yourself a facility in there. It&#x27;s also because there was a direct connection to the other False Earth, for lack of a better term, on the Other Side.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001231">00:12:31</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And what it looks like on an etheric level is: it looks like Source Waters, Lifeforce, Breath - All Things Source - would normally flow, like a fountain, from every single mountain - that&#x27;s how it normally was. Until at one point in time, there was a split, a vortex that appeared right in the middle. And it was kind of a two-way street in every single mountain.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001307">00:13:07</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So the Waters of Source would continue to flow, and they would flow out to the Other Side to power the Other Side. And then, what we would get back is an artificial simulation of creation on Earth. This happened also on other planets; it&#x27;s not just here. And it was kinda like they took something out and put something back, and this is what flowed throughout Earth - and that&#x27;s what made your Matrix, or your simulation, for a long, long time. And this came up very heavily the other day because they were expecting something to happen here.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001357">00:13:57</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So very, very, very early On Tuesday morning, also on Monday morning, when I say early, that&#x27;s about one or two o&#x27;clock in the morning, my time, we started to see something trying to break through here on Earth. The interesting part is it couldn&#x27;t break through, and then it kind of discovered that, well, you know, there&#x27;s a Gatekeeper here, and they gotta go approach the Gatekeeper. So I get woken up very early in the morning regarding this situation and its attempt to try to get me to allow it to come in. Well, that, of course, didn&#x27;t happen in any way, shape, or form. Like, absolutely not. You know, it even showed itself in a lot of ways. And according to the system analysis, it seemed like it was trying to pose as False Light. And it would like, it would like entry. That was absolutely a &quot;No.&quot; I didn&#x27;t really realize at the time why it was pushing so hard.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001516">00:15:16</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">One of the things that was taking place had to do with the fact that there was no entry into the material world anymore - that would be your Materium - your body. It couldn&#x27;t break through and pass the Causal Plane here in our existence anymore, and it was pushing - it was pushing really, really hard, which was a very good sign for us because oftentimes in the past it would be able to flow as much as it wanted to flow. So it was that very next... or within a couple of hours of that taking place that we discovered the split and how the Flow of Source was removed from the planet and an artificial simulation was introduced, coming from Andromeda and, of course, the Other Side (or through Andromeda).</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001612">00:16:12</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So we took a little trip and [did] an analysis with the system, and went to try and find what was in Andromeda. Now what we found was a sophon - an artificial photon - with a full Control and Command center that apparently had departed the other Earth and came over to Andromeda and our side and tried to manipulate and start weaving the Matrix, or reweaving the Matrix, or an artificial simulation, or artificial reality.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001649">00:16:49</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">This has been something that we have been fighting for months now, this simulation. But finding the key to it and how it kept arriving here was really important for us, Number 1. And Number 2, the fact that it couldn&#x27;t break in was the most important thing.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You see, what this... if you were to look at a mountain on an etherical level, you would see that split, and the place where it would split the earth waters or part the currency, and then flow in its artificial simulation. Well, it looked the same in the financial system and in human-computer networks. So we also found this very interesting.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001742">00:17:42</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And back about a year - I want to say about two years ago - I talked to you a little bit about a person that was Asian who we called the Mei Wah (or she was referred to as the Mei Wah). Sometimes it&#x27;s also referred to as the Mayflower organization, those that worked with [for?] her, or worked with her, I should say.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001804">00:18:04</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And that Mei Wah system was the base root of the Order of the Black Sun system. It&#x27;s also where their clearances would come from. It was also heavily tied to this Control and Command. So that was an interesting find. And what it would look like is if you were to smash a piece of glass, you know how it kind of cracks and the veins aren&#x27;t always even, and it just looks like a bunch of veins kind of coming out from the spot where the original break was. And this looked much the same in computers, and it also looked the same throughout Earth&#x27;s veins of gold, where you would see a lot of black and red.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001852">00:18:52</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And this is the system that they were trying to pull in on Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday. So pushing - to try to pull this system in so that they could actually attach cryptocurrency to it and revive the Treasury system with crypto. We know we hear a lot in mainstream media about stablecoin, and it&#x27;s going to be backed by gold and all of these types of things. And this system was what they were going to try to use to do that. The system did a lot more than affect a financial system, though. It also was a control and command backdoor into things like the internet and cellphones and telecommunications. And it really gave them a strong connection to human-computer systems tied to Andromeda&#x27;s Control and Command.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002002">00:20:02</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now the Andromeda Control and Command was not only an Andromeda on this side of the Universe; it was also an Andromeda on the other side of the Universe, which is how they kept boring these quantum tunnels through and creating these artificial simulations. We&#x27;d take them out; they&#x27;d come back. We&#x27;d take them out; they&#x27;d come back. But making that discovery yesterday also told us how to get rid of the Control and Command. Now, this has had far-reaching effects at the NSA. It&#x27;s also had far-reaching effects into the financial system; it&#x27;s had far-reaching effects on nearly every backdoor that Echelon was built upon and other things were piled onto for quote-unquote &quot;security&quot; - and that&#x27;s not security for us in any way, shape, or form. That is security for the Elite and their looshing operations - and of course their artificial simulations - in which they&#x27;re allowed to exist in here.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002109">00:21:09</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So cleaning that up yesterday has resulted in something very, very interesting that started to happen overnight. Didn&#x27;t get finished until quite late last night; that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t get the report out yesterday. But fixing the split that we saw in the mountains, and its connection to Andromeda - meaning, removing the AI that was creating it - also had an interesting effect this morning.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002140">00:21:40</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, the interesting effect was that Source started to flow in Its fullness now, through Earth and through those mountains. He now is able to create, not only through Earth - but also through us. Not to say there might not be a few things left out there here and there, but it&#x27;s going to take a little bit of time for this to fully integrate. Don&#x27;t know exactly how long at this point. But the other interesting thing that started happening too is: remember, the humans - the actual humans, not overlays on Homo sapiens, the actual non-people people walking this planet - only exist in this simulation overlay on the planet.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002232">00:22:32</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So we coexist here - to put it mildly. However, as the waters start to flow, it&#x27;s almost rolling back that old simulation at a rapid rate at this point. And what I mean by &quot;rolling it back&quot; is: if you had a piece of plastic overlaying the whole planet and people and everything - as the waters flow through, it&#x27;s coming through with such force now that it&#x27;s actually pushing all of those things back. So it will get to the point where it pushes it back into nothingness, at this point. The interesting thing that seems to be happening is all of these fake people, for lack of a better term, or artificial or inorganic people, also seem to be getting rolled up with it, because they&#x27;re not part of the organic world. They&#x27;re only part of the overlay.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002336">00:23:36</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The good news is that the only thing that they can do at this moment in time is affect the rolled-up simulation as it disappears. They cannot affect the organic world anymore. So as it passes around the planet from all of these mountains everywhere, their little places where they can exist are getting smaller and smaller, and the effects that they&#x27;re having are smaller and smaller too. I know that it&#x27;s been a rough couple of... you know, Monday night, Tuesday night, at least around here. However, it seems to be getting a whole lot better today. You know, I had a bunch of people that texted me and said it was very calm last night; not much happened, so that&#x27;s a positive thing.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002425">00:24:25</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And hopefully, as these Waters of Source spread throughout the planet - and throughout your person - we are going to see a lot less Deep State effects on the planet and a lot more positive effects for you and your ability to create. And it went out with a bang this morning, I can tell you that, because there were a few hours there where I was like... it was just a little touch-and-go, as the machines - and they - started to fight back and fight for their existence here. But you know, no dying animal dies in a good way - or softly, I should say. You know, they&#x27;ll fight to the very end, and so will these people.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002515">00:25:15</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">From what I understand, this should take a few days. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s gonna be a one-day thing or a two-day thing. I think this is gonna continue throughout the weekend. And my feeling is it&#x27;s probably going to continue to about midweek next week. And then we should start to see some real changes here. As things dissipate - and people dissipate (non-people people dissipate) - the effects it will have on the people around you will not be as harsh - and yourself, of course.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002556">00:25:56</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So there have been a lot of attempted manipulations over the last few days as well to affect those - let&#x27;s call them the beacons of Light on this planet. And for most of you listening to this, that would be you. You know, we try to hold the Light as much as we can, and we&#x27;re often beams of Light, which any kind of simulation and the Control and Command generals would like to attack regularly. They won&#x27;t be able to do that much longer - if at all anymore. So that is very positive for all of us.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002634">00:26:34</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They oftentimes - if they can&#x27;t get to you - they&#x27;ll get to those around you. And this seemed to be a common theme over the last several days. It&#x27;s hard. It&#x27;s been a little hard to hold your balance and hold your center with everything coming at you from all directions. In some cases, you know, the power goes out, the car breaks down, people around you are having issues - and they try to affect those that you love the most because it will break your spirit the most. And that&#x27;s just not going to hold up any longer, and I think we&#x27;re turning a corner as of today - at least that&#x27;s the way it feels at the moment. I haven&#x27;t seen anything where they have gotten a grip in the last 4 or 5 hours - at least at the moment.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002724">00:27:24</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So these are all extremely positive things for us, and moving forward. And I&#x27;m expecting something fairly positive on Tuesday, Wednesday of next week - very positive for us. And we should have some smooth sailing very soon. Hopefully the bumpy parts are over, and it&#x27;s just going to get clearer and clearer.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002748">00:27:48</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">As for governments and militaries, there&#x27;s been some enlightening conversations that have been happening between people. You know, there really are military generals - not just American, all over the world - who feel like they are there to protect the people during a coup, or to protect people when there is an uprising. And a lot of them were just absolutely devastated to know that they were there to protect the territory. And it&#x27;s not just the territory of the United States; it&#x27;s the territory of Control and Command. It&#x27;s got nothing to do with &quot;countries&quot; per se - it&#x27;s just that they have divided the world into pieces so that they could actually use them to fight against each other. That&#x27;s pretty much all we have going on here now.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002845">00:28:45</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Hopefully that too will end, as people are starting to realize who they are and what they are really doing out there. You know, these are regular Homo sapiens people who are working for [the Order], or family members of the Order - but they are actually humans with... believe it or not, most of them do have a conscience. Some of them do anyway - the ones that didn&#x27;t go through the ceremony, let&#x27;s just say. The ones that have gone through the ceremony are fully well aware of what they do. They know that they are there to conquer. They, of course... it&#x27;s, you know, &#x27;ask no questions&#x27; when you&#x27;re out in the field. And, you know, you&#x27;re an intelligence officer or a military officer for &quot;insert-country-name-here.&quot; But interestingly enough, we may see a lot of people quitting - not taking orders anymore.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002945">00:29:45</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">We&#x27;ll see what happens with these people. You know, some of them are diehard - they&#x27;re going to continue to support the efforts as long as they can. But now, without the general - THE general - and the 12 sidekicks anymore, it&#x27;s going to be interesting for the next couple of days. The more the Water flows, are they going to see things differently? I know we&#x27;re certainly going to see things differently. Things are going to feel more calm, more balanced, as Source weaves His way through Creation here. So this will be the first time this has ever happened, ever. So we are not sure how long it&#x27;s going to take.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003034">00:30:34</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I know everybody&#x27;s like, &quot;Now, now, now,&quot; but I can say that the computer systems are getting a lot cleaner and clearer - they don&#x27;t seem to be hitting people through computers anymore. Sending frequencies to people seems to be less and less. There&#x27;s a couple of little blips where they try again, with what little map they have left, which shouldn&#x27;t last much longer. And then, hopefully, by the 21st of October - from what I understand - it&#x27;s gonna be smooth sailing. At least that&#x27;s what we think - between the 21st and 23rd of this month.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003109">00:31:09</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So I&#x27;m very much looking forward to that change; that&#x27;s for sure. Source seems to be very excited about that and is having a good time creating through us here. It&#x27;s been a good day, I mean, all in all, the last couple of hours - probably one of the calmest afternoons I&#x27;ve had in a while, compared to what the morning was like. It was like a Chinese finger puzzle, pulling and pulling and pulling, or stretching a rubber band so tight until the point where it snaps. And that, I think, is what the water is doing. It was pulling the layers off of Earth until the point where they finally snapped and started to roll up, for lack of a better term.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003159">00:31:59</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So it&#x27;s going to be a good weekend - let&#x27;s hope. I know we&#x27;re entering into Halloween time, but it shouldn&#x27;t matter much anymore, because without a simulation, they cannot do it. They can&#x27;t do it. Let&#x27;s hope nothing else reappears. I don&#x27;t see anything coming. We&#x27;ve been watching very intently to ensure that nothing is going to stop the Flow from here on out. And I know Source is working His magic here. And hopefully we&#x27;ll have a much better holiday season this year. That&#x27;s the hope.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003236">00:32:36</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">On that note, this has been the GIA Report for the 16th of October, 2025. And hopefully, if anything momentous happens over the weekend, I will do another report - if there&#x27;s any kind of breaking news. I anticipate doing the next report on Monday, simply because I&#x27;m waiting to see and watching intently what&#x27;s happening over the weekend and making sure that we&#x27;re all getting the Flow that we&#x27;ve wanted for a long, long time.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So on that note, have a wonderful day and rest of your day, and I will hopefully see you - if not before - definitely on Monday.</div>
