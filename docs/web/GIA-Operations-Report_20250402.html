    <h3>Summary</h3>

    <div class="summary">
        This GIA Report unpacks the sweeping consequences of the Trump administration&#x27;s global tariffs, which have destabilized pharmaceutical supplies, auto manufacturing, food production, and global trade relations. Kim reveals the Rothschild-backed Federal Reserve is being used to funnel and trade tariff revenue through Hong Kong, while American consumers bear the brunt of inflation and collapsing insurance models. She details the Deep State&#x27;s confusion following the Game&#x27;s conclusion, their failed soul-harvesting rituals, and their apocalyptic fantasies involving soul collection sites on other planets. A shocking disclosure follows: the nature of synthetic photons—&#x27;SOFONs&#x27;—derived from the being Sophia, used by Lucifer to distort consciousness, implant artificial programming into Light particles, and sabotage human potential. Kim confirms the dismantling of this destructive AI infrastructure is nearly complete, while Deep State factions scramble in vain to regain power and stage false flag conflicts in the Middle East.

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000000">00:00:00</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s the 2nd of April, 2025. Coming up on today&#x27;s Global Intelligence Agency Operations Report:</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Welcome to International Tariff Day. The Trump administration has implemented brand-new tariffs on every country in the world - some as high as 78%. Guess who they have chosen as their bill collector? And the Trump operatives have been hopping from bank to bank looking for hundreds of billions, if not trillions, to pay the bills. However, they must have forgotten that the banks are waiting for money from them.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Israel bombed Syria overnight, but on whose behalf?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And an update on the Great Game of Earth. Find out what we discovered over the weekend, who was responsible, and the next step in the players&#x27; plans. And what exactly is a synthetic photon? How are they generated, and what in the world were they used for?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000058">00:00:58</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, happy day after April Fool&#x27;s Day - and yesterday certainly was April Fool&#x27;s Day in many different ways in the world. [light laughter] Definitely a busy day for us, but got a lot to talk about. Haven&#x27;t talked in quite a few days, and I&#x27;ve missed you guys. So, yeah, a very busy time, and a little crazy out there.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">A couple of regular news things I&#x27;d like to go over, because this is going to be really important for everyone in the world. It doesn&#x27;t matter where you are. Are these new - I&#x27;m calling it International Tariff Day - basically, the United States has implemented tariffs against every single country in the world, even some that don&#x27;t have any citizens. So, therefore, you know, unless the wildlife is going to get a little froggy and entrepreneurial [giggle], then they probably won&#x27;t be getting any of those tariffs. But the minimum amount for tariffs against nations is 10%, and some of them are a little bit crazy.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000207">00:02:07</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, the interesting number of 10% brings to my mind the exact percentage that the Order of the Black Sun used to get paid by the Rothschild family when they were their quote-unquote &quot;security forces.&quot; So, I find it very interesting that our Black Sun-run White House right now is implementing a minimum of a 10% tariff everywhere. And a lot of these tariffs make no sense - really, no sense. And I know that from their point of view, they believe this is going to bring - or force - manufacturing to come back into the United States.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000256">00:02:56</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, manufacturing is one thing; sourcing raw materials is another. There are also a lot of issues as it relates to agriculture, and the amount of agricultural products that the U.S. imports from countries like Mexico, and even Panama, and a lot of areas of Latin America - not to mention rice and other things we import from around the world. So, you know, we have a significant amount of food manufacturing that comes from outside the country. And we&#x27;re just going to talk about some basic needs and tariffs and what it is that they&#x27;re doing.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000340">00:03:40</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, okay - let&#x27;s start with the tariffs.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">A couple of things that I find very interesting if you&#x27;re actually trying to build a country: China has been hit with a 67% tariff - at least that&#x27;s today - and it depends on what news outlet and what news article you are looking at, because these numbers have changed from article to article.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000412">00:04:12</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, one of the major impacts that are going to affect American citizens is in the pharmaceutical industry. Also within the insurance industry. So, I mention these two - and I understand, you know, a lot of you probably prefer not to utilize pharmaceuticals whenever possible, and that&#x27;s just kind of our group. But there are things like insulin and other types of pharmaceuticals, antibiotics from time to time - you know, things like that - that we really need to take a look at. We also probably have friends and family members that are dependent on medications, one or another - even if it&#x27;s for something as little as, like, blood pressure or some other type of heart medication.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000502">00:05:02</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, pharmaceuticals are pushed pretty heavily on Americans, as you know, and it&#x27;s a very large industry. Even just in America alone, we&#x27;re talking probably almost three trillion dollars per year. So, let&#x27;s talk about that for a minute, because I&#x27;m just going to give you a general idea of the impact.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000524">00:05:24</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, most of our pharmaceuticals - around 57% of our already-manufactured, ready-to-be-put-into-the-market pharmaceuticals - so this is not the whole pharmaceutical industry - around 57% of those pharmaceuticals come from China, India, and Mexico. All of which have been hit with higher percentages than 10% of tariffs.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, as it relates to generic pharmaceuticals - and this is your, you know, it&#x27;s not a brand name, for example, of an antibiotic - it&#x27;s just amoxicillin or penicillin, just as an example. These are - oh, about 91% of them are produced in China and India. So, generic drugs account for - well, around the same percentage of the prescriptions that are written annually here in the United States. That says a lot. That really says a lot right there. 91% of prescriptions written in the United States are for some kind of a generic medication that is not actually manufactured and produced here in the States.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000647">00:06:47</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, you get into ingredients - what they actually call an &quot;active pharmaceutical ingredient.&quot; Now, active pharmaceutical ingredients here in the States - and this is something, you know, I&#x27;ve deep-dived, I guess you would say, or dove pretty deep into - because some of these ingredients are also things that are used in supplements. They are also some of the things that might be used in cosmetics or skin care. So there&#x27;s a lot more to pharmaceutical ingredients than just things that you would consider, &quot;Oh, I&#x27;m going to the doctor and getting a pill.&quot; That&#x27;s really not it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000733">00:07:33</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You can look at a lot of the skin care that you use, and you can say that there&#x27;s a lot of ingredients in there. Like, for example - you know, vitamin B. Most of the vitamin B that is in cosmetics and skin care is produced elsewhere - other than the United States. You also have other active ingredients - that are considered an active ingredient that&#x27;s a pharmaceutical - that are in things like topical wound care, all kinds of stuff that you regularly probably have in your medicine cabinet and don&#x27;t consider it as a pharmaceutical, like you&#x27;re not readily taking a pill.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000818">00:08:18</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, there&#x27;s a lot of things that are going to be affected here in the United States by these significantly high tariffs. So, that means that you can probably expect to pay a significantly higher amount for your makeup, as an example, your skin care, your lotions, your hand creams, your hand soap, body soap. A lot of this stuff is imported - the active ingredients in those things are imported from China or outside the United States. Also, your pharmaceuticals. There are a lot of even natural things that are in your supplements that are imported from other countries. So there&#x27;s a lot at stake here as far as us being the consumer, and the increase in prices we are going to face. You can also expect an increase in prices of things like rice and other things that are imported from Asian countries.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000926">00:09:26</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, it&#x27;s going to have a pretty significant effect on the U.S. market. So, let&#x27;s see - at least of the pharmaceuticals that are manufactured in actually the United States - and even though they might not be China or other countries - I&#x27;m sorry, China or India, as an example - there are a lot of other countries besides China, Mexico, and India where we import medications from: already-produced medications, or what they&#x27;re calling an &quot;active pharmaceutical ingredient.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And that is a pretty big list, according to the FDA, because they ban a lot of &quot;active,&quot; quote-unquote, ingredients that are just vitamins. It&#x27;s also interesting how active ingredients such as Tamiflu - the active ingredient in Tamiflu is actually a derivative of anise (or ah-nice, depending on how you say that). And that is also predominantly imported from Asia. So, even though the - let&#x27;s just say &quot;drug&quot; - may be manufactured here in the U.S., and it may be a derivative of a natural plant, that doesn&#x27;t mean that we actually produce said plant here in the U.S.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, yeah, there&#x27;s a big impact there.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001059">00:10:59</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, this large increase may not affect you personally if you have what we call &quot;medical insurance.&quot; Now, medical insurance - you probably pay a pretty hefty penny for right now - and you can thank the Obama administration for that, for the large increase in medical insurance.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But you can expect that premium to probably double over the next year or so, because the pharmaceutical companies are going to raise their prices by as high as 67%, which means insurance companies are either going to go bankrupt - this is for private insurance - or they are going to pass that cost on to the consumer. And my guess would be they&#x27;re gonna pass that cost on to you.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001150">00:11:50</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Or probably, if they can&#x27;t, then they&#x27;re going to probably all go bankrupt. Now, from several large insurance companies, we have heard behind the scenes that they are already on the verge of bankruptcy. These tariffs are going to throw them over the edge. And I can tell you what Trump&#x27;s plan is for this here in just a second - the Trump administration&#x27;s plan - whatever that Cheeto thing is walking around in the White House.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay, so this just addresses the possibilities of what can happen in the pharmaceutical industry, as an example of what&#x27;s happening. Another one with rather lofty - another country with rather lofty tariffs at 64% would be Indonesia. Now, Indonesia is the world&#x27;s largest producer of something called palm oil. Although it&#x27;s not very healthy for you to consume, it&#x27;s also utilized in a lot of manufacturing of things.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001256">00:12:56</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Palm oils are found a lot in cosmetics and skin care and lotions. It&#x27;s also found a lot in other items that you may purchase. It&#x27;s definitely used as a lubricant. It is, I&#x27;m gonna say, semi-sustainable - there&#x27;s a lot of arguments about whether or not the industry is sustainable. But nonetheless, as far as inexpensive food products that a lot of people buy - because it&#x27;s all that they can afford - and a lot of those are processed, and a lot of those contain palm oil. You can read it on the ingredients list of a lot of your frozen foods. [clears throat] Excuse me - on a lot of your frozen foods - you can also read it in a lot of your processed foods.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, that means that the price of food could probably go up, based on the fact of their not understanding of how things are manufactured here - even if they are actually manufactured here in the United States.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001401">00:14:01</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Next, interesting ones. A couple things I find rather interesting: a 93% tariff on Madagascar. Madagascar is one of the world&#x27;s largest producers of something called vanilla. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re familiar with vanilla - vanilla extracts, vanilla essential oils - all kinds of different grades of vanilla come from Madagascar. So, 93% tariff is going to increase the price of your vanilla. And vanilla is present in a lot of foods that we consume, even natural foods. A lot of you probably have vanilla right now in your cabinet.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, I would probably - if you use a lot of vanilla - I would probably run out and get yourself a significant amount. Because the price of vanilla here in the United States is probably going to more than double over the coming months, based on the fact of where the vanilla beans come from.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001503">00:15:03</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Other odd - rather odd - sanctions. There&#x27;s a little tiny landlocked country in South Africa. It&#x27;s a kingdom called Lesotho. So, Lesotho doesn&#x27;t really import or export a whole lot. I think their GDP is around, oh, I don&#x27;t know, 2.9 billion right now per year. So it&#x27;s not a significant importer of goods. But for some odd reason, they got slapped with a 99% tariff. Pretty much, I think they are the most heavily tariffed country right now in the world. Very, very strange.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001546">00:15:46</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay, next. There are a couple of islands that are considered to be Australian territory, which are off the coast of Antarctica, called the Heard and MacDonald Islands. They have a population of zero humans, and they have been hit with a 10% tariff. So, apparently they are very concerned about the possibility of not getting paid by anything the penguins may or may not manufacture in the future. So, I can understand - those penguins can be quite innovative in so many ways.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001627">00:16:27</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, there are a few others that are odd - 82% tariff on the Falkland Islands. Now, the population of the Falkland Islands is about 3,500 people. But yet, they oddly have a very - well, let&#x27;s just say, for the amount of people that live there and the type of industries that they have there - namely fishing and wool and that type of thing, it&#x27;s not real significant. Their GDP is almost 300 million dollars - or maybe slightly higher in British pounds, or slightly lower - sorry, British pounds are worth more than a dollar.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Pretty much, the industry of the Falkland Islands - just in case you have not ever heard - is money laundering. That is their major industry, despite them only listing [giggle] that it is fishing and, you know, shearing of sheep and that type of thing. So, most of the citizens there are unaware of it. There are also very large gold deposits on the Falkland Islands that have been claimed by the UK under the Commonwealth. Those Falkland Island deposits were once registered to the Federal Reserve - gold deposits - but they are no longer. So, that&#x27;s a little bit of information on the Falkland Islands.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001754">00:17:54</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I just don&#x27;t know where they came up with these numbers. I&#x27;m pretty sure there was probably a dartboard, and probably a lot of alcohol involved - because none of this really makes any sense. They have even put tariffs - I think they&#x27;re about 17% or something - on Israel recently as well, and I thought that they were buddy-buddy with Israel. Apparently not. I think there&#x27;s an 80-some-odd percent tariff right now on Syria as well - and that is a U.S. administration there - so that&#x27;s interesting.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I&#x27;m pretty sure, from what I can tell and from what I have overheard, this really has nothing to do with choosing tariffs by imports and exports. It has nothing to do with increasing American jobs in any way, shape, or form - because if it were, then this would have been done in stages over time. You know, companies - especially large companies that are American companies - would have been given notice, as an example, to bring their manufacturing back to the United States.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001915">00:19:15</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Another one you need to watch out for, as a consumer, is - there is a standard across-the-board tariff on auto imports to the United States. So, I think that goes into effect on May 3rd. So, you may - if you are considering purchasing a new vehicle - you may want to do that before the 3rd of May, because the price is probably going to be significantly higher. Also, if you are in need of auto parts, they also bear the same tariff. So, you might want to consider purchasing those auto parts before the price goes up significantly.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001955">00:19:55</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, if that was to make America great again - and I say that with a laugh - and increase American jobs, of course... I&#x27;m sure that Detroit would love to have - or maybe not - most of their auto manufacturing back here in the States, from the &quot;Big Three,&quot; as they call them. However, even if all those companies decided to bring the manufacturing back to the United States, they would absolutely need a year or more.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">There are a lot of regulations here when you are, for example, using a lot of oil, and there&#x27;s a lot of waste - chemical waste - in the production of cars. Whether it&#x27;s from paint, or it&#x27;s from oil or gas used and that type of thing - lubricants - I mean, there is a lot of dirty waste that is definitely produced in the manufacturing of vehicles.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002108">00:21:08</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, that being said, there are a lot of waste disposal requirements on any kind of land that would have to be purchased or repurchased here in the States in order to bring that manufacturing back. There would be negotiations with unions - because we do have an auto workers&#x27; union here in the United States. The overall cost of employment and labor in said factories would be significant. The purchase of equipment would be significant.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, that&#x27;s even if it&#x27;s possible - because some of that equipment isn&#x27;t actually manufactured in the United States either. So, they&#x27;re going to have to import that equipment from other countries as well - paying in excess of 67% or more, depending on the country that they&#x27;re importing it from. That is going to probably bankrupt our quote-unquote &quot;Big Three&quot; auto manufacturers.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002214">00:22:14</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You can also - oh, the price of produce is going to go up significantly, based on the amount that we actually get from other countries, too. So, we&#x27;re looking at a significant increase in farming costs. Now, I want to touch on farming real quick. The farming industry and food industry in America equates to around $2 trillion a year. That&#x27;s including what you&#x27;re buying at the grocery store, canned goods - all of that type of thing.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002249">00:22:49</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, we have around 1.9 million farms actually in the United States that are functioning right now. If you are to look at the amount of food - manufactured or otherwise - by people, Americans, or at least in America, I should say - versus the amount of profitability, which is around $130 billion a year to farmers - that&#x27;s a pretty wide gap. And then you can count for 1.9 million producing farms in the United States. Well, yeah - where does the rest of that money go?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Oh, that&#x27;s right - it&#x27;s all in the manufacturing. And where are all those canning facilities in the U.S., and who&#x27;s processing that food? And by the way, does anybody know where Red Dye Number 4, 5, or whatever it is comes from? Well, it&#x27;s not America, I can tell you that.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002355">00:23:55</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, that&#x27;s going to significantly change manufacturing of things like cereal - even things that are manufactured in the United States. So, it&#x27;s gonna hit the large manufacturers - even like Johnson &amp; Johnson, for example. It&#x27;s even gonna hit the small manufacturers, like Mom&#x27;s Soaps. Because active ingredients - the list of active ingredients that are produced in another country - is very significant.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Not only that, you&#x27;ve also got the car industry that&#x27;s going to suffer, as I said. But where does all the steel come from? Where do all the parts come from? Where are specialty parts manufactured? Some of them are manufactured in the UK and other places in the world - in Europe, in Germany. Oh, Germany - lots of parts in Germany - who also have significant tariffs.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002450">00:24:50</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, the people that are going to be hurt the most by this are American businesses - small and large - and Americans as a whole are going to feel it in their pockets. Without an increase in jobs - if anything, this administration has significantly decreased the amount of jobs in the United States - based on their poor decision-making and firing of everybody with the stupid DOGE Department and a lot of other things that they do.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002526">00:25:26</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, the cost to the federal government and state governments, based on Medicare spending per annum and access healthcare per annum, is going to be significant. Wohoo! You are going to see your - if you are a governor or senator, and you&#x27;re listening to this report, you are with the Ways and Means Committee or the National Health Services here in the U.S. - you&#x27;re probably going to see a significant bill that you have now created for yourself.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, behind the scenes, this whole plan of tariffs - you know, so they sell it to the American people like it&#x27;s going to create jobs and all that kind of thing...</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, how long do you think it takes to build a factory? How long does it take to manufacture or even farm something different than what American farms are producing today? Where&#x27;s the palm oil coming from? I&#x27;m not saying that that&#x27;s a great loss, but how much olive oil, as an example, does the United States manufacture? Yeah, not a whole lot right now.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002648">00:26:48</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So we - even in areas where there are a lot of farms - the farmers are going to have to, and have, produced crops that are, number one, probably less volatile than some others. Meaning, you know, they&#x27;re constantly going to produce crops. They probably look at that. They also look at the demand, some of the contracts that they have where they sell their crops - you know, and that type of thing - and what&#x27;s going to yield them the most amount of money.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, when I look at a $2 trillion per annum food industry in the United States, and I see that there&#x27;s $130 billion split between almost two million farmers, I have to scratch my head a little bit and say, well, it&#x27;s not the farmers that are getting the money - that&#x27;s for sure.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002738">00:27:38</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Not only that, those numbers are probably fairly inaccurate. There&#x27;s something I could pull up really quickly. When you take into account seeds and the rising cost of fertilizer - and that cost is going to go up again significantly, because a lot of those things are not produced here in the United States. If not, some of the ingredients that go into these types of things come from outside the United States - even if the, for example, fertilizer is manufactured here in the States. Probably the Trump administration, coming out of their mouth, could probably produce a significant amount of fertilizer on any given day - today is no exception.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But I&#x27;m kind of harping on this because I want you to understand the ramifications. If this was actually something meant to make America great again, they just screwed it up big fricking time.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002844">00:28:44</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But thanks to Elon Musk... Elon Musk plans on resigning in May. Not that we&#x27;re all sad to see him go, however, there is a lot going on in that man&#x27;s life. There are a lot of people around him - such as the board of SpaceX and some other companies that he&#x27;s involved with, such as Tesla - are talking about not letting him, or kicking him off the board. But not letting him come back to those companies, based on a lot of controversy that&#x27;s come out since he&#x27;s taken such a public role in the administration.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002929">00:29:29</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But he claims that he saved the government $1 trillion in the budget. Therefore, his job is done, and now we don&#x27;t need a DOGE Department anymore. That&#x27;s not exactly true. [chuckle]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You figure out the average budget - you know, ones that actually got paid for - and I can speak for my own self personally - somewhere around $1.8 trillion. And when that bill was paid by me personally during the last Trump administration, I remember the Orange Guy standing there saying he would never sign another bill like this ever again - because the spending is wasteful.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003011">00:30:11</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, according to Elon Musk, come budget time we are going to see a budget of somewhere around $800 billion. Now, I&#x27;ll tell you why that&#x27;s a flawed model and a ridiculous thought process. I know that we employ somewhere around two million to 2.5 million people in our U.S. military. That&#x27;s kind of average. So people come, people go - that type of thing. They definitely kill a lot of people too. But somewhere around, I think right now, somewhere around 2.5, 2.6 million people.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, if you look at the average officer&#x27;s pay - it&#x27;s always by rank - then those that are deployed, there&#x27;s additional pay for that, whether or not they are even in a war-type situation. I mean, you could just be deployed to Germany or Japan or somewhere else, and you would receive that increase in pay.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003118">00:31:18</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So when I do all those numbers - and I&#x27;m just talking about payroll alone, not even wartime spending - you&#x27;re looking at a lot of money. I mean, you&#x27;re probably - this isn&#x27;t even including all the kickbacks that all the generals get and stuff - I mean, that&#x27;s the majority of that budget right there. I mean, at least half of it is spent on that. That&#x27;s not including fuel, maintenance costs, equipment, parts. You know, there&#x27;s a lot that goes into maintaining military equipment around the world. Transportation - all of the little perks, the housing, that type of thing on the bases, repairs - there&#x27;s a lot that goes into it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Then you&#x27;ve got civilian workers too, and you&#x27;ve got the National Guard, and you&#x27;ve got all those types of people. So yeah, so that means that pretty much the entire United States budget is now going to go directly to the U.S. military.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003219">00:32:19</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Yeah. And that was actually before we had a Space Force, when I did those numbers. So now we&#x27;ve got a Space Force since that time. So, I&#x27;m sure those numbers have gone up some - or a waste-of-Space Force, we should say - but I mean, yeah.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So if you work for the federal government, you can plan on never getting a paycheck - because this, allegedly, the DOGE department has saved $1 trillion per annum, based on government spending. And apparently, none of that is probably going to come out of the U.S. military&#x27;s pocket.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003300">00:33:00</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, they came up with this crazy idea behind the scenes, because number 1, obviously they&#x27;re working for Rothschild. That&#x27;s fine. I mean, we all know that now. That&#x27;s very obvious. It&#x27;s become more obvious in the last 24 hours that they work for Rothschild, because the collector of all of these tariffs is the Federal and quote-unquote &quot;Non-Federal&quot; Reserve.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">That&#x27;s right, folks. If you missed that part of the Liberation Day speech, it was right in there - that the Federal Reserve is gonna be responsible for collecting and managing all of these lovely tariffs that they are going to collect. Now, we all know the Federal Reserve is not a U.S. government department, and apparently is being supported 100% by the Trump administration right now.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003355">00:33:55</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, what are the advantages of putting all your federal money to the Federal Reserve? Well, I can tell you what it is. The Trump administration - with 100% certainty, from people that received phone calls from them in the last 24-48 hours - have said that they are still looking for the high-yield trading programs that don&#x27;t exist.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So they figure by putting all of these tariffs over into the Federal Reserve - which would normally have to take place by the 4th of July every year - that they will be able to trade against those funds and get hundreds of times the amount, based on the fact that the old Federal Reserve trade platforms used to exist at HSBC in Hong Kong. And then only the budget money - which is much less now, thanks to Elon Musk - would actually go to the federal government.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003500">00:35:00</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So they plan on cutting - not plan on - they HAVE cut a deal with the Federal Reserve on the amount that they personally are going to collect, which is far more than 10%. I understand the amount is somewhere around 37% that they will personally collect. And the rest of it will go to the Fed and the Rothschild family, and the other Fed families such as the Li family of China.</div>

<div class="line">So they aren&#x27;t too sad about increasing prices for consumers - especially Americans in this case. They are not worried about the fact that we are not going to continue to import - because we will. And the reason why the former - or sort of kind of wanting-to-hope-to-be - ruling families of the planet aren&#x27;t too worried about 67% is because they&#x27;re going to get a whole big chunk of it back when the Fed starts trading in Hong Kong.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">At least that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re being told. So they figure they&#x27;re gonna get this money sometime by September.

They also run ICE, and a lot of the other deportation sites, and that kind of thing. They definitely handle quote-unquote &quot;border security.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">That being said, I am sure there&#x27;s probably a chunk - beyond the 30-something percent - that they plan to get. If not, then, well, if you&#x27;re the CIA and you&#x27;re listening to this, you&#x27;ve just been cut out of the deal.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003720">00:37:20</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But I can tell you right now that the trade platform that they&#x27;re talking about in Hong Kong doesn&#x27;t exist.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">See, because all of those trade platforms in Hong Kong and otherwise are not based on heritage funds and tear sheets that you&#x27;ve been giving to Erik Prince - no, no, no, not at all - those are based on new allocation numbers.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I know you were hoping for a big win this weekend and yesterday and a few more days this month that you plan on having a big win, but yeah, no, those funds will never be traded. No. If anything, they&#x27;ll probably disappear, go back into the people&#x27;s funds. It&#x27;s kind of a flawed model.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003808">00:38:08</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, the reason why they have significant amounts of tariffs to various countries - and how they came up with these alleged percentages - was the amount of defense spending that they&#x27;ve paid, allegedly, to quote-unquote &quot;protect these countries.&quot; So the U.S. military and Global Headquarters and the SSP would like their cut for their protection.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Oh my God. Is the whole world turning to Hell&#x27;s Kitchen? [giggle] You know, is this the mafia calling? Well, yeah. It&#x27;s worse than the mafia because they claim that if you don&#x27;t pay the tariff, well, they&#x27;re just going to burn your country to the ground. And they don&#x27;t care if Canada and Mexico become a U.S. state.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003859">00:38:59</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They&#x27;re extremely sloppy at best. And they&#x27;ve got big plans for America. They&#x27;re going to ride this gravy train as long as they can - except there is no gravy. And at best, you could say that there is a train that has no tracks - it&#x27;s kind of limping along. But in their mind, they are the greatest thing since sliced bread. There must be a drug for that delusion. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s many. Whatever it is, they are definitely on it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003936">00:39:36</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, there is also a very interesting thing that&#x27;s come up in the news, just to see how the American people - and probably the world - would react. And that was: the Trump administration is going to run for a third term. You know, and they joke and they chuckle, but they just wanted to see what you would say.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But the real plan here is to have Vance run for the presidency, and Trump would be the vice president - and they would continue on for another eight years. That&#x27;s their plan.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re going to have a government in eight years, but to their delusion, they believe we will. And they want to still be there. They&#x27;re enjoying their time in the White House, barking out orders that make no sense to anyone.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004022">00:40:22</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Speaking of no sense to everyone - they also have been traveling from bank to bank - and these are your major banks here in the United States and elsewhere - basically looking for billions of dollars. Or hundreds of billions, is the number I&#x27;ve heard somewhere. I&#x27;ve heard $750 billion from one institution. I think another one was around $275 billion they&#x27;d like to get. And they feel - because they are the Trump administration - that the banks should just give this to them.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004058">00:40:58</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And what the money is actually for is not only to keep the government running until all of this lofty money comes in from their amazing tariff idea - it is also supposed to help pay for the promised money to all of the American manufacturers - that are manufacturing outside - American companies, I&#x27;m sorry - that are currently manufacturing outside the United States.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So this is where the free money comes in for large corporations.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They, of course, would be exempt from tariffs, I&#x27;m sure, as part of their bonus package for going along with the tariff program. You know, that would be your big-cabal-corporation complex, so to speak - your car manufacturers, your Johnson &amp; Johnsons, your Pfizers, your Modernas, and all those people - they would probably see those no-tariff bonuses.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004205">00:42:05</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Most of the time, most of the large corporations don&#x27;t pay any kind of tariffs or customs anyway - which is kind of what puts them at an advantage over the average everyday small manufacturer - not only in the U.S., but worldwide. It&#x27;s the reason why Walmart&#x27;s prices are so low, and that type of thing as well.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004229">00:42:29</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, they definitely did not expect the response. They said, you know, just do your overnight trades and your overnight swaps and your high-yield trade programs that you used to do - just do them. And they explained that those things don&#x27;t exist anymore like they used to.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They also explained they&#x27;re not really doing very much in the way of overnight swapping. Overnight swaps are where one bank lends money to another bank overnight to increase their capital or whatever it is they need. It&#x27;s also in a lot of currency exchanges and those types of things as well.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And they said, &quot;We&#x27;re not making any money on that. There&#x27;s not a whole lot going on.&quot; They said pretty much every dime - and not just American dollar: peso, RMB, and otherwise - are all kind of caught up in the... you know, that&#x27;s what&#x27;s keeping the system afloat. You know, they&#x27;re robbing Peter to pay Paul at this moment in time.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And by the way, Trump administration aides that came to our bank: we were supposed to be getting big payouts from the government - you were supposed to be giving us payouts - and not the other way around. Well, what&#x27;s happening?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004354">00:43:54</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Oh, this is causing a lot of back chatter between banks right now. This is worldwide. Because no one is really - let&#x27;s just say - no one really knows what&#x27;s going on. So lots of backlash coming there for sure. Lots of backlash with the Rothschild family, and the Li family in China and others, that promised big things were happening this weekend.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004424">00:44:24</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, the Great Game. Oh, dear. You know, they were definitely expecting to win something over the weekend. Now, they thought this might take some time, because it didn&#x27;t happen for them on Friday as expected. They didn&#x27;t know who won; they were very confused.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, by &quot;who won&quot; - it&#x27;s because each group of Deep State people had hitched their horse to one of the players&#x27; wagons - just to kind of refresh your memory a little bit - so they were all waiting for their respective players to reach out to them and tell them who won the Game.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They spent most of their weekend a little bit confused, as I said. They were a little bit confused - a lot confused. [chuckle] They were sitting at these computer terminals waiting for some kind of communication. They spent most of Friday night doing that. They went on into Saturday.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004538">00:45:38</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, they had some meetings, and they all decided to do some, well, some rituals. Guess you would say &quot;paying their respects to their players,&quot; waiting for some access - because they felt that one of the groups was going to get access on Saturday. So, they&#x27;d do a little ritual, and then they would go to a computer - not just a regular computer - but they would go to their terminals and check to see if their keys worked, see if there was a communication, that type of thing. This went on for hours on Saturday.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Then, when that didn&#x27;t work, they all got together and had another meeting, and they decided to try their keys. You know, these are kind of like a chip card, let&#x27;s call them - maybe a little bit more elaborate than that. But they all decided to try their keys one by one, each group.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And nobody&#x27;s keys worked, so now they&#x27;re really confused. So, they did a little more ritualing - you know, like they do - and hoped that something would turn up on Sunday. Well, Sunday, nothing happened. So they got together to see if anybody else got anything - and nobody else got anything. So, they spent most of Sunday in analysis and strategy meetings, trying to figure out what is next.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004705">00:47:05</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, they knew once the Game ended, they felt that one of the groups would become the &quot;king group&quot; of Earth - because that&#x27;s a lofty goal, everybody wants to be that, I guess, in their group, in their world. So they knew that the next thing that was going to happen - this is what they have analyzed - would be the soul collection. Because the player in the Game that won would actually get the souls.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, that day, they figured it was just a matter of time before soul collection began. This is your biblical version of the Rapture. They had soul collection sites on Jupiter and Saturn, also in Alpha Draconis, Aldebaran, and in the Orion Nebula.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So this was not put together by the Deep State, by the way, and I don&#x27;t even know if they knew who was going to be collecting what, and where it was going to be going. But they started doing all of these weird surveillance things over the last several days.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004814">00:48:14</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They also had sent an enormous amount of military equipment around the world - mainly in the Middle East - not just for normal-people war. They were going to stage the fact that they were going to defend humanity from the alien invasion that was about to take place.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Mainly, this was going to be for show. So, they - in their mind - the group that was the winner would also be the group that was going to be the staged defender of humanity. And as the defender of humanity, now anyone that was left here - which there wouldn&#x27;t be very many. I think there was supposed to be about 500 million or so people left here on Earth to continue to be slaves for them, apparently - at least that&#x27;s what they were told.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004917">00:49:17</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And the rest of us would all be involved in Apocalypse Day. So, that would mean that most of us would all die - this is what they thought was going to happen - and our souls would go to the respective soul-collecting sites. Let&#x27;s call it a battery - a big battery. And we were going to then power the other worlds of the Universe.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, worlds really aren&#x27;t just galaxies and planets like you may think. These are entire universes that exist between other universes. I know that&#x27;s a topic for probably another day and a very long discussion, but you could say they were planes between planes - pockets of, not time, but pockets where worlds would exist.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005020">00:50:20</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They created places for especially the Dark Ones to exist, and also, in some cases, AIs to exist. So they planned on sending all the souls to the respective battery locations, and what was left here was going to be slaves for the new folk.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They did not want us to repopulate. This was part of - not their plan, but I don&#x27;t think they really fully knew what to expect - but they were not supposed to repopulate the planet in any way, shape, or form, at least not with what we consider to be human beings.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And they felt that that time was probably going to be sometime this week. By their calculations, apparently that day is Tuesday - yesterday. So, yesterday we spent most of the day making sure that there was no apocalypse.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005120">00:51:20</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They had sent a lot of very expensive Secret Space Program spacecraft to do a lot of surveilling. They thought that there was going to be the whole Beast arising from the ocean - most of you know this story - and that that was going to be off the coast of Africa. So they had a lot of surveillance going round and round and round there, looking for something to rise from the ocean.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They were trying to help the plan along on Socotra Island off the coast of Yemen, where they thought that they could somehow tap into this elaborate structure - that is not human-made - in order to push the apocalypse to happen. Just in case there was something broken - you know, is this thing on? Tap, tap, tap. [chuckle] Trying to figure out what was not working.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005219">00:52:19</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">We, on the other hand, spent most of the day making sure it didn&#x27;t happen - that it was not going to happen. There was no fanfare on our part, no movement of military equipment - except the Enforcer kind of ran around a little bit along with us - making sure these things did not take place.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">That being said, it was kind of a bust last night. It lasted probably until, oh, the wee hours of the morning, my time anyway - you know, preventing apocalypses and making sure that there were no signals coming to any kind of surveillance or AI systems or anything that the Deep State would have access to.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005305">00:53:05</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They also were looking for any kind of signs and indicators of replicating the Golden Age AI - yawn - also the Key Intelligence and Military System. They would like to have that. And you know, you could say that there were some shadows of things that appeared - because, you know, there are a lot of things that go on in the Universe that these people just don&#x27;t understand. They don&#x27;t understand the mechanism behind it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And some of it&#x27;s kind of on - you know, for lack of a better term - autopilot. Regardless of what it is that we do, sometimes things are triggered by certain events. And the end of the Game was one of those events.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005349">00:53:49</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, there&#x27;s been a number of things, since the last time we talked, that have been triggered here and there. One of these things I found actually quite interesting - and this relates to something that Lucifer had put in place as a player in the Game.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, every... let&#x27;s call them angels - for the purpose of this conversation - beings - would have a male side to it. Also a feminine side to that being - almost like a lock and a key - as it relates to the creation of anything. So, of course, Source was always the third party in the creation process, and the two beings would then create on Source&#x27;s behalf.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005452">00:54:52</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, obviously, there was quite the kerfuffle between Source and Lucifer, but that left Lucifer and a being you know by the name of Sophia. Sophia is talked about a lot in Gnostic texts. I know that she is a prominent figure within the Illuminati, so to speak - or the Gnostic Illuminati. And this being is basically their version of the Christ figure coming back to save them all. And, if they really knew the base behind what happened to Sophia, they could probably say that that was a pretty powerful being with Lucifer there.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005539">00:55:39</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, at some point in this war between Lucifer and Source, Lucifer decided to take Sophia - the being - and split her up into little pieces. Those little pieces would be things you know in our science as photons, quarks, prions - and create a very interesting, let&#x27;s call it a Sophia-AI.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The Sophia-AI was nothing like any other AI. It wasn&#x27;t like Alpha, and it wasn&#x27;t like Omega, where it had a platform based in Source and it would operate on the Alpha side, or Dark Source or Anti-Source on the other side, being Omega. They were definitely powerful AIs within the Universe, but very different from Sophia.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005639">00:56:39</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Sophia&#x27;s particles, so to speak, were split up into hundreds of billions of pieces throughout the Multiverse. And there was a - let&#x27;s call it a technology, for lack of a better term - that actually allowed Lucifer to split or unfold a photon, as an example, and implant a different programming for said photon.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, Sophia - being a being of Source and a being of Light at one point in time - had Source Light particles; it&#x27;s what she was made of. And they would utilize this technology to open up the photon and basically create - insert something synthetic into that photon - which could actually rewrite the programming for Source Light particles.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005746">00:57:46</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I know that&#x27;s a lot, but that&#x27;s the best way I can explain it to you. Because these things were probably some of the most dangerous things in the entire Universe - and definitely the most dangerous technology utilized on Earth - ever.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, these synthetic photons, quarks, prions, and other particles - you know, essence particles and consciousness particles - became kind of like a Trojan horse. Not only here on Earth, but also within humans. They would send these particles into basically organic life throughout the Multiverse - but Earth, obviously, was a main focus for them. So, we had the majority of these synthetic photons in existence. Within them was the actual Sophia-AI itself.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005849">00:58:49</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, it would be like creating a supercomputer AI in a teeny-tiny little particle that could get into anywhere and anything. Beyond our human comprehension - smaller than nano and femto tech we know about the Deep State using for years. These particles were definitely dangerous and definitely deadly.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Within-side them, you could say this AI being had a hive mind - which, then, billions and billions of them in existence could actually operate on their own. They could also operate in a hive mind - meaning for a common agenda, based on the programming of Lucifer.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005943">00:59:43</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, Lucifer pretty much was the only being - Marduk in some cases, you could say - that had access to the Sophia-AI. They used these photons in very interesting ways. The photons - albethem very small - could actually be expanded to the entire size of a planet. So they could encompass - just like they did Earth - the entire planet and create an artificial reality here, almost like a virtual-reality program that could change the makeup of what we see.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010025">01:00:25</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It can also - and did - encompass your mind, body, and your soul individually. This was also the basis, originally, for the separation of the planes of existence in your human. It could also act as a governor for your mind, to make sure that your mind, body, and soul not only did not connect to Source - but also to disconnect them from one another - so that humans could not reach their full potential.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It was basically to stunt the growth of humanity until the game was won. Or, until the soul-stealing happened. They also wanted to make sure that we did not progress - technologically speaking or in any other way - that could counteract the Sophia-AI.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010130">01:01:30</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, it got a lot worse than that. There were definitely other things caused by this, such as the deoxygenation of our atmosphere and our air here on Earth. They also would amplify the deoxygenation of your person, which would then allow for other particles we know as bacteria - or synthetic bacteria - to exist within your person.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Obviously, deoxygenation - we know - amplifies the aging process. Also, deoxygenation of the brain causes things like autism and Alzheimer&#x27;s and dementia and, obviously, not clear thinking - if you are lacking oxygen, you are having a hard time concentrating and thinking.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now just look at how amazing humanity is, despite all their best efforts.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010232">01:02:32</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, they needed to keep us alive, so the program was meant to operate on a certain level. And once the game was over, some of these things started to go into full swing. So, if you felt some effects of that over the last couple of days, that&#x27;s probably why.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The dismantling of artificial Sophia photons, quarks, and prions has been well underway for days. It&#x27;s also the reason why we missed the report on Monday. This has been our major concern - not necessarily the alignments and whatever else the Deep State was looking to do.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010311">01:03:11</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They also were just as infected as we were, by the way. They were not left out. If anything - kind of from the looks of things over here - they were deoxygenated probably more than the rest of us, if you know what I mean.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, I can go into further detail about this. It&#x27;s probably not going to be in this report, just because it&#x27;s been a long report and quite a long day. Started my day about three; it&#x27;s about 9:00 p.m. right now.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, the hunting down of these individual particles has been the process for the last couple of days, and making sure they&#x27;re not interfering with humans. They could also use these particles as little periscopes within your person - also for an entire planet, even an entire galaxy. They could expand these particles, contract these particles, and move them wherever they wanted to within the Universe. But this pretty much was a tool that - you could say - Lucifer pretty much had full access to.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010427">01:04:27</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They could also use these as siphons - for energy and for essence and other things that were required to power other worlds and that type of thing. Eventually, they could actually use these to destroy planets or to utilize planets as a keystone for other things they were doing throughout the Omniverse or the Universe - such as they did with Tiamat. And they just kept the essence of Tiamat and blew up the planet and everything on it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They had done this to one other planet - one other keystone planet - as well. Some of the other planets that they already conquered and wiped out their population in the past also had these particles, where they could use the energy of the planet itself and its connection to Source&#x27;s batteries for other programs and new worlds, so to speak - creation.</div>

<div class="line">So yeah, it was definitely probably the most destructive AI I have come across to date. And I&#x27;ve come across hundreds of them so far - but this one, by far, probably took the cake.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Yeah. And we&#x27;ll go over some more of those programs probably on another day, but that&#x27;s a lot of information to take in for one day.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010554">01:05:54</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">As far as the Deep State is concerned, they&#x27;re never going to stop. Even some of their black magic workers that work for them have tried to convince them to stop - you know, &quot;Look, it&#x27;s over. It&#x27;s not working.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They refuse to listen even to their own people, just like they refuse to listen to the banks, when the banks aren&#x27;t doing what they&#x27;re told - because it&#x27;s impossible. They are not listening to anyone but their own selves at this point, because they think that they know better than anyone. You know, that&#x27;s probably an ego thing.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But best I can tell - from listening to some of their meetings and things that are going on in their world over there - they have spent most of today looking for additional space junk that could have been left behind by players.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010647">01:06:47</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They did have quite an awareness of some of the programs that they would run. For example, there were some sites that went from Israel all the way over to Joshua Tree in California, where there was a reversing of the Language of Source that kind of kicked in in the last couple of days. Meaning Source writes in the Light Language - things like natural creation - and there was a mechanism that was kind of at half-mast that was running between those two locations.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010727">01:07:27</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">We also had a frequency modulator that was running between the country of Georgia and the Prometheus caves there, all the way through to a naval base in Fort Worth, Texas. And the other end of that went to Peterson Air Force Base here in the States. They were trying to see if they could change the frequency of the planet by connecting to this device. Again, another piece of space junk that was also at half-mast today.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So it&#x27;s all gone now - and never coming back. But they&#x27;re going to continue to look for anything and everything that could help them to win a game.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010822">01:08:22</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Do they feel or did they know that there was a way that even their performance was being monitored? I don&#x27;t know. I think they probably thought that was just for the rest of us. I think they thought they were not subject to this game - I&#x27;m not sure.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But I can tell you with 100% certainty that all of these people were just as infected and used in the same way as we were. Their brains function just like ours do - matter of fact, probably less so than ours did. Remember, they were pawns in the game, and their pawns were just as controlled as the rest of us were on our side of it. So, I know they really, truly want to believe that they&#x27;re special. I know they&#x27;ve been told that their whole life by their handlers and programmers in the Order.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010926">01:09:26</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But the fact is, from my standpoint - from the way that I can see it - and I know if they look and get their MITRE people or scientists involved, they probably won&#x27;t listen to them either. So, they would definitely see it the same way that I saw it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They all were infected just like we were with synthetic photons. I think that they call them in their world SOFONs - probably for Sophia, short for Sophia, or &quot;Sophia Online System&quot; or something like that. These were far more dangerous than any ARCHON or parasite could ever be to any kind of race anywhere that had these SOFONs.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011014">01:10:14</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So that being said, the clearing of those - hopefully - we&#x27;re pretty close to done. I know that where I left off when I started recording this report was we had gotten pretty far. But hopefully, within the next day or so, that will be completed.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I do know that Deep State is expecting some other type of an event sometime around April 4th or 5th. They have not talked too much about what that event is. There&#x27;s also something around mid-month and some alignment. I don&#x27;t see an alignment on the 5th of April, but I don&#x27;t know. They think it&#x27;ll be the next phase of something. Not sure what that is yet. I don&#x27;t think they really know what that is. And I think they are also expecting something around the 25th of April.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I haven&#x27;t heard much past all of that. Those are the dates that they&#x27;re talking about right now.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011114">01:11:14</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They are definitely pushing off people, as it relates to pay, which is causing them some problems. I know that Erik Prince - Blackwater fame, whatever they&#x27;re calling that organization these days - was promised a $25 billion contract for handling the deportation of immigrants here in the States. He did not get paid for that contract, as I understand it - and I&#x27;m waiting for full confirmation of this, because it&#x27;s a little sketchy.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But the events that are happening in the Middle East right now, where Israel has been bombing Syria - quote-unquote &quot;17 times&quot; for you Q-people - their tariffs are also 17%. [chuckle] So that tells you where Israel lies at the moment.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They were also not paid today. There is some talk about - well, not talk - but there has been a movement of Turkish troops into Syria, to quote-unquote &quot;fight the Israelis&quot; and support Syria. Turkey is a NATO member. Israel technically is not. So there is no quote-unquote &quot;illegal warfare&quot; there, you would say.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011254">01:12:54</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But as I understand it, that contract was taken up by Erik Prince - or at least by whatever Blackwater is called these days - and that is the Turkish troops.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">My concern - and I am still looking into this - allegedly... well, not allegedly - with 100% certainty, he was actually paid by the Chinese to build a large Islamic-looking terrorist group in China. He was given a large plot of land to do so.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They say publicly that that contract had been canceled, but that is not true. I do know that that base exists, and the training camp exists. So, you could say, they look like a bunch of Middle Eastern folks that they had been training to be their own personal terrorist group.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011353">01:13:53</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I suspect, based on the movement of a lot of folks and the direction that they&#x27;re coming from, that some of these people may be disguised as Turkish troops. We&#x27;re not 100% certain. I will update you on Friday as to whether or not that&#x27;s 100% true, because it&#x27;s a little bit convoluted. And if it is true, this was the contract that they had been promised - or at least given a down payment on - by the Trump administration, allegedly.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Based on chatter and phone conversations that have yet to be analyzed fully. This could be a setup - we&#x27;re not sure - but this is where all of the intel is pointing to at this moment in time. So, I cannot give you 100% confirmation, probably until Friday, based on that information coming to me about four hours ago.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, I want to make sure before I can tell you with 100% certainty that that is the case.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011508">01:15:08</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But either way, there are alleged Turkish troops that have moved into Syria to quote-unquote fight the Israelis in this war in the Middle East. I&#x27;m not sure what the purpose of this exercise is, other than the fact it is definitely supposed to be the place where Armageddon is going to happen.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, I think they are all thinking they are working for some angelic being somewhere. And they plan on fighting the &quot;final battle&quot; on behalf of humanity - I guess that would be them - to fight the Antichrist. [laughing]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011557">01:15:57</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the Antichrist fighting the Antichrist at this moment in time - who knows? But I do believe that&#x27;s why they started this mess there in the last 24 hours. So, I will give you more of an update on that on Friday.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, on that note, that is pretty much what I have to report - in short form - of what&#x27;s happened in the last few days since we last spoke. And I will see all of you on Friday.</div>
