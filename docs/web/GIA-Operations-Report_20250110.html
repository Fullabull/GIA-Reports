        <div class="line">2025-Jan-10 GIA Report</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">00:01</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s the 10th of January, 2025. Coming up on today&#x27;s Global Intelligence Agency Operations Report: As fires rage in California set by the Trump operatives, they try to plan another disaster in today&#x27;s meeting because no money came - and they don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong. And the clock is ticking: only 10 days left until a convicted felon takes the Office of U.S. President. Right now, this administration looks like the Captain of the Titanic.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">00:35</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, it&#x27;s the 10th of January, and, well, it&#x27;s been an interesting week, to say the least. We had the quote-unquote &quot;Carter funeral,&quot; which seemed to go off okay. I know everybody was on alert, and it didn&#x27;t quite - what they wanted to do didn&#x27;t quite happen. There have been some interesting meetings, though, that we&#x27;ve been listening to this morning and this afternoon. This had mainly to do with the fires in California.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">01:08</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">As you know, there&#x27;s been a lot of aid promised from the quote-unquote &quot;federal government.&quot; And the Trump operatives who actually set the fire, they said that they weren&#x27;t sure why the money didn&#x27;t come. And this was the discussion they were having in this meeting. Now in the past - and I mean the past - there was a fund that was there for creating disasters and creating harm and pain. And a lot of that fund that they were referring to or thinking that was going to just open wide would have been under the &quot;Mei Wah Line,&quot; or the &quot;Lilith-Isis Line.&quot; And that hasn&#x27;t existed in a while, and as all of you know, Mei Wah has been gone for some time.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">02:04</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And there was no one to push any button to release any funds except for, well, me. And that didn&#x27;t happen. So they were contemplating in this meeting creating another disaster, maybe a 9/11-type event - something bigger than just fires - where they could declare maybe a national disaster all over the country; something like the World Trade Tower is going down. Maybe some other towers they&#x27;d like to take out. But there are other people in the meeting that are even saying, can they afford to create another disaster?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">02:45</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">What they mean by &quot;afford it&quot; - not just monetarily. How much are the American people going to take? And they&#x27;ve got a very short window to do it in, because there&#x27;s only 10 days left to the inauguration, if it does go off on time. And it&#x27;s not a whole lot of time to plan disasters. You know, fires are cheap, but very expensive in the long run: you have a lot of insurance companies. There was a conversation that happened between Aon Insurance Company and some of our - I think it was Tom, who had the conversation. They were saying that they&#x27;re going broke anyway. Part of the reason why they&#x27;re going broke has to do with issuing of pools and bonds and those types of things on a larger scale. But paying out millions of dollars to homeowners and landowners and business owners is not going to go real well for these insurance companies.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And yeah, there&#x27;s a lot of talk in the mainstream media about increasing, for example, the cost of insurance policies to homeowners, making homeowners pay more, maybe they&#x27;re not able to get homeowners insurance in different parts of California, but that&#x27;s not gonna really solve the problem.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">04:19</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The problem is, is that they already insured all of these homes, and they&#x27;re going to need to pay, which will happen. Even if insurance companies go bankrupt - just as an FYI to you - something that is not made public and definitely not made public to consumers when you buy insurance, is something called a guarantee fund. Now, you might be able to find some information online about it. I am definitely aware of it. And all insurance companies are required to pay into this guarantee fund. And what the guarantee fund does is, in the event an insurance company goes bankrupt, this fund will then kick in and handle the consumer business. It&#x27;s kind of like FDIC insurance, but it&#x27;s not really a federally mandated thing; it&#x27;s more of an insurance association thing, where they all pay into this fund. So I mean I&#x27;m sure the homeowners will end up getting the insurance payouts eventually. You know we&#x27;re two disasters in now, in the last several months, and this is going to be tough for the insurance industry.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">05:43</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And, hmm, maybe it&#x27;s something that needs to change anyway. Maybe we need to change the way we do things. And I look at these things sometimes, and I mean, obviously, people, you know, are going to be very stressed out if the insurance doesn&#x27;t pay on time, or it takes months to get payment, and that type of thing. But there are ways to do things, and everything has its own timing. So we&#x27;re seeing an entire industry wobbling right now based on poor decisions that were made regarding pooling of life insurance policies, pooling of homeowners insurance policies, and pooling of bonds, and writing what they call an &quot;insurance wrap&quot; on bonds, and insuring corporations for bonds, and corporate bonds, and whatnot that were issued.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">06:43</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Behind the scenes, as you know, BlackRock actually went bankrupt. Officially what you saw was a little kerfuffle in Louisiana. Unofficially, they filed bankruptcy and are trying to wipe out a lot of their debt behind the scenes. Now, like I said, this is all steamrolling, because people are not going to be able to wait another six months. There is talk about certain intelligence agencies looking for contingency plans, other ways of working, they say by the summer - I don&#x27;t think it will last that long - and it&#x27;s really starting to wobble. That house of cards is starting to fall. And if they create another disaster, is that going to make money come out? No.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">07:42</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">This is already two, you know, two down. There aren&#x27;t a whole lot of things they can do - and they&#x27;re discussing it right now as I&#x27;m recording this - of things that they could possibly do that would yield them money. And the problem is, is that we&#x27;re down so low in the food chain now, I don&#x27;t think they really get the fact that there was always someone that pushed the money button. Always. Or would convert those numbers on a screen into actual cash with allocation numbers. No one else is left here but me. So I know that they would love to get me to do something, but that&#x27;s not possible. That was proven earlier this week, when security measures kicked in. And local people also kind of declined to work with them too. So I&#x27;m not really seeing much coming out of them.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">08:44</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But what I am seeing is - congratulations Americans, you now have the first convicted felon as a president. [laughing] Apparently, as of today, they went ahead and did the conviction. And I still can&#x27;t get over this part. So they went ahead and convicted him, but there&#x27;s no consequences, no jail time, no nothing. Just, &quot;You&#x27;re a felon now.&quot; And for the rest of us citizens, especially of the United States, I know for a fact: you can&#x27;t work at a bank; you can&#x27;t even work at the Department of Motor Vehicles with a felony conviction. So I&#x27;m not, you know, it&#x27;s really strange that you can become the president.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">09:29</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So if any of you listening to this are convicted felons, this is always a job option for you; you could always run for president for as long as we have a government. So I find that very interesting. You&#x27;ve got 10 days now to the inauguration. We&#x27;ll see if it actually goes down on that date. I say that because they&#x27;re starting to come to some realizations behind the scenes. I don&#x27;t know if there is - who knows? Are they going to go through with it? Are they going to fake a death, and say all those were Trump&#x27;s promises - fake Trump? They&#x27;re definitely having these discussions right now.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">10:15</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Are they thinking about going in another direction, doing something positive for people? No, not in any way. Are there many countries waiting for this to happen? Yes. Are there some terrorist organizations they agreed to pay waiting for this to happen? Yes, you do have the Houthis in Yemen. You&#x27;ve got a couple of groups in Iraq, I know, that are waiting for payment. You have some interesting Iranian groups that are waiting for payment. Lots and lots of people are waiting for payment right now.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">10:49</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And it&#x27;s almost better to just let it go - let them go through with the inauguration. As a matter of fact, force them to go through with the inauguration, and let them deal with the consequences of their big mouth and cowboy talk. There are some people in the government that are like, &quot;Well, we might not go through with it. We might - you know, we don&#x27;t want them in office if they&#x27;re not going to fulfill their promises to us.&quot; I&#x27;m actually hearing this from government people, higher-level government people here in America. And that was my advice to them. Just let it go through. Just let them get in there, let them deal with their own problems, and then we&#x27;ll see. We&#x27;ll see what happens from there.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">11:43</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I&#x27;m really, at this point, watching it because it could cause people problems. I&#x27;m also watching it from a security standpoint: Are people who receive funds from C.A.R.E. to do a project going to be able to spend them and live in a way that is comfortable? That&#x27;s my main concern. For me, I&#x27;ve been kind of stuck here in the Hotel California [chuckling] now for a number of years, and I don&#x27;t want to see that happen to anybody else. So I do watch this for that reason.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">12:25</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I am listening to all the promises in other countries. I am watching the Trump folk pick up plans from the Order of the Dragon, such as a plan I&#x27;ve told you about many times where the world is divided into somewhere around seven - I was told seven was the original plan - different banking sectors, seven banks for international settlements, seven currencies, seven control systems for the entire world. And I&#x27;ve told you about this before. Apparently now that is 10 different divisions. This is something else that they&#x27;re talking about. And if they can divide it up into 10 - there still comes a moment in time where, again, those who held the final key must push the button, even on the ones that they created themselves.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">13:23</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And I&#x27;m not sure if the Trump operatives just feel like they&#x27;re out of options, because they&#x27;re taking plans that were meant for the other side now. Regardless of that, you still end up with me. There&#x27;s no more Marduk, there&#x27;s no more other people, there&#x27;s only me. So again, it doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s going to happen or go anywhere, but there&#x27;s going to be a lot of turmoil. And I&#x27;m hesitant to say some things right now, because, again, these meetings are going on literally as I&#x27;m talking to you, so I have information coming in while I&#x27;m talking to you.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">14:10</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But I would say right now they&#x27;re kind of almost, I&#x27;m hesitant to say &quot;almost,&quot; at a point where they feel like there really isn&#x27;t a whole lot of directions they can go in. And they&#x27;re not sure how to get out of it at this point. That&#x27;s what it looks like to me. A disaster didn&#x27;t work; using somebody else&#x27;s plans is not working. I don&#x27;t know if they know who they&#x27;re trying to appease at this point in time, but the only thing I do know is that as of at least this morning, nobody was discussing turning in our direction.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">14:53</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Meaning by &quot;turning in our direction,&quot; I mean actually willing to walk the walk, you know, take a marker - because that&#x27;s going to be required - and actually do exactly what they say they&#x27;re going to do. So I&#x27;m not really seeing any of that. I&#x27;m seeing them still scraping the bottom of the barrel, trying to figure out what they can do. The rest of it is kind of up in the air because these things are happening in real time right now. I&#x27;ll probably have more information for you on those types of things on Monday.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">15:28</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Monday is also a full moon. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re waiting for something there to happen. I know that on the 15th, they&#x27;re also waiting for something else to happen, which hasn&#x27;t happened in years, as far as financial things to come through. And I talk about financial things a lot with these folks because that&#x27;s pretty much what they&#x27;re missing. They also are having trouble running normal operations as well.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">As far as fires and things of that nature are concerned, we have possibly something that you might see coming up over the weekend, to try to help with that type of thing, because now it&#x27;s just a mess over there. And we&#x27;ll see what we can do there.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">16:15</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But as far as these people, it&#x27;s going to be a hot January. 10 days from now, actually on the 21st, is the day everything&#x27;s supposed to happen. So by the 21st of January, through to the end of the month, possibly the beginning of February, you&#x27;re going to see a lot, and I mean a lot, of turmoil. And there&#x27;s really nothing you can do about the dying animal at this point, and nothing I can do, and nothing I want to do to help the dying animal. But just breathe and just know that if He brings us to it, He&#x27;s going to bring us through it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">16:56</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">As far as on the other side of things, we are still dealing with some remnants that are causing some disturbing frequencies, tones, high-pitched tones, low-pitched tones. This is not something that the Deep State is doing. This is something that the other dying animal - the main enemy that we have - is automatically doing, I would say, in an AI sort of way. As it tries to regain some kind of control and a foothold here on Earth. That&#x27;s not happening. We&#x27;re not having any kind of an invasion situation happen. But there are a lot of attempts for AIs to reinstall themselves here. And of course, dead-man switches and those types of things.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">17:48</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So yeah, I would say off and on it&#x27;s been a little bit uncomfortable over the last couple of days, but it&#x27;s getting less and less. There is a lot less now than there was even two months ago for it to actually do that will affect the humans on the planet. So that&#x27;s a positive thing. As far as the Deep State is concerned, they&#x27;re more concerned with saving themselves than causing us more harm. I don&#x27;t think that they, I don&#x27;t believe they&#x27;re going to create another disaster at this moment. It looks like, you know, cooler heads or saner heads are prevailing in this meeting right now. But they are looking for something else. What that something else is, I don&#x27;t know as of this moment - we&#x27;ll see. The meeting&#x27;s not over, and everybody&#x27;s still talking, and we&#x27;re always on guard anyway.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">18:51</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Other than that, there really isn&#x27;t a whole lot else that I can actually release in the report right now. Hopefully we&#x27;ll have a quiet weekend. Hopefully these fires will start to recede and not continue to grow. Hopefully, families in California, if you are in California, and there are people that are in need of help, if you have the ability to do so, I hope that you, just like you always do as the people - we take care of each other. No one&#x27;s going to come in and save us at this point.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">19:30</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Definitely not these people. They&#x27;d just like to blow something else up and see if money falls out of the sky. So on that note, that&#x27;s pretty much the GIA report for Friday, the 10th of January. I hope all of you have a wonderful weekend, and I will see you on Monday, and hopefully I&#x27;ll have some more information.</div>
