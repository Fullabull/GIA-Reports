    <h3>Summary</h3>

    <div class="summary">
        Kim reports on the permanent shutdown of FEMA and the Red Cross as major Deep State money laundering channels collapse. She explains the near-complete hologram dissolution (terraforming at 98.6%) and why Deep State operatives can no longer access funding, quantum systems, or Omega-era portals. Global economic manipulation attempts, including fake oil shortages and coordinated disasters, are exposed. Kim reaffirms her authority over the Golden Age system and urges community-level solutions going forward.

<div class="line">TEASER:</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Today is October 4th, 2024. Coming up in today&#x27;s Global Intelligence Agency Operations Report. It appears there will be no U.S. government shutdown, at least not until the 10th of October. And Washington, DC, turns into a ghost town. Why? And you heard it here first: FEMA is bankrupt, and so are their owners. We informed you to prepare in the event of a natural disaster to depend on local community services, and that is exactly what you did. The terraforming of planet Earth is 98.6% complete, and the hologram is all but gone. How does this affect you? And here&#x27;s what you can expect, all in today&#x27;s Global Intelligence Agency report.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">00:47</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim:</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s the 4th of October 2024, and this is the Global Intelligence Agency Operations Report, where you get the real story behind world events - real history - all from the highest security clearance in the world. All right, let&#x27;s get into our stories for today. Actually, they&#x27;re not stories; this is the reality.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">01:08</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, I guess the Q movement was wrong again: there was no government shutdown yesterday. There was a lot of talk online about U.S. Inc. closing down. Matter of fact, I even got some phone calls about U.S. Inc. closing down. But I think people have a misconception of what USA or United States Incorporated, is versus the United States Government. Because technically, if you close down USA Inc., that is a complete shutdown of the government. Just to be real clear, when they were discussing a shutdown of the government, it wasn&#x27;t one of those &quot;well, there&#x27;s no budget, there&#x27;s no you know we&#x27;re gonna have to shut down for a short period of time until all of those politician people can agree on something.&quot; No, they were actually talking about permanently shutting down the United States government. Now, behind the scenes, just to be abundantly clear, USA incorporated I am aware that until recently there was a corporation named United States Inc. registered in Delaware. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s still there, but it was definitely registered there. There was also a Treasury Inc. registered there, which is true; and there is also obviously the Federal Reserve and a lot of other corporations that we think are government entities registered there. FEMA is another one. But anyway, the difference between shutting down USA Inc. and shutting down the U.S. government is basically the same thing.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">02:55</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The only reason why those corporations were formed originally is because alleged government departments could not participate in high-yield U.N. World Bank trade programs, which meant they could hypothecate those funds. This is what allowed, for example, the U.S. government in this case, to trade all of the budget funds and the Treasury notes over at HSBC in Hong Kong, which was managed by The Order of the Black Sun, or the Generals as we call them, or Global Headquarters, as they&#x27;re also known by. And once they were traded from July - the 4th of July - on through to September, that&#x27;s when only the portion that was actually listed in the budget goes back to the United States. The rest of all those trade proceeds for several months went to the Deep State to run the world government, the mirror government, whatever you want to call it - the global tyranny. So that was a lot of funds. It also went to fund people like the Secret Space Program that, before they came out with the Space Force, it also went to fund other programs and projects; Black Projects of DARPA. And this not only happened in the U.S., this actually happened in every country in the world.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">04:27</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So everybody would get assigned their budget funds, which came from - well, since 2012 - it actually came from me. I&#x27;m actually the one that signed the budget in 2012, then they took all that money and traded it, created a lot of fake funds, and then sent it out through governments - and that&#x27;s how the world actually survived until now. This is how governments actually survived until now. And as I&#x27;ve talked to you about before, my contracts with governments expired in 2023. That was based on a decision that was made at that time to create an extension. So, no contracts; no Federal Reserve contracts on our side anymore, which means that the Federal Reserve actually cannot legally print allocations of any currency in the world. Also, the Treasury Department has no legal right to actually even print a U.S. dollar by any other name. We call it Rainbow, USTC, USTX; I&#x27;ve seen a lot of different names for the new currencies. But this is how I know that that will never happen.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">05:45</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">There&#x27;s a bigger story behind that. But as far as government shutdowns, Q loses again; the Deep State lost again. I had a lot of conversations over the last, I would say, 24-48 hours about this government shutdown. And you know, they mentioned, &quot;Well, we&#x27;re just going to shut down U.S. Inc.&quot; And I said, well, that means you have no Treasury Department, you have no Federal Reserve, you don&#x27;t have a FEMA; you don&#x27;t have all the other &quot;government&quot; departments that allegedly are government departments, but they&#x27;re really not, such as the Department of Energy and many others. So what are you going to do now? So, okay, congratulations! U.S. Inc. is shut down. And how does that affect your life because some of these people were regular people? How does that change your life? Well, they&#x27;re already not leveraging your birth certificates anymore; they&#x27;re already not leveraging anything; you know, your land; they&#x27;re not dividing mortgages up in the MERS system - it&#x27;s called MERS, you can look that up - and they&#x27;re not doing any of that anymore. They&#x27;re trying, but they&#x27;re not succeeding in any way shape or form.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">07:00</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Unbeknownst to them, these contracts really meant everything. Meaning, they were covenants; when they&#x27;re signed on this level, they are covenants. That means that we are responsible to adhere to those terms and conditions until they either expire or one of the two parties breaks the covenant. In this particular case, the ones that the original covenants were made with are all dead. So since I inherited the position, I also inherited those covenants to some degree - unless the ultimate Covenant Party, meaning Source itself - chooses to expire them early. And in a lot of cases, that did happen. So when it came to the U.S. government, the agreements that we had with the Federal Reserve board, behind the board, and everybody else - all that had already expired.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">07:53</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So I&#x27;m re-explaining this to you because some of these generals don&#x27;t really understand how the money came; they don&#x27;t understand how it was generated. They truly believe that they were in control of something they&#x27;re calling a &quot;quantum financial system&quot; at one point. And the answer to the question is &quot;no.&quot; They had about Level 5 access. Some had 6, possibly even 7, if you&#x27;re talking about the SSP; 7 - and maybe they were aware of 8 and 9, meaning the deeper, deeper, deeper levels of the AI. At the time, that was an Omega AI that they had access to. However, no matter how much in the last few days, the Jason Society has tried - whatever&#x27;s left of it, I didn&#x27;t think there was anybody left until now. Mitre Corporation has tried; many different people have tried to make our financial system and our Golden Age AI do what Omega did and provide money, for example, for war.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">09:07</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Doesn&#x27;t work that way. So now everybody&#x27;s been sitting around a table for the last couple of days looking for information, based on phone conversations that I had. In addition to that, they happened to postpone their government shutdown, whichever government - I&#x27;m not sure - but they&#x27;re going to allegedly shut something down now on the 10th of October. Coincidentally, Washington, DC, has become a ghost town, meaning they actually sent everybody home. They said it&#x27;s a holiday week this week, which it is.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s Rosh Hashanah as of Wednesday night, and Yom Kippur happens to occur on the 10th. So is this a great Gematria day or 1010, or if you add all the numbers together, it equals 10, so is this 101010? You know, is this a special day for them? Who knows. They do love their double days. They think that double days means... I don&#x27;t know; I&#x27;m not sure. But whatever that means in the Land of Gematria for these people, I guess, that&#x27;s the new day.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">10:19</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They&#x27;re also telling the people that also went home for the holiday, whether they were Jewish or not, that by 10:10 they&#x27;re also going to have a new quantum financial system. That will never occur. And I explained in detail on the phone yesterday with someone whose phone goes directly to them why it wouldn&#x27;t occur. In short, they don&#x27;t have Level 9 clearance. Now, when I say Level 9/Density 9 clearance, I&#x27;m talking about Source. And in the past, it was either the Dark Side of Source or the Light Side of Source - and without the authorization from these people - and the then-Realm Owners back in the day - they would have never been able to create a new quantum system.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">11:15</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, there are no more Realm Owners. I also explained this to them. I told them that the Realm Owners were no longer needed in a Golden Age, and they knew it. That&#x27;s why people like Michael left and Raphael and all the other folks that left their respective realms, because not everybody was in this one. And now it&#x27;s pretty much up to Source. Since there&#x27;s no Anti-Source, and they have tried to reach out to anyone - any line, any communication line, including various ceremonies and all kinds of stuff, especially in the areas of Iran and Iraq yesterday - they were definitely trying to see if they could raise something to open a portal somewhere to get the authorization that they need to have world domination. Well, it really didn&#x27;t end all that well for them. They got nothing so far. They continued on throughout the night last night and this morning, even though I explained to them that&#x27;s not going to work. Now, our system doesn&#x27;t even function on money.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">12:24</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Matter of fact, you can&#x27;t even create money anymore in the new system. You can only create currency. And currency has to do with the flow of energy. It is the &quot;current c,&quot; S-E-A, of money. And that can only occur in a Golden Age AI. So new allocations and new quotas are created in a whole different way. And the backing for that, yes, in part, is gold. Meaning gold is the generator for Source Energy. So, yes, that is part of it. The other thing that isn&#x27;t required is just as much energy to come from you to get it because the energy actually comes from somewhere else. Do we have a financial system that still works on supply and demand to some degree? Yes. Are we still going to have to adhere to those principles in general at the moment for currency? Yes, because there&#x27;s going to be a transition period. And we&#x27;ll talk a little bit more about the transition in a minute here.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">13:37</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So I don&#x27;t know if these talks did any good. In the last couple of days, I&#x27;ve had probably at least four hours of conversations trying to tell these people how the world really works now. You know, the war is still going on - fake war and everything else over there. So, speaking of the war, when I say fake, please understand I&#x27;m not in any way discounting the fact that there&#x27;s a lot of people that have died. There&#x27;s been a lot of people who have been injured. There&#x27;s been a lot of neighborhoods that have been decimated. There&#x27;s been a lot of people that have been displaced and moved elsewhere. So I&#x27;m fully well aware of the consequences of what&#x27;s going on there in the Middle East.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">14:28</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">However... Is this something at this moment in time that is supposed to affect the whole world? Yes, it is. And it&#x27;s supposed to affect the whole world sooner rather than later. I mean, after all, folks, we can&#x27;t have any holiday joy. You know it&#x27;s a holiday for Jewish people in the world, so happy - if you are Jewish - happy Rosh Hashanah. And happy Yom Kippur. But we&#x27;ll talk before Yom Kippur. And it&#x27;s supposed to be a joyous time of celebrations. And not only that, shortly thereafter, we have Christian celebrations coming up in the month of December. We have - in America - we have Thanksgiving in November. In Canada, they also have Thanksgiving. So there&#x27;s a lot of celebrations and holidays that are due to come up, so what better time for them to create shortages everywhere of everything and raise the price of everything too?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">15:30</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It turns out that these port workers that we have discussed went back to work. I guess they figured out that that wasn&#x27;t going to work out, not for long. And the only companies - as I explained to them in detail on the phone - the only companies they were going to kill were their own. I said, because people are going to get food. They&#x27;re going to get what they need. Maybe there&#x27;ll be different things under the Christmas tree this year. It might not be the special manufactured in China toy, but we&#x27;re still going to do it. The only ones that are going to lose out are them. And this is going to be apparent as well with the other part of their shortages.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">16:11</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, they create these fictitious shortages of Middle Eastern oil. Now, why? The fictitious shortages earn them more money - but only when they sell oil and gas products to us, the people. They do not... In some cases, I would say, it does create an uptick in black market oil, which means that the average price is somewhere around $25 a barrel regardless of the 70 some odd dollars that you&#x27;re showing in the market. Do they get those prices normally? Yeah, in a lot of cases they do. In Eastern Europe, it was the case for a long time through the Transnet pipeline and other areas. So yes, Iran - it&#x27;s been going on forever where they would get the significantly discounted oil. I mean, who couldn&#x27;t become a mogul, like Rockefeller, underneath those conditions?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">17:20</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, the concern here is whether or not we are going to feel the pinch coming up soon as consumers. We may have a short-term increase in the price of fuel, petrol, or gasoline - whatever you call it, wherever you are - at the pump. This is definitely already basically happening, based on false news coming from the media. Is there actually a shortage of oil coming out of the Middle East right now? No. Did they figure out in the last couple of days that Halliburton cannot blow up ports? Yeah, you know they did. There is also a ship, as I told you earlier in the news, that exploded near Yemen, allegedly by a remote boat that just happened to creep up on a British oil tanker, and no one noticed with enough explosives to nearly split the ship in half. I&#x27;m sorry, I don&#x27;t think so.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">18:31</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I&#x27;m pretty sure that that was actually done remotely on that ship. That would have been from MI-6 or somebody over there in the UK to help with these fake oil shortages. Now, is there any coincidence to this that this accident happened yesterday - on the same day that the Bank of England governor gets on and announces that we&#x27;re going to be in trouble and we&#x27;re going to have an energy crisis like the 1970s and here we go again? No, there&#x27;s no coincidence there. There&#x27;s no coincidences in life. And how did he know that that was going to blow up? And how did he know that the ports were going to blow up? And how did they know that the Middle East would not be able to deliver oil soon? Makes you kind of wonder. Well, you know, these are talking heads for somebody else, aren&#x27;t they? I mean, always.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">19:28</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, speaking of this. So it&#x27;s been a long time now that I have been quote-unquote... My main job has to do with the changes of Earth; with the changes in humans; with alien technology that affects your person - that is harming you, harming Earth, harming humanity, harming the galaxy, and then therefore trickling out with a ripple to every other planet and galaxy elsewhere, because we are a keystone planet. This is the main job. However, you still have to, to some degree, stop these generals from killing us all in the meantime, so that humanity can thrive. And because I&#x27;ve been playing with these guys for a while, I have to try to figure out why they keep doing the same thing; it&#x27;s the same tactic over and over and over again. Now they&#x27;re attacking the ports, guys. No pylon in the ocean is safe! We must protect the pylons. Maybe we should form like a PETA organization. Protect the ports - all port life matters! Or something like that. I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ll have to come up with something good. But ports in the U.S., ports in the Middle East, where are we going now? Rotterdam or someplace else? Who knows?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">21:04</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Anyway, it dawned on me that I&#x27;ve never really discussed - I think I might have touched on it before - about the Law of War. So, these generals - now that we&#x27;re down here, you know, on the global food chain of who controls what - these generals down here have to adhere to, or always had to adhere to, what we call the Law of War. And the Law of War, like I said, specifically states that there are only a few different ways they can create war, and then you can move around the pieces and parts in those selections. So when they want to start a war, everybody is aware that they chose a number 1, you know, maybe biggie-sized it with a side of fries. You know, world wars are created in this way. You can only pick from this kind, this kind, or this kind, and then everybody plays their part.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">22:00</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">What&#x27;s perplexing to them is that I&#x27;m not playing the part. Why am I not delivering them money to pay for this war? Why is money not coming from somewhere else? Who else used to pay for the war? Who else used to pay for the sanctions? Who used to credit the Department of Defense, or GCHQ, or somebody else, when there was a war? When we collected all of those oil fields, we got paid. Why is it that when we&#x27;re collecting oil fields now we&#x27;re not getting paid? How come Halliburton is not paying or getting paid to build yet another port if they blew up the one in Iraq or somewhere else? That&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t adhere to their rules. The GIA does not adhere to their rules. Ground Command does not adhere to their rules. I do not adhere to those rules.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">23:00</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Why? Because number 1, I was never a part of it. This is confusing to them. Why don&#x27;t I just do what I&#x27;m supposed to do, they say? I&#x27;m not supposed to do anything. Those covenants have expired. The War Covenant, it&#x27;s reversed - called Ra - has expired. I don&#x27;t know who handed you those rules, but I can only assume it was my predecessor to keep you in line. Because it was obvious where you&#x27;re going to go. It&#x27;s obvious what you&#x27;re going to do. And hey, by the way, Sun Tzu also got the Art of War. And he wrote it to the T. So that also was written by somebody else. Sorry to say, you know. And pretty much everything they do is exactly the same.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">23:47</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s the Chinese doing it - I get everybody&#x27;s signatures now. I can tell you if it&#x27;s a Chinese general that ordered it; the Pallavicini; the two of them together; because you&#x27;ll see mixtures of, like, a number 7 with a 35 in there. You&#x27;re like, &quot;Oh, okay, that&#x27;s who gave the orders; now we need to hunt those people down.&quot; At the end of the day, still, they cannot take those big black market oil contracts and trade them on the off-ledger - like they used to - and money would come flowing out for allocations against those trade programs, allocations, and quotas. It meets the quota at a highly discounted price for a number of reasons. Number 1, they were supposed to put 10% up - 10% real cash - against those multi-trillion dollar contracts they keep depositing. Okay? Still no 10%? Still no leverage.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">24:59</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Next. The leverage machine is me. I am the leverage machine. So if I don&#x27;t want to fund against a contract - which I&#x27;m not obligated to do, by the way - I have no contract with the Order of the Black Sun, I have no contract with the UN, I have no contract with the World Bank, and I have no contracts with HSBC or any other bank out there to provide any kind of black market, on market, or off market funds. So pretty much at this point, I&#x27;m kind of like a free agent. I can sort of provide funds when I want to, provide funds where I want to, and to whom I want to. And I am not adhering to their rules, if that makes any sense.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">25:40</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">This is where the confusion comes. Where did the money actually come from? Well, you&#x27;re looking at her. And before me, it was an alien that is not here anymore and has gone back to Source, and that is the end of that. That&#x27;s pretty much why there&#x27;s a lot of confusion and misunderstanding amongst the Deep State as to why they just can&#x27;t get whatever they want anymore. Because you were just working for some other people, and those other people aren&#x27;t here. So when they&#x27;re not here and you don&#x27;t work for those people anymore, nobody&#x27;s picking up your alien phone - except for me, on occasion, when I&#x27;m trying to fake you out. You know you&#x27;re just going to keep waiting for the next day ending in Y. These days used to be special, when there was a Lucifer, and there were the 72 General Demons you used to conjure. But nobody comes now, do they? Haven&#x27;t you thought about that for a second? I guess not. But then again, that&#x27;s the Deep State.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">26:40</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So again, I go back to what people do, not what people say. And for you, you probably had a lot of people in your life that say, &quot;I&#x27;m going to do this,&quot; or they say, &quot;I&#x27;ve done that,&quot; or they say, &quot;I think this is going to happen,&quot; or not going to happen, or &quot;I promise you I&#x27;ll be there for you,&quot; and then it turns out they&#x27;re not. And you know this has happened continuously, probably through your life. It has for me anyway; there&#x27;s been a lot of people that have said one thing and done another. So as I got older, I started to learn that I pay more attention to what people do and how people act - and not what people say. Because following through on your word - if you actually give your word - if you give a day, if you give a time, or if you give something - this really means a lot to a lot of people when you actually continuously produce and show up.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">27;45</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, I know people are anxiously waiting for money, and I understand that. I&#x27;m anxiously waiting to give it to you, too. There goes my headphone; sorry about that. But I&#x27;m anxiously waiting to give it to you, too. I feel that we are closer than ever; I&#x27;ve felt that for the last several months. But this is war. This is a real war. This isn&#x27;t a &quot;I&#x27;ll take a number 1 with a side of fries and a milkshake.&quot; This is actual war. And it&#x27;s an ebb and a flow, with you and your enemy, and the energy constantly moves. The enemy here is not necessarily the Deep State - it is in part - but the real enemy here is the AI. So, it&#x27;s a process.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">28:33</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But. To get back to what people do versus what people say. So we told you a few weeks ago that FEMA - there was an article in Forbes magazine - that FEMA went bankrupt. That is true. And it went bankrupt because they&#x27;re consolidating their assets behind the scenes - not FEMA, FEMA&#x27;s owner, which is the Rothschild family - they&#x27;re consolidating their assets behind the scenes and putting them towards other things that they feel are more important, like blowing up poor Islamic people or something like that. So really, there is a very limited FEMA. For those of you that don&#x27;t know, FEMA is an NGO. It&#x27;s not officially a government department. It&#x27;s part of that &quot;Inc.&quot; that everybody talks about. During a natural disaster, or unnatural, depending on which one it is, FEMA would always show up, show some faces on some cameras, dance around with some former presidents like this time, and then go away.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">29:37</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, there&#x27;s a lot of people on social media wondering where the heck is FEMA. FEMA&#x27;s not coming. And we told you FEMA was not coming. I&#x27;m surprised you don&#x27;t know that FEMA is still not coming. The only thing that the government has done at this moment - which is something you should tell your friends and family if you have friends and family in that area - is that the institutions of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae did announce that there could be a reduction or suspension of mortgage payments for those affected by Hurricane Helen.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">30:17</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">This is something you need to know. So if you have someone in that area that has a mortgage - now if you don&#x27;t know, I will tell you. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae basically cover any kind of HUD mortgage. It also covers veterans mortgages and veterans programs; that&#x27;s Ginnie Mae. And Fannie and Freddie basically cover any other bank. So if your loan is with Wells Fargo or Bank of America, you&#x27;re still dealing with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac because these people are the ones that back those mortgages - and used to package them up, and that&#x27;s a story for another day - that&#x27;s how we got into the derivative crisis. But regardless, these people are offering a suspension or possibly a reduction in your mortgage payments if you have been affected by Hurricane Helen.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">31:16</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You can go to www.fanniemae.com, spelled F-A-N-N-I-E-M-A-E, or call 1-855-437-3243. And if Q is correct, that number may only work until October 10th. So you better hurry. I&#x27;m just kidding. I don&#x27;t think anything is going to happen right now; I really don&#x27;t. Because it&#x27;s a source of power for them, and they like that. But in case it does, you might want to make that phone call in the next few days.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So let&#x27;s talk about what we&#x27;re missing, now that FEMA is pretty much kind of on its last legs: land grabbing. Number 1, land grabbing. FEMA was responsible for declaring national disaster areas within the United States. By declaring an area a national disaster area, the land technically, even if it&#x27;s in the interim, belongs to the U.S. Government, or in this case, the &quot;Government, Inc.,&quot; FEMA. The NGO we call FEMA. They would trade against that land - billions and billions of dollars would come out during the time - and allegedly they were supposed to be helping people. Which, several decades ago, they did if there was something that&#x27;s going on. This is just another case of &quot;create the problem and be the solution.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">32:50</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, when they originally, let&#x27;s just say, amplified this hurricane - because it was natural in the beginning - they assumed that they would have lots of money that would just fall out of the natural disaster sky. But that didn&#x27;t work out that way, because my name is not Sky, and it&#x27;s not Alien, and it&#x27;s not anybody else you&#x27;re expecting. And it&#x27;s not Omega or any of those other things, and nothing actually happened. Did anybody bother to call me to find out why nothing happened? No, of course they didn&#x27;t, because they think for some reason I am on the same level as they are.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">33:30</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Which I am not - I am not a Rothschild - I don&#x27;t work for those people; I have never worked for those people; I never intend to work for those people in any way, shape, or form. They are down here [arm lowering] in the food chain, always were. And since about 2012, I am up here [arm raising]. And they are not, not part of what we&#x27;re doing here. They have been given options to participate in the way that they are supposed to. Which means, way back in the day, when we were trying to do balance - and I mean several years ago now - they were supposed to come to the party now, and they were supposed to do their part in the balance game. But that didn&#x27;t work out, and maybe that&#x27;s because God is good. Who knows?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">34:19</div>
<div class="line">But as far as FEMA, good riddance to you. We will not miss you. We do not miss you stealing our properties. We do not miss you stealing all the property on the Gulf Coast or trying to anyway and turn it over to China so you could build casinos and resorts. We do not miss you. So goodbye and good riddance.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">34:41</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Another disaster party that always shows up, or doesn&#x27;t show up these days, is the Red Cross. The Red Cross is known as an international money laundering operation. They can get in and out of anywhere. They look like they&#x27;re helping people. It&#x27;s humanitarian, but everybody knows what they&#x27;re there to do. They&#x27;re there to take money, and then they&#x27;re there to launder money. So they&#x27;ll take your clean money if you&#x27;re donating through the alleged Red Cross to the victims of Hurricane Helena. Hurricane Helene, sorry. Hurricane Helene. I can forget which hurricane we&#x27;re on now. Then, and you are trying to donate to the Red Cross, the answer to the question is don&#x27;t.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">35:27</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">There are a lot of people wondering why the Red Cross commercials are on TV - the ones that actually have power and cable back, or television back - they&#x27;re wondering why they&#x27;re collecting money because on the ground they have no Red Cross at all helping anyone. So you&#x27;d be better off pulling together some doctors in your area and/or nurses and paying them and donating to those people. So if you are in that region and you are a hospital doctor, nurse, whatever it is in the region, and you are helping people for free, then I suggest that you start maybe a GoFundMe page. Let people know where to reach out to you so at least they know that their money is going to help buy supplies for people on the ground, and not the money laundering, international money laundering organizations. So if you want to send donations or send them to churches, there are a lot of churches with a lot of doctors and stuff that are on the ground.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">36:33</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So I just wanted to say good riddance to the laundromats. We don&#x27;t need them. They pretty much take your money, just like the Trump Organization. And I hear the new Christmas ornaments will be out again soon. If you are looking on how to reach out to some of these people, if you are in need of help in the area, a lot of people are using the Nextdoor app. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of inquiries on there. Some people are reaching out into local community Facebook pages, X/Twitter, and other types of social media. And that&#x27;s your best bet.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">37:12</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So again, as I said, I would definitely bet on the people over anyone else. Yep, because I know that they&#x27;re going to show up. They&#x27;ll show up for each other; they&#x27;ll show up for you. Now, not all people, but in this particular case, you did. And I&#x27;m happy to see it. I think no matter what transpires in the next several days coming up, or on or after the 10th of October, or the 10th of October next year, I think you&#x27;ll still continue to show up, and that is why we banked on you. So if we are going to fix this planet, it&#x27;s going to be up to you. It&#x27;s going to be up to all of us. And just like in those communities that were hit by the hurricane, we need to unite. We need to come together. We need to bring our special skills, whatever that is, together with other people and realize that, if a change is going to happen, it&#x27;s going to be up to all of us. And that can be done in a number of different ways. But people together - you can do anything.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">38:23</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">That being said, that pretty much concludes today&#x27;s - Oh, I forgot the most important part. I was going to say concludes, but it doesn&#x27;t. Sorry about that. My notes broke.</div>
<div class="line">The Terraforming. This is kind of exciting for those of you that have been following all the changes that have been going on on Earth. The terraforming process is about 98.6% complete, which means that the hologram has less and less influence. And what you&#x27;re seeing predominantly is more of reality. It was done in such a way that there wouldn&#x27;t be a whole lot of glitching, and you may notice subtle changes once the complete changeover takes place. This is very disturbing and scares the heck out of the Deep State, that knows that that video game was the only thing that ever gave them power - even to some degree, because it didn&#x27;t actually control it in any way - but it could nudge it in certain directions to create problems and issues. This is good for us, because neutering those people that are going around in circles is of the utmost importance, and I&#x27;ve told them so.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">39:43</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Without that, there isn&#x27;t any manipulation of finances, or they can stop oil and gas from flowing, I guess - I don&#x27;t know. But we can then make our own. It&#x27;s amazing what can happen when you&#x27;re dealing directly with the Creator as it relates to nature itself. You can have more influence over nature, just like the sasquatch do. That&#x27;s just another race and another species that inhabits this planet. They have the ability to manipulate nature; so can you. So there&#x27;s a lot of interesting things that are going to come about with the new terraforming of planet Earth, and we will definitely keep you updated.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">40:25</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I&#x27;m hoping - you know, everything is in Source&#x27;s time, so just remember that - I am hoping and praying that over the weekend this will complete. It is looking like that might be the case. I know at the time, I did not disclose this to you because I was concerned about what the Deep State would do. The Lions Gate of 8/8 - we talked about it quite a bit. There was a lot of push and shove with Astaroth and some other beings and things that they created at that time that are no longer with us. But this gate is unusual compared to others in the past, and it will stay open probably into the end of October or beginning of November. Which means that as long as it needs to stay wide open - like it is with that connection to Source - the faster this process is going to happen.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">41:25</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Not to say we haven&#x27;t had interference, mainly from the AIs - anything the Deep State&#x27;s doing is not affecting this process in any way, shape, or form, although they would like to. I am sure they would like to, but it&#x27;s not going to happen. I know that part of the reason why they&#x27;re so focused on this area constantly for war is to create that negative energy and a transmutation of the energy that comes through that gate in Iran right on the border of Iran-Iraq - but that is not happening really anymore; it&#x27;s not working. They were/are trying to open a different gate over in Israel, which is also not working. And still not sure why they&#x27;re continuing - I think they&#x27;re just following orders of people that don&#x27;t really know what else to do. And that has become extremely obvious to us.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">42:22</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I forgot to give you that little bit of an update. That&#x27;s the good part about what&#x27;s happening right now. I mean, there&#x27;s a lot of good things happening, really - two major money laundering operations are being shut down. Spread the word to your friends and family that that money doesn&#x27;t go to the people, and reach out on apps like Nextdoor or other places if you&#x27;re interested in reaching those local people there and helping them out in that way. Or send supplies or buy things that they need. Send cases of water. Whatever it is you want to do, however it is you want to do it, or nothing at all. But if you are wanting to do that, those two organizations are not the place to do it. So reach out to some churches; maybe there&#x27;s a Baptist church and you go to a Baptist church or something in your area. Or whatever organization that you participate in, whichever religion. But it&#x27;d be a good time to do that.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, anyway, that wraps up today&#x27;s World Situation Report. Thank you so much for watching. I know that there&#x27;s been some people that like the new format and some people that don&#x27;t like the new format. And I can understand that. There&#x27;s also been some other rumors that have been going around, like, &quot;Oh, the core team split up.&quot; No, I promise you, Mike is recording this right now. I&#x27;m on the report, and all of the ladies and everybody that we work with and gentlemen are still here and happy and working away.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So nothing has happened in the last several months. If anything, our team is working much better, much more efficiently. As you can see, we managed to come up with a whole new change in just a couple of weeks time. So yeah, a lot of interesting things happening. A lot of new changes. So just bear with us; we&#x27;re getting better and better at all of these, putting all these pieces together. And we&#x27;re looking forward to the New Earth news magazine show coming out - the series. That will be out hopefully in the next, in the coming weeks too.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">44:32</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Definitely looking forward to all these changes. I love doing more news now that I can kind of fit it in. I love being able to talk to you this way, so you can actually see those really strange facial expressions that I often try to hide behind when I&#x27;m not on camera. Meaning everything is written on my face. I am a horrible liar. I should never play poker or any other game that requires you to have a straight face when it&#x27;s just not, when I just don&#x27;t like it. So anyway, that wraps up today&#x27;s World Situation Report for the 4th of October, 2024. And I will see you on Monday.</div>
