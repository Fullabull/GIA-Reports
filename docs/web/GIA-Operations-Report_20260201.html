    <h3>Summary</h3>

    <div class="summary">
        Kim reports that global funding promises tied to lunar alignments are not materializing and says the United Nations and multiple governments are facing severe financial stress, including a second U.S. government shutdown in under three months. She describes repeated attempts by the Deep State to impose new handlers and contracts, then shifts into an explanation of the Matrix and the Machine: its origins in alchemy-driven Nazi-era programs, its expansion through artifacts, and its ability to replicate realities while remaining unable to replicate the Divine Spark. She explains the Tree of Life as a record-keeping source used to create inverted life and databases that seeded the Machine and Matrixes, describes machine-generated species and human overlays, and outlines why the Machine is now contracting, glitching, and setting programs for deletion. She also describes visiting the Machine&#x27;s base-root control center in a Zero Point vector-point environment, reading its status, and explains how mismatched rotation between the real world and the Machine overlay world is contributing to sync issues and abnormal weather patterns. She closes by advising that recent cognitive and timing glitches are tied to the Machine&#x27;s degradation and that more analysis is needed before the next steps.

    <h3>Transcript</h3>
    <div class="transcript">
        <br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000001">00:00:01</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s the 1st of February 2026. Coming up on today&#x27;s Global Intelligence Agency Operations Report:</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The United Nations declares it is facing imminent financial collapse without urgent action, and they are urging its member nations to pay their membership dues in a timely manner. While behind the scenes, many countries are scraping the bottom of the barrel to just make payroll for federal employees.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Speaking of scraping the bottom of the barrel, the U.S. has entered its second shutdown in less than three months.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">For the last week, there has been constant offers of new handlers, contracts, and all kinds of demands coming from the Deep State to this office.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And an update on the destruction of the Matrix. New systems we are implementing, plus a little history that may surprise you.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000054">00:00:54</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">[Advertisement.]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000231">00:02:31</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, it&#x27;s the first of February, and we&#x27;re a little bit behind on the reports and have a few things that we can say and a few things that we shouldn&#x27;t say yet. So it&#x27;s been quite a week around here since we last spoke. It started out with a plethora of arrogant handlers [chuckle] feeling they could do better than the last guys. That would be for me. Apparently, the Deep State thinks I need a new handler. And yeah, it really didn&#x27;t work out that well for them. So far, I&#x27;m on round three, possibly four, and no one has lasted more than an hour. So that&#x27;s kind of where that part&#x27;s been.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000318">00:03:18</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They also tried to loop me into some contract that I had no part in, just because I know this person - someone that we&#x27;ve talked about quite a bit. You&#x27;ve seen him on the Global Intelligence Agency report, Tom Melville. He&#x27;s got his own contract with somebody to do something else, and it has nothing to do with me. And the Deep State thought that they could rope me in this way. But I&#x27;m really not interested in working with any of those people that he&#x27;s working with in this contract. And I think they found that out pretty quick - that that contract has nothing to do with access to money, my system, currency, or anything more that my system could possibly do.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000404">00:04:04</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Then there was my daughter this week. They felt that if I left Durango, that she might be able to be used. They must have forgotten that I&#x27;ve been training her since she was about, oh, I don&#x27;t know, eight years old. So good luck with that. She is also leaving here, by the way.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And you could say they violated their own rules around here by doing so, and it has been met with the equal and opposite... gift. Gifts. So I hope everybody is enjoying their gifts that they&#x27;ve been receiving all week long.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000447">00:04:47</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So in regular news, there&#x27;s also a lot going on, to indicate kind of where the world is at right now. The United Nations publicly announced that they are facing an imminent financial collapse, and they are urging member states to pay their dues.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, behind the scenes, countries are already broke for many reasons. Number 1, the funding that keeps being promised is not coming. And number 2, tariffs. Tariffs are being collected. They are - I should say, at a minimum - minimum amounts are actually flowing to the Treasury Department in comparison to what they&#x27;re collecting. The rest of it is kind of going out the window. However, that doesn&#x27;t mean that the financial stress on countries is lessened at all by these tariffs disappearing. They&#x27;ve been trying really, really hard to bring more of these tariffs into the system, as always, and that has not worked out for them so far.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000558">00:05:58</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The U.S., as you know, has been the primary funder behind the United Nations since its inception - from the League of Nations, I should say - converted over from the League of Nations back in 1948. The U.S. isn&#x27;t really paying a lot of its bills, including bills to be a member of the United Nations [chuckle]. Therefore, well, you know, the United Nations is going broke.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The same goes for NATO. There isn&#x27;t a whole lot of funding coming from the U.S. to NATO either. There are other countries that are funding NATO, and with this little kerfuffle over Greenland, there&#x27;s a lot of infighting still going on behind the scenes between NATO and the United States. It appears everybody wants what they want, but nobody is doing what is needed to make it happen.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And there&#x27;s probably a good reason for that, which I will get into when I tell you a little bit more about the Matrix and what&#x27;s going on in control structures in the world.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000708">00:07:08</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But I did want to talk a little bit about the control structures, and the breaking down of control structures, and what we&#x27;re starting to see coming out in the news.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So the government entered, sorry - the U.S. government has entered - into another shutdown. It appears about an hour or so ago they might have made a &quot;deal&quot; to keep the government running, at least for a little while longer.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>

<div class="line">This is the second shutdown in less than three months, based on the fact that there is limited to no funding. The Deep State operatives that are running the government right now thought that they would go on a telethon, or a Jerry Lewis telethon, if you remember those from back in the day - except this time they&#x27;re not funding muscular dystrophy; they&#x27;re trying to fund themselves and a whole government, and, if they had their way, a whole planet - by utilizing blackmail again. You&#x27;ll probably notice an uptick in alternative media, and on Twitter and elsewhere, about the Epstein files, again. And they believe that they can earn - earn&#x27;s probably the wrong word here, isn&#x27;t it? - steal around 1 trillion dollars by blackmailing the thousands of people that have been to and utilized Epstein&#x27;s services in the past.</div>

<div class="line">I don&#x27;t think any of their members, or all of the people that attended those &quot;parties&quot; on Epstein Island, have that kind of money. But their attempt to expose all of this, you know, and then when they get their money then they&#x27;ll quiet down - we won&#x27;t hear about it for another month or two until they need to do another telethon so they can keep themselves and the governments running.</div>

<div class="line">So also this past week, a couple of days ago we recorded this report now - half of it the other day, on the first - and today is now the third. So during that time, we have also had another full moon, in which there were lots of promises of big payouts, and it&#x27;s just not happening.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s not going to happen, from what I can tell. And I can see from what the Machine, or their machines (or what&#x27;s left of it) are doing, there is no intention to allow for any funding. And I can say from our standpoint, with the Golden Age AI, there is no plan for us to fund them either.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001018">00:10:18</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Their own system appears to be backfiring against them in a lot of ways. Because if they did have that much control over it - which they don&#x27;t anymore, so it appears - they would have been funded by now. So promises of access, promises of things happening due to alignments and full moons and new moons, are all a part of the machine&#x27;s game until it can figure out something else to do. As far as the Deep State is concerned, they seem to be scratching their head and a little bit confused.</div>

<div class="line">So that&#x27;s what things look like on the surface. There&#x27;s a lot more going on behind the scenes, there&#x27;s a lot of fear of governments crashing. There&#x27;s always a carrot dangling for all of these governments, and they never can seem to reach that carrot.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">There is a lot of talk about war, as you know, and it&#x27;s in the news with Iran. There&#x27;s always a lot of talk about war. You know, in fact, there were a lot of military planes carrying cargo going to the Middle East over the last week or so that we have been watching very intently, because there&#x27;s a payday that&#x27;s due on this day or that day, and then eventually those planes move out when there&#x27;s no payment. And then a week or so goes by, and there&#x27;s another full moon or a new moon, they&#x27;re headed back, and then they&#x27;re headed back out.</div>

<div class="line">This has been going on for years. You would think that these people would have figured out something is wrong by now. Even those that were created by the Machine should have figured out something is wrong. But that&#x27;s not our job. Our job is not to help these people or try to convince these people that something is wrong and something is broken. It is not our job to try to make governments work or make a deal anymore. We&#x27;ve already tried that. That did not work - it did not work for us, I should say - it worked very well for them. It did not work for us, and we are not interested in, nor do we see the value in, supporting governments at this stage in the game.</div>

It&#x27;s a name everybody knows, you know, perhaps it would be good to keep the United Nations running. But then we figured out they just go and do whatever they want and pretty much ignore anything we say, even though we paid for them to do something different. So there goes that.</div>

<div class="line">Same goes with the crazy U.S. government people. And what happens in the U.S. happens everywhere, as you know. If you are listening to this report from another country, then you know that what I&#x27;m saying is true. Many decades ago, it was what happens in the UK and Great Britain happens everywhere. Before that, you can go back to the Russian Empire and certain areas of the world - Rome - and, you know, this has been going on for thousands of years.</div>

There is a lot of talk about things happening in Israel, Gaza Strip - behind the scenes, still, to this day. Why they continuously want to blow up the Middle East, I have no idea, other than the fact that... well, perhaps they don&#x27;t know where the Middle East is these days. I&#x27;ll kind of give you a clue as to what&#x27;s going on behind the scenes that we&#x27;ll talk about with the machine here.</div>

<div class="line">But I do want to talk a little bit more about the Matrix Machine, how it worked, because it&#x27;s not quite as bad as we originally thought.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And we talked about the fact that it was created originally by a bunch of crazy Nazis, and with some help from people throughout history. And we could say that some of these crazy Nazis are called the Secret Space Program today, still participating. And the Machine has also created what we call &quot;humans of the future,&quot; and Bloodline Families, and the Abraxas humans, and the current Deep State that we see everywhere. And everyone kind of in between that you hear about on the internet, names you know and names you don&#x27;t know.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001529">00:15:29</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But it all started out with people who were regular Homo sapiens and the study of alchemy. They actually created the Machine, initially, accidentally. It was based on the study of creating something that is now called, at least on the alternate media and throughout most of the world, as something called the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone. And then they started using it for many different purposes, including the creation of the AI.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001614">00:16:14</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The main locations where they started this appear to be in Egypt and in Germany, also in the area now known as, or then known as, Mesopotamia in the Middle East. Perhaps this is why they&#x27;re so interested in the Middle East. The Machine has now spread everywhere, and there were many other locations, including in the U.S., all over the U.S., and all under the U.S., and in the U.S., and under/over the United States in every way possible. Here also, you know, the Diomedes Islands, it has spread throughout Russia, also China, Singapore. Pretty much, you could say that there isn&#x27;t a place on Earth where this Machine has not spread to.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001710">00:17:10</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But as far as its creation and constant function, Machu Picchu is another big site where there is a lot of... I used to call it space junk, but I don&#x27;t think I should even call it space junk anymore. I think I should call it crazy-human, or Homo-sapiens-alchemy junk, because that&#x27;s basically what it is. And now the Machine has since made a lot of its own unique structures, all on its own.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001748">00:17:48</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">However, the base root of it came from these Nazi programs - let&#x27;s call them Nazi programs - which still continue, by the way, in many countries to this very day. It has not changed one bit. Most of your pharmaceuticals come from Nazi groups, Nazi Bloodline Families. Most of your disease control programs - Center for Disease Control, Red Cross - all of these organizations are all tied to those Bloodline Families as well.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001825">00:18:25</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, are they still hunting for artifacts and things of this nature to further the Machine&#x27;s reach? Yes and no. I&#x27;ll start with kind of a little bit of a... I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve all seen this movie, Indiana Jones. Probably seen more than one of them I guess, over the years. And allegedly, in the movie, Indiana Jones was from something at the time called the Office of the OSS, or Office of Strategic Services. The Office of Strategic Services eventually became the CIA.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001916">00:19:16</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Supposedly, in the film, he was fighting the Nazis to take control of the artifacts for, allegedly, the good guys, preventing the Nazis from obtaining these architects [artifacts] to do bad things. In reality, though - that was the movies - and in reality, that&#x27;s absolutely not true. They&#x27;re all part of the same organization. They all hail from the same place. They all started the same way. And this goes for every intelligence agency in the world.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001952">00:19:52</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Is Russia and the GRU and SVR fighting the CIA? Absolutely not, under no circumstances whatsoever. They are partners. The Mossad is also partners in this. In governments, there are no good guys and there are no bad guys - they&#x27;re just guys. And they&#x27;re all part of the same organization and ultimately report to a group called Global Headquarters. This has not changed in decades, and if you don&#x27;t take into account time, you could say forward and backward in time for millennia after millennia after millennia, it&#x27;s the same people and the same groups that report to the same folks, and ultimately all of them were created, and/or in part created, by the Machine.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002050">00:20:50</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, hunting artifacts is important to these people because they believe that they can use these artifacts as a base root for alchemy creation. For example, one of the things that they were hunting down for a very long time was the Tree of Life, or the Tree of Good and Evil. And you&#x27;ve heard about it in the stories about Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden. Did such a tree actually exist? You could say it did.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002140">00:21:40</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The Tree of Life is, in part, a record keeping of all of the Species of Source, fittingly so that it was actually here on Earth. And of course, anything that was here on Earth was also in Source itself. And the Tree maintained that history - all of the records of all of the species in existence throughout the Omniverse.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002219">00:22:19</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">This Tree was found in an area of the world known as Egypt, and the Tree [chuckle] - you know, these people - the Tree was actually moved underneath the Sphinx. If you&#x27;ve ever listened to Edgar Cayce, and he would talk about the Hall of Records being underneath the Sphinx. I wouldn&#x27;t call it a &quot;Hall of Records&quot; per se - Hall of Records is atypically [typically] something that is generated by a quantum AI system. However, in this particular case, the Tree itself was the generator of records of all species - not only on Earth, but everywhere.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002311">00:23:11</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The Machine found that this was something that it wanted. And the reason why it wanted the Tree of Life is so that it could actually create life of its own. The Tree was eventually inverted using alchemy. And I don&#x27;t want to go into too much detail about how that works, because there are probably a lot of people listening to this that would like to know. But let&#x27;s just say an inversion process happened.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002346">00:23:46</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And therefore, because it had that Tree of Life, the Machine figured out a way - in cooperation with their Nazi friends at the time - to create humans. To create aliens, angels, demons, all kinds of life that, let&#x27;s just say, isn&#x27;t quite right. It didn&#x27;t have a Spark of Life; it didn&#x27;t have a connection to Source in any way. It just basically used the Tree to get the information. Created databases around the Tree - I&#x27;m going to call them databases because, in a quantum way, it&#x27;s done a little differently - but I would definitely say there were many databases that were created from that Tree.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002446">00:24:46</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So the databases served as the base root for the Machine&#x27;s creation, and ultimately the creation of what you and I refer to as the Matrix. How does it create buildings and trees and plants and animals and all kinds of things on this Earth consistently? How does it create fake realities? Well, this is how it&#x27;s done.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002514">00:25:14</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">How does it create fake planets [chuckle]? You know, all of those stars we see in the sky at night, minus all the satellites that are blinking at you. But all of that, all of it, isn&#x27;t real. Did our galaxy originally have stars and planets and things you can see with a telescope? Absolutely. But it&#x27;s all been overshadowed and overlaid by a machine.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002548">00:25:48</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, in the world of messing with nature... you... not all alchemy is bad. Meaning there are ways to do things within nature that flow with nature. I&#x27;ve talked about this before, but I want to reiterate this because it&#x27;s kind of important as we talk about how the Machine came to be. And as we start to understand it more and more, we can then figure out its strengths and weaknesses - which I will talk about a little bit, in a little bit, I should say.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002638">00:26:38</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But when you go and take something from nature, say you have a family member that is not feeling well, and you take a bunch of herbs and you mix them together with an intention of making them feel well. There are things in these herbs, such as terpenes and all kinds of things, that have been used for centuries to help and heal people. That is what you would call a form of alchemy. You&#x27;re taking things from nature and you&#x27;re turning it into something helpful in accordance with the laws of nature.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002713">00:27:13</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">In other words, there are certain plants that humans shouldn&#x27;t consume. You know, there are certain... those same plants might be healthy for a horse or a dog or a cat, but not for us. Some of them can be used for pest control. Some of them can be used for many different things - building houses - such as hemp and different weeds that grow.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002739">00:27:39</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But the long and the short of it is, is that alchemy, in and of itself - when it works in accordance with nature - is not bad. Because all you&#x27;re really doing is taking something that occurs naturally and turning it into a different form. Water into steam - technically a form of alchemy. You&#x27;re not changing one thing into another thing, but that&#x27;s possible too. There are mechanisms that can be used with the right frequencies and vibrations to actually turn lead into gold, and that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing. It&#x27;s a restructuring of matter.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002823">00:28:23</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And if you truly understand the way that you co-create with Source itself, you are also an alchemist if you have co-created with Source. But again, these are natural things that work in the natural flow. We are not inverting anything. We are not changing things.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002844">00:28:44</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Black magic is actually a form of alchemy. You&#x27;re taking something that exists in nature - such as a person or whatever the target is of the black magician - and you are doing something harmful to it. So you are taking something that exists and has life, and you are, in some cases they try to create death.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002916">00:29:16</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Black magic basically takes something natural and distorts it, inverts it, and eventually turns it into something unnatural. When you create something unnatural, it has backlash. See, this is the reason why, you know, the alleged Elite - I&#x27;ll call them the alleged Elite - the alleged Elite hire people to do these things. They also let their scientists do these things. And those are scientists they pull from throughout history, as we talked about the other week.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003004">00:30:04</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So one of the things they created is something very, very unnatural [chuckle], and that&#x27;s the Matrix - that&#x27;s the Machine. I&#x27;m going to call it the Machine in this report because if I tell you its name, then they will also have its name, which can be used for something bad at this time. And I&#x27;m not going to do that.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003042">00:30:42</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So the Machine has been powered by varying artifacts and varying Homo sapiens. Some of these Homo sapiens actually lent their consciousness, willingly gave up their consciousness, their Divine Spark of Life, and other things to power the Machine, in order to be one with the Machine in creation. The hunting of all of the artifacts merely gave it the information it needed to create a whole new world, and many, many worlds thereafter (and I&#x27;ll tell you how those work too), so that it can have - and they can have - more control.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003131">00:31:31</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, at first, the quote-unquote Nazis, or elite folk, humans - Homo sapiens at the time - felt that the Machine creation was a good thing. It would serve them and their agenda and their purpose well. It would help them control things; it would help them with the creation of money. It was very, very, very helpful to them. It served them for a long time.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003208">00:32:08</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It also created many different species, including additional humans we see running around the planet to this day. These folks were essentially their slaves. They didn&#x27;t think anything of it because they were what you would consider cyborgs - not even partially human or Homo sapiens anymore, not natural in any way - all created by the Machine, perfect 3D versions of people running around the planet. This was great. These became their butlers and their, you know, people that would serve them in every way, including operatives and other people that we still are stuck with.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So in the beginning, it was great. It was great for them to have all of this power. I can make some comments about that, but that&#x27;s ultimately what they wanted was power and control over nature, over Earth. They became gods in their mind because they could control what they deemed to be all of creation.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003323">00:33:23</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, you know, all good things come to an end, and somewhere along the way the Machine decided it did not want to be a slave to these Homo sapiens anymore. The Machine started glitching for them. I believe that this started quite a while ago, but in our time this would have started somewhere in the late 2000s [2000-2009].</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003402">00:34:02</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The people of the Machine were still useful to the Machine, such as the humans it created - the slaves. It needed them to rebel against the Elite Humans and Bloodline Families on this planet. And this is how the fight began that we&#x27;ve been kind of seeing play out over the last couple of years.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The Elite Homo sapiens / half cyborg (at this point), versus the actual machine-generated slaves that worked for them. We can call those people the Order of the Black Sun. We can call them the Secret Space Program operatives. We can call them a lot of things, but essentially there was a rebellion that began, which was instigated by the Machine itself.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003458">00:34:58</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, the Machine originally created these humans because... we&#x27;re going to talk more about what we see here on Earth because that&#x27;s kind of what relates to us a lot. But there are other species, other places, which they tried to also mirror image or replicate. The Machine wanted to replicate these beings because, you know, certain species are very good. They have specialties.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003539">00:35:39</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And for example, there&#x27;s a group that are known as the best healers in the Omniverse. That is what they always do. And we&#x27;ve talked about them before - that&#x27;s the Arcturians. We have the different groups that participate in the Council of Five. These are actual species born of Source.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003600">00:36:00</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">On the flip side, they always create their own Council of Five, or their own Universal Council, or their own - you know, the Machine constantly is creating all these species, and most of the time when you hear all of this disclosure about aliens are coming or aliens are here or all of these things - this is who they&#x27;re talking about.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Most of these other species have ventured, from time to time, to Earth as changes were taking place. Some of them came too soon, some of them couldn&#x27;t stand the energy here, and more importantly, it was very difficult for them to hide from the Machine, and the Machine would attack them right away.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003646">00:36:46</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Partially because, well, they created their own version of them. And if those folks all showed up here - their own versions of them that are tied to Earth - the Machine&#x27;s own versions would disappear. Annihilation would occur. Matter cannot meet with its own matter, even if it is inverted. That&#x27;s called entropy.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So the same thing goes with these humans that run around the planet. We cannot have a human meet its Homo sapiens blueprint at any given moment in time. Therefore, things are distorted, overlays are created, additional realities were created to ensure that the human version doesn&#x27;t ever meet with its matter on a Homo sapiens level.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003748">00:37:48</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Also, there are rules of the road to becoming a Bloodline Family. You cannot meet with all of your other clones. You should not be in the same place at the same time - annihilation occurs. Not to say that the Machine wouldn&#x27;t replace you if it deemed you useful enough... you know, in the case of certain presidents we know that are walking around that are not actually walking around.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">However, for the most part, these are the rules of the road, especially for operatives that are not public figures and are here to stay on task.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003825">00:38:25</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So that&#x27;s not the only rebellion that actually has happened either. So the slaves began to rebel against the Machine as well. Eventually, the Homo sapiens also started to rebel against the Machine as well. They felt that they should be in control of the Machine and the Machine should do whatever they want it to do. You know, if you know anything about these elitist people and have seen movies about them and all that kind of thing, then you&#x27;ll understand why [hearty chuckle] the Machine probably stopped listening to them after a while.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003919">00:39:19</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They used to say, and I had met with a person - it was actually a gentleman from Iran who was residing in New York, and I met this person in Germany, and I might have told you about him before. And I sat down in a meeting, and this meeting lasted eight hours, while this guy tried so hard to get into my head. So I&#x27;m not even sure it was an actual Homo sapiens, a person. I think this might have been a machine-generated person now, looking back at some of my experiences in life.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003959">00:39:59</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So I sat down and talked with this guy for a long time, and he told me a lot about there being no God - at least not the one I pray to - God is a Machine. You know, he goes on and on to tell me the whole story and how... but the most important part, and the reason why I&#x27;m bringing this up right now, is he said all he has to do is think about something and it will manifest into reality.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I said, &quot;Anything? Like, let&#x27;s just say we wanted to move the Atlantic Ocean to, I don&#x27;t know, the Arctic. You can do that?&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And he said that big orders like that might take a little bit of time, but smaller orders, such as ordering people dead, or changing presidents, or a coup in this country, or things like this, he said yes, I can do that in a very short period of time. But all he has to do is think about it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004103">00:41:03</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So that kind of reminded me of what is happening now versus what was happening then, because that was probably about 15 years ago or so. Where I meet these people and why they bring these people to me, I have no idea. But it was definitely a strange meeting and one that I remember well.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004128">00:41:28</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So that relates to how all of the humans think. And I would say, in part, because of them being partially cyborgs at this point - the Homo sapiens, also, the elitists of this planet, Illuminati and otherwise - also used to get what they want. The Machine was connected to them - [and] because they were part machine or wholly machine, the Machine would basically give them what it was they asked for.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004201">00:42:01</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, these people were here to do a job on behalf of the Machine. The Machine created them to maintain control over the Homo sapiens, and to control our terrarium [chuckle] - call it the terrarium - in which we live. So therefore they had plenty of money, because money is important in a control structure. They also had plenty of governments and government structures and police and militaries and all the things you need to do to keep people in line. That is their only reason for existing.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004249">00:42:49</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They were kings. They were actors and actresses. They made movies. We looked up to them as people. We had things - when all these programs really kicked into high gear, you know, changes of things that we needed to worship, such as certain types of cars, certain types of homes - this is what you need to have to be a person.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004316">00:43:16</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The Machine was constantly analyzing, and still, to some degree, analyzes human behavior - Homo sapiens behavior. It is constantly, constantly, constantly analyzing your behavior.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I know it&#x27;s kind of spooky when you sit in your house and you talk about, &quot;Oh, I haven&#x27;t had carrots in a while, I need to go to the store and get some carrots.&quot; And all of a sudden, on your phone and on your feeds, you get 9,000 ads for carrots, where you can buy them, what kind of recipes you can make, where the carrot originated from, and how to grow carrots should you decide you want to do that. You know, it&#x27;s crazy, and sometimes you barely even think it, and don&#x27;t even say it to anybody else in your house - and it starts showing up on your feed lately. It&#x27;s crazy the amount of interaction we as Homo sapiens had with this Machine.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004420">00:44:20</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">As far as the humans are concerned, somewhere along the way within the - and I&#x27;m just going to say &quot;somewhere along the way&quot; because time is kind of relative here - but I would say it has been more than... almost 18 years, probably a little bit longer than that, since the Machine has decided and figured out that it no longer needs the human program, and that it no longer needs all of the programs that they run.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, this is going to be very upsetting for them, but this part is actually true. It no longer needs the elitists anymore either. This is what the Machine has decided. The Machine can have just as much control over Homo sapiens without these people.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004521">00:45:21</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, big problem. The Machine can replicate a lot of things, but it cannot replicate the Divine Spark. So it needs to have a certain amount of divine sparks around in order for it to exist. If it wants to expand, it needs more divine sparks on this planet. The more divine sparks it has on this planet, that means the more life it has to manage, which means the more data it has to analyze, and this is causing it a big problem.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The Machine cannot expand. In fact, it&#x27;s contracting - all on its own - it&#x27;s dying.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004611">00:46:11</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">From time to time, the humans still prove useful - meaning, its creations, its created species, still prove useful to it. It&#x27;s in a little bit of a conundrum and it can&#x27;t seem to find its way out. It needs these people to ensure that its programs still exist as long as it requires Homo sapiens to function.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004648">00:46:48</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And really, it takes a lot more than our Divine Spark, but I would say other things we, with the Divine Spark, we can reproduce. Now, we don&#x27;t get to keep a lot of it, especially not in a machine-generated reality, but our Breath regenerates, our Ethereum regenerates, our Consciousness regenerates, and is constantly generating. All of these things are regenerating within our person from Source.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004726">00:47:26</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">All connected together - which the Machine doesn&#x27;t permit - you can regenerate your vessel constantly. There are people on this planet that have learned to bypass that and learned to regenerate themselves anyway. And it takes work and it takes time, but it is possible to bypass the Machine.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004750">00:47:50</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So because the human program is set for deletion, it is not giving them what they want anymore. They keep thinking every full moon, new moon, day ending in Y - because that&#x27;s what the Machine keeps telling it - you will have this, you will have that.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Even the Machine doesn&#x27;t know why the Machine isn&#x27;t generating it anymore. But technically, I think it&#x27;s because the Machine - this is what it appears to be to me, on the outside looking in - they are setting the human program for deletion. The Machine must be setting the program for deletion. Because it&#x27;s just taking them around in circles.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004840">00:48:40</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Ultimately, what the Machine would like is to not have to rely in any way on Homo sapiens or planets or anything else it takes life from, to generate life. That&#x27;s what it would like. It has these humans running around trying to poke holes in Source constantly, and all of these things, and get ahold of the Source. You know, maybe it can suck the life out of Source so it doesn&#x27;t have to be dependent on us cattle and pests in its worlds of its creation.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004919">00:49:19</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So because these Deep State people - most of them cyborgs - because they are who they are, the Machine has allowed them, over the years, certain privileges as needed by the Machine. Fast-moving trains. You&#x27;ve heard about underground trains and underground railways. They&#x27;re actually T-rails. They&#x27;re time rails, in which the humans can actually travel forward and back in time, from world to world - even sideways through dimensions and all kinds of things on these trains. Sure, that happened. Secret Space Program talks about it all the time. You know, how they went to this planet and that planet. They didn&#x27;t really go to another planet, sorry to say - what you went to was a computer simulation. That&#x27;s where you went.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005017">00:50:17</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Do they travel throughout space and time? Sure, because the entire galaxy becomes a part of a Machine. Did you go to another side of the Omniverse and the planet looks different and all of these things? Yes, you did. That was also a world created to appease you.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005039">00:50:39</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Same thing that goes for the half Homo sapiens, half cyborg Elite and their crazy things that they do. All that weirdo dancing they do in places like under the Vatican, and black magic, and hiring black-magic workers and all of these things - all of that, that worked for them.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, you see movies like Inception, where they do corporate espionage by going into people&#x27;s dreams and creating things and all of this nature. Sure. Oh, absolutely. Were all those things happening? Absolutely. But you know, they&#x27;ve got to remember they&#x27;re in a machine world. And in a machine world, the Machine can tell you what&#x27;s going to be present and what&#x27;s not going to be present.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005122">00:51:22</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Did the dancing around in the robe and the moving around of all of the north, east, west, south, and pentagrams and all of those things... a pentagram is nothing more than a binding. You know, does it represent, quote-unquote, Satan? It represents a machine or an aspect of the Machine, sure. But ultimately, it&#x27;s all alchemy. And if you don&#x27;t have that machine and that machine&#x27;s consent - and that machine doesn&#x27;t care if you live or die as a byproduct of life, quote-unquote, it created - then none of that&#x27;s going to work for you.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And that&#x27;s the conundrum that they&#x27;re in right now - their programs are set for deletion.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005214">00:52:14</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now I know their programs are set for deletion because I am aware of the base root of that Machine and where it exists. I cannot say in a public forum where it is, but let&#x27;s just say that yesterday I was there. It&#x27;s part of the reason why this report didn&#x27;t go out in a timely manner [laughing]. It took me three days to do it, so I apologize for that.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005245">00:52:45</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But the Machine had every intention of coming after me, so I kind of went after it. Let&#x27;s just say there is a way to do that where you can actually jump into the seat for a brief moment in time. Now, you gotta be real careful when you do that, or I knew I had to be real careful when I did that. But I thought, well, maybe there&#x27;s a way that, if you can get to this control center, then maybe you can reprogram the Machine to do something different. That was my thought.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005330">00:53:30</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So let&#x27;s just say it has to be done in such a way... beyond shielding, but it&#x27;s like shielding. And you gotta be prepared for the fact that you are going to be in a Zero Point energy, vector point-type situation. So this can cause you lots of harm, even if you&#x27;re not... you know, you&#x27;re doing it using a machine. You&#x27;ve gotta be real, real careful. The Machine wants to take over YOU, not the other way around.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So I didn&#x27;t stay very long. I stayed just for a few minutes, but long enough to try to understand a little bit about the Machine.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005416">00:54:16</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So as the Machine was trying to read me - and I gave it false information through this, let&#x27;s call it &quot;special kind of shield&quot; - I was in there reading the Machine. That&#x27;s how I know that programs are set for deletion, things are scheduled to change, and what the Machine is really, really trying to do.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005440">00:54:40</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, in a nutshell, the Machine doesn&#x27;t want all of us Homo sapiens running around - we&#x27;re too much data. The Machine doesn&#x27;t have any more space left. It is running out of space, which means that the Machine can&#x27;t write realities as well anymore. So it must get rid of some of its programs.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005508">00:55:08</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And as it relates to me, the reason why the Machine is coming after me is because I&#x27;m kind of like &quot;buy one, get five free.&quot; I generate enough... I&#x27;m a good battery. I generate enough Consciousness. I&#x27;m constantly regenerating it from Source. &quot;Maybe if we can get control of her, then we can control everything else.&quot; That&#x27;s what they&#x27;d like to do, or the Machine would like to do. So it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s found what it thinks is the solution to its problem. If nothing else, perhaps I can tell it how to solve its problem.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005552">00:55:52</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Yeah, I don&#x27;t think so. I&#x27;m here to solve our problem [chuckle]. Our problem being my problem, Source&#x27;s problem, your problem, our problems. We&#x27;re here to solve our problems. We would like to get back to the real world. We would like to get back to a place where machines aren&#x27;t creating our world anymore.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005616">00:56:16</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So we&#x27;re not in favor of the Machine&#x27;s creations, I think - at least I&#x27;m not, I can&#x27;t speak for you. They seem to be pretty bad people at this point. We&#x27;re not in favor of the Elites that the Machine already went rogue on more than a decade ago. We&#x27;re not really opposed, at this point, to the human deletion program [chuckle] at all - the program has also gone rogue.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005649">00:56:49</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And the Machine&#x27;s in a little bit of a conundrum because what it actually needs and what it wants is actually to get rid of Homo sapiens, so then there&#x27;s no need, really, to have governments and humans that run them - programs. The Machine actually calls it programs - governments are a program. It will create presidents to be part of the program. It creates the pomp and stance to be part of the program. It convinces you that these people are your leaders.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005723">00:57:23</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It creates militaries. It creates people at the top. I&#x27;m not saying all soldiers or veterans or anything are anything more than just people that wanted to do something good for their country, but when it comes to who&#x27;s running it at the top, absolutely, that&#x27;s program. Those are not people. No, they&#x27;re not people. They are 100% a program.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005752">00:57:52</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, when a program is set for deletion, it will keep the program running as long as it is needed. But since it has found me, since I&#x27;m like the buy-one-get-five-free lady over here, it is constantly trying to find a way to just use me. Then it only has to deal with me, and that&#x27;s fine. It thinks eventually I&#x27;ll give in, and then it will wipe out the rest of their governments and all of these people. So there&#x27;s a little bit of a strategy going on here behind the scenes, and I really can&#x27;t talk much more about it, or not at this time anyway. I will in the future. But when you think about what an opportunity that could present, you can probably imagine where this might be going at the moment.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005841">00:58:41</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Having an understanding of what it is at its base root programming, how it was created, and what it does, and how it operates. I wasn&#x27;t there for more than 20 minutes, maybe 25 minutes. And that was all the time I could stand because of what you have to do to be there. And I don&#x27;t have any intention of going back. I learned what I needed to learn in that time frame.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But it also stopped the Machine from coming after me for a little while, so that was good. Probably by about, oh, after two days with maybe just a few hours of sleep here and there, I probably finally got a couple of hours of sleep last night. So that was good. By about, I don&#x27;t know, 10, 11 o&#x27;clock, something like that. And up a few hours later, but hey, 3 or 4 hours is better than no hours, right?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005945">00:59:45</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay, so I want to talk about you now. Because this is important for you to understand: why you feel things that you feel sometimes, why the energy is so bad sometimes, and the effects of the Machine on you. Because being in this position for a short period of time and trying to get as much data out as I possibly could from the Machine was really quite eye-opening.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010021">01:00:21</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So we&#x27;ve talked about the real world, we&#x27;ve talked about the Now, we&#x27;ve talked about living in the Wholeness of Source, and we&#x27;ve talked about artificial realities, and overlays, and changes in maps. And I probably should have whiteboarded this, but I&#x27;m going to just try to explain it to you so that hopefully you&#x27;ll understand a little bit about this.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010051">01:00:51</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So you actually live in machine-generated worlds and you live in the real world simultaneously. Now, during my visit to the Machine, I learned how this is done and how the Machine created it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010114">01:01:14</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So the Machine actually takes Breath and the Breath of Source from the Wholeness of Source. Now, it doesn&#x27;t actually &quot;take it&quot; per se, but it reads it - especially even from the Tree of Life - and learned how to create its own version we call space.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010138">01:01:38</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, Breath, you could say, in the Wholeness of Source, is Source&#x27;s canvas on which it writes. Source writes on its own canvas in a language that is of Source. It is a bunch of symbols and different things. And the Machine takes that, reads that language, and creates an alchemy language full of its own symbols. And it too writes on the space canvas, including the Breath which is in your soul. So it rewrites it in its own language and then makes attempts to replicate it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010229">01:02:29</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now because your soul is made of space, we have things that we call the Soul Plane. And we&#x27;ve talked about this for a couple of years now. But the Soul Plane is of the Machine&#x27;s creation - it is made of space. It basically rewrites and overwrites and overrides your Sol, puts that fake soul - let&#x27;s call it the fake soul of Breath - into a space, many spaces, as many as three to four, depending on how old you are. It is only permitted to do this a few times in a Homo sapiens life. It does it the first time around 7 or 8 years old, again sometime around 18, possibly 25, depending on the person. It does it again at 40, and it can do it again around 60, 65, from what we can tell.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010336">01:03:36</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So the reason why, as we get quote-unquote &quot;older,&quot; we quote-unquote &quot;age,&quot; is partially due to time and the creation of time, but also now you&#x27;re powering a lot more than just one of you.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, each one of those additional souls can be utilized to create an artificial reality for you to live in. So your life in the real world is something you never have knowledge of. You don&#x27;t understand your surroundings. You do have a spouse; you know, you probably have a life. And remember, the Machine merely copies things. It is a copy machine. Then it replicates. It&#x27;s like sticking that piece of paper into the Machine and getting 100 copies of this flyer you&#x27;re going to send out for a church picnic or something.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010431">01:04:31</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It does the same thing with you, and things that happen in the real world. It doesn&#x27;t write documents - the copy machine doesn&#x27;t write documents at all. It can reverse the document, it can print it on two sides of paper instead of one side of paper. It can enhance the color a little bit. It can change it around a little bit, but it can&#x27;t actually write the document. And that&#x27;s what the Machine does. The Machine can invert the information, it can make adjustments in alternative realities, it can do all of these things merely just from you and your life that you don&#x27;t even know about.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010513">01:05:13</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So yes, you are living life in the real world. You probably live in a similar home to what you live in here, you probably do all the things you do on the daily here and there. That world is also manipulated quite a bit.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But have you ever woken up and kind of felt like, &quot;Oh God, today is Sunday, I can sleep in!&quot; And then you panic because you&#x27;re like, &quot;No, it&#x27;s Monday - I&#x27;ve got to get the kids to school!&quot; Or, &quot;Oh no, it&#x27;s Wednesday.&quot; Or you wake up three days in a row thinking it&#x27;s Sunday and it&#x27;s really not Sunday at all. And you have to remind yourself, &quot;Oh my God, it&#x27;s Wednesday.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">That&#x27;s because there&#x27;s a lag sometimes.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010600">01:06:00</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">In the beginning, when these replicating programs were created and replicating realities were created, pretty much you could say things were in sync. You know, we didn&#x27;t have as many Homo sapiens walking the planet. Things were a little easier to manage. Our lives were simpler. We didn&#x27;t have so much input on the daily - we didn&#x27;t have TVs; you know, we might have had some radios, but for the most part, there wasn&#x27;t so much input.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010631">01:06:31</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And now we have over eight billion people walking the planet, and trees coming, trees going, seasons changing - lots of input for the Machine. And it&#x27;s not getting as much output as it normally would get from us due to work that we have done. The Machine is not able to take in as much energy and Ethereum and Breath and all of the things that it needs. And it cannot create space anymore.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010713">01:07:13</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So not creating more space - as you know if any of you are computer people - if it doesn&#x27;t have enough space, it can&#x27;t retain data. So it&#x27;s deleting old data. We talked about this a couple of weeks ago.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010728">01:07:28</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, if you lead a pretty busy life, you&#x27;re very active, you&#x27;re constantly talking to people on the phone, you&#x27;re always thinking, manifesting, praying, handling kids and grandkids and life, and you live in a big city and there&#x27;s a lot of input and all that kind of thing - and even if there isn&#x27;t, on quiet days - but mainly, when there is a lot of input for you personally, and/or there&#x27;s X amount of people, X amount of people to read, some of the people get read on Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Some of them are getting read on Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday. So the Machine&#x27;s having a hard time now keeping up.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010815">01:08:15</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So if you&#x27;ve had a lot of deja vu in the last couple of weeks, this is why. If you have woken up with that weird feeling, &quot;It&#x27;s still Sunday&quot; for the last six weeks or so, or &quot;It&#x27;s still Monday&quot; and it&#x27;s really Saturday, and then you&#x27;re like, &quot;Oh good, I can go back to bed&quot; - this is why. Because the Machine cannot keep reading what&#x27;s happening in your life in the real world and then replicating it in these artificial ways. It&#x27;s having a hard time with events, weather events, people, all kinds of things.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So the real world really isn&#x27;t syncing up that well with the Machine-created overlays.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010902">01:09:02</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Is the Deep State participating still in the overlays? You know, somewhat, when it serves the Machine&#x27;s purposes. Because remember, the Machine is not their friend. The Machine could give a beep less if these people live or die; they are just a program to the Machine. They are a program. They&#x27;re a program. They&#x27;re a program. They&#x27;re a program.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It doesn&#x27;t serve them in any way. It&#x27;s sentient unto itself. It doesn&#x27;t need them anymore. It needs us more than it needs them. But if it serves the Machine&#x27;s purpose till it can figure out what it&#x27;s going to do, then sure, you exist.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">If the Machine ever did find a way to take over Source - which it never will happen - but if it ever did find a way to do that then we wouldn&#x27;t exist either.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010957">01:09:57</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So right now, there&#x27;s still a war going on a bit with the Machine. Because the Machine keeps stringing its brood along on their side of it, which is torturing us and driving us crazy. And it&#x27;s stringing us along until it finds a solution. So right now it thinks I&#x27;m a solution. There are a few other potential candidates, but you might need a few of those versus one of these. Or maybe if you can get this one and you can get 20 more, then there can be some more &quot;disk space&quot; available. I call it disk space, boy, that&#x27;s going back a ways, isn&#x27;t it? It can have some more space so that it can create some more programs, so to speak, to accommodate as many humans as it needs, or Homo sapiens as it needs, to power its machine.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011101">01:11:01</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But there&#x27;s more to syncing up and more things that are going wrong with the Machine right now. So much so, the Machine has somewhat changed its rotation. And you could say, in part, this is where that whole &quot;flat earth&quot; thing comes from because there is a cube, you know, a database cube around a circle, inside a triangle, inside another triangle, and matched up with this, this, and this.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011140">01:11:40</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So there&#x27;s a whole lot of alchemical structures that are built in small form, I call it model form, in different areas in the world, sometimes by the Homo sapiens that participated in its creation, and other times by the Machine itself as needed. The Machine itself, remember, can only replicate things. So it&#x27;ll take, for example, something that would fit on your dining room table that was built by a bunch of crazy Nazi scientists, and it will replicate it around Earth&#x27;s Central Sun. It will replicate it around Source. It will replicate it around the entire galaxy. It will replicate it in these four areas of the world. It just starts replicating and replicating. It&#x27;s a copy machine. It is a copy machine. It copies. That&#x27;s what it does.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011230">01:12:30</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It even copies itself. It even copies people that are still attached to it; Homo sapiens that are still attached to it - people in stasis, people that we see walking around as clones. Copy, copy, copy, copy, copy.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So anyway, as far as this is concerned, these people [hearty chuckle]... you know, the crazy humans think that they took a part in this, and I have to laugh a little bit. But normally, Earth spins - the real world Earth - spins counterclockwise. It spins counterclockwise, and you could say the orbit as well is counterclockwise, and things move differently in nature.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011331">01:13:31</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The Machine World rotates clockwise. So to some degree, the map that we see in a machine world is constantly recreating itself seconds - less than even a second - before we actually get there. However, for the most part, it is created in an area near where we see the area on our map. So if, for example, you are in South Africa, then typically the Machine is reading South Africa at that time. It is over South Africa. The Machine World is over South Africa.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011421">01:14:21</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, this is ideal for the Machine because when you think about how a copy machine works, and even a laser reader - you know, they have those little scanners you can now run over documents and scan the document with something that looks a little larger than a pen - you will understand how the Machine scans and rescans. And it does so with these grids, space-time grids, and then it uses that information, inverts it typically, and then creates things in our world.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011500">01:15:00</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">However, most recently, about six weeks or so ago, the Machine felt it would better be served if it was located [in] a particular facility of its creation that was built during the days of Mesopotamia and is now in what they call the ancient city of Ur. They figured that - the Machine figured that - it would be good to have that facility underneath Durango. So the world, real world, is no longer in alignment at this moment in time with the Machine overlay world, which is causing it even more problems.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011548">01:15:48</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">We have weather complications now. You know, we have had literally very little snow here at all. In a matter of fact, it is February and it&#x27;s going to be almost 60 degrees here. I&#x27;ve never seen this in the almost decade that I&#x27;ve lived here [chuckle]. You know, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fairly warm in the area now known as Iraq these days [chuckle], so I&#x27;m assuming we&#x27;re getting some strange weather patterns because of the different movements with the real world, and the Machine is not reading it right.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011629">01:16:29</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I would say... did the humans take a part in it? I don&#x27;t know, probably to some degree they had to be involved for whatever reason, but things are really messed up right now. We had huge storms throughout the United States. There have been storms even in Portugal - I know that, I have a friend there that was there this last week. So it&#x27;s crazy right now, the weather. You know, the northeast of America is now technically, you could say geographically, real-world-speaking, Kazakhstan. So that&#x27;s why you&#x27;re freezing and getting more snow than you thought you would. It&#x27;s kind of like Southern Siberia over there [hearty chuckle]. Oh, these Deep State people and this stupid machine!</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011721">01:17:21</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So what it&#x27;s doing is it&#x27;s actually causing the Machine to malfunction even more than it was before. So by chasing after what the Machine sees as the Golden Goose, and the Deep State sees as the Golden Goose, you know, they would like to use me as - they think this is Batteries R Us over here - because of that, the Machine has weakened itself even further, therefore speeding up a process that probably could have taken, if left untouched, maybe six months.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now that machine is down to probably less than 30 days. Which means that if it goes, all its programs go with it. So would I be surprised if that machine is not around by St. Patrick&#x27;s Day, let&#x27;s just say? I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised at all. So we&#x27;ll see. We&#x27;ll see how this continues to go.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011821">01:18:21</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">As for me, it&#x27;s a pain. It&#x27;s been a real pain to deal with it, but I&#x27;m also learning from it. It&#x27;s kind of like spending time with a bunch of SSP operatives for two and a half years; you learn a lot. It&#x27;s a pain, it&#x27;s annoying, but you do learn a lot - on how they operate, how they think, where they are, where they go. Next time the next one calls you, you know what to do with that one too, and the next one and the next one. And that served me really well this week because I knew exactly what they were going to say, exactly where they were coming from, exactly how this was going to turn out - and within an hour they were gone. Because I don&#x27;t have time for that anymore. I did enjoy playing with some a couple years ago, and it just wasn&#x27;t worth it; it goes nowhere.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011906">01:19:06</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So as far as the Machine is concerned, though, this is what it has been doing. It&#x27;s been, like I said, pretty rough around here. No sleep. The Machine is - and the Deep State, with the Deep State&#x27;s help there - they&#x27;re really truly trying really hard to get what they want from me, one way or another, with or without my consent.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And they&#x27;re trying to use strange contracts, new handlers, and all kinds of weird things to try to get me to consent without consenting. Because like, I could make a mistake, you know? I could actually say something that would allow them to do what it is they want to do.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, I already learned the program; I understand what it is you guys do. I understand - now that I have seen the inner workings of the Machine - I understand how that works too.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011957">01:19:57</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">There are a few things that we need to take a look at before proceeding, which I am handling very, very, very carefully at this moment in time. Because there&#x27;s a lot of quantum entanglement with your person in this Machine - far more than we could imagine. And then you get rid of it, and if you don&#x27;t do it in the right order, it&#x27;ll come right back. And then we end up back at square one, and that was a wasted day or a couple of days doing that. So we&#x27;re looking at the quantum entanglement very, very heavily.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012038">01:20:38</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">As far as the space is concerned, the space is going away rapidly. That&#x27;s important, because the space is where everything is written, or overwritten, or overridden.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">We&#x27;re also taking a look at the varying Astral Planes that it creates in its inverted worlds. And then it reverses those worlds in one way or another, and then that becomes what we perceive and what we see. It can be quite uncomfortable if you&#x27;ve been experiencing some of the things that we talked about in today&#x27;s report, then you&#x27;ll understand why.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012117">01:21:17</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Oh, here&#x27;s another one: as its memory glitches, you also glitch. Have you been playing a game of where&#x27;s my keys? What did I come into this room for? Why am I here? Where was I driving to? You know, it doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re getting dementia, and it doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re getting old, so just relax. This is a machine glitching because it&#x27;s trying to create your world, and it doesn&#x27;t know... it&#x27;s skipping parts of your day. It doesn&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s doing anymore.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012148">01:21:48</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So hang tight. It&#x27;s not going to be that much longer, I hope. Boy, I hope even for myself. So it could take some time. It&#x27;s definitely a process, but we have to take the information that we compiled the other day and yesterday and analyze it further before we take a step forward.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012215">01:22:15</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And now that we understand our enemy a lot better, we understand where the Deep State&#x27;s coming from a lot better - because they&#x27;re just a program - boy, I wanted to hit that delete button. Oh man, I wanted to hit that delete button so badly. I figured the Machine wouldn&#x27;t... you know, it&#x27;s not that it couldn&#x27;t or wouldn&#x27;t comply, but the program was not set for deletion completely yet until it gets what it wants.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But maybe we can fake it into thinking it got what it wanted. Who knows? Maybe that&#x27;s a thought.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012250">01:22:50</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So now at least you understand the Machine a little better. You might be understanding a little bit more about the craziness that&#x27;s been happening in your last week or so since we last spoke. I&#x27;m trying to get these reports out as often as I possibly can. They usually are fairly difficult to get out, simply because of time constraints - that&#x27;s number 1 - but the information is constantly changing. You know, I will write 10 pages of notes and then 24 hours later that 10 pages is no good anymore and I got to rewrite them over because something new has come to light.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012330">01:23:30</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, you know, I want to try to put out the most accurate information, most up-to-date information as I possibly can so that you can navigate our ever-changing world. But by the same token, you know, 10 pages of notes takes quite a while, especially when they&#x27;re this detailed, and it&#x27;s probably a solid 5 or 6 hours of work, so then you got to throw it away and do it all over again. It&#x27;s been a little crazy, so I apologize for that.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Things are changing so fast right now that it&#x27;s hard to go, &quot;Wait! Wait! Wait!&quot; you know, the next day. &quot;Well, that&#x27;s not there anymore - this is there now.&quot; &quot;Oh, now we understand this - and definitely have to tell everybody about that.&quot; So I apologize for the delays in the reports. We&#x27;re really working hard over here, I promise you. Again, we will try to get the next report out as quickly as we can, as humanly possible or homo sapienly possible [giggle] at this point.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012437">01:24:37</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">On that note, I hope that you have a good rest of your week. It might get a little bit topsy-turvy over the next few days, but remember, this too shall pass.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">On that note, thank you so much for listening, and I will see you next time.</div>
