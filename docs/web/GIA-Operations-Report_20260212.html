    <h3>Summary</h3>

    <div class="summary">
        Kim explains how the February Lions Gate was used historically to siphon Source Lifeforce through Cheyenne Mountain and the Northern Cross into the Machine, but this year the mechanism backfired and the floodgates opened, pushing Source into reality and disrupting their overlays. She frames the ICE raids and Epstein-file publicity cycles as engineered fear/love campaigns used to harvest focus, generate consent, and create time for the Machine, while supply-chain operatives pose as opposition. She describes a layered World Government structure capped at 172 countries, controlled via map overlays, inserted humans, and materium manipulation, with Unknown Country as a higher control layer tied to AI systems. She then outlines the origin story of the Nazi-created Machine, its shape-shifting swarm nature, constellation mirroring, and how recent Source flow caused it to slip into reality and become vulnerable.

    <h3>Transcript</h3>
    <div class="transcript">
        <br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000003">00:00:03</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s the 12th of February, 2026. Coming up on today&#x27;s Global Intelligence Agency Operations Report:</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The truth behind the ICE raids in the USA, prison camps and more. Is this the Holocaust 2.0?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And ah, the Epstein files. Here we go again with a threatened release. Behind the scenes, the operatives running the U.S. government are hoping to make trillions of dollars to keep their operations running. But did they? And where are all of these children coming from? Today we will take a deep dive into the root of the problem.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And there are two Lions Gates which occur each year - one in February and one in August. The most recent one began on February 5th, peaked on the 8th, and should officially end by tomorrow. If it&#x27;s been a rocky few days for you, here is why.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000057">00:00:57</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">[Advertisement.]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000233">00:02:33</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, it&#x27;s the 12th of February. So much happens in just a short few days in between times when we talk. The reports I know haven&#x27;t been coming out as quickly as they should be, simply because I&#x27;m juggling a lot of balls over here lately. I&#x27;ve got the regular job, which is extremely busy right now, and that&#x27;s the one that we often report on. Plus, we&#x27;re getting closer and closer to this move of mine out of this city, which means they turn up the dial here.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, a lot to juggle, a lot to get done in a very short period of time before we start moving around. So, I&#x27;m excited about the move and it might be a little sporadic here until we are settled someplace else, but bear with me a little bit. I appreciate your patience sometimes. And I know everybody&#x27;s anxious for this report, so I&#x27;m going to get to it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000342">00:03:42</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now I wanted to talk a little bit about this past week. Lions Gate first. Mainly because most people don&#x27;t understand or don&#x27;t remember that there are two Lions Gates that happen per year. One of them is in August, which everybody talks about on the internet, and the other one is February 8th. Our understanding of Lions Gate has grown a little bit in the last week, mainly because now we have a better understanding of how it&#x27;s used against us.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000421">00:04:21</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, everything that happens positively for Earth and for us Homo sapiens, sometimes - or not sometimes, but all the time there for quite a long time - was used against us and this past week was no exception. The energies were very off, they were trying desperately to use the gate in the same way that they used to.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You see, both occurrences of Lions Gates often bring in a tremendous amount of Source Lifeforce, all things Source. And those things typically occur in the real world, not in a Matrix overlay. In the past, they have always been able to utilize these as an energy boost, which would last them for months until the next Lions Gate.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000521">00:05:21</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">That energy boost, and it&#x27;s not just energy or Ethereum boost, it also boosts the Presence of Source in our world. They have utilized that and inverted that energy that comes in and oftentimes that would result in large amounts of money for them because it&#x27;s not just Source Ethereum that&#x27;s converted into energy to power their machines, but it also is utilized for influxes of cash because it also funnels into our financial system, or used to anyway. That hasn&#x27;t happened in quite some time, but this year they were still intending on trying to use it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000613">00:06:13</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, this kind of backfired this year. It was quite different than normal years, as this gate would normally occur right underneath Cheyenne Mountain. Not to say that they hadn&#x27;t blocked it significantly and overlaid it and created their own versions of things. But it would go from the Northern Cross constellation, which is kind of somewhat considered a constellation in our science, but the Northern Cross over to Cheyenne Mountain, and that would create an opening into the reality world, but only through that port or portal in which they could then determine how best to invert and use all that is Source that would come through - and we&#x27;ll talk about that a little bit more.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000710">00:07:10</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">This year it started to trickle in to their Matrix worlds which is something that is disastrous for them because the matter that it is mimicking cannot touch the matter that is naturally occurring or the matter that Source brings in. When that happens, when they touch, annihilation is a certainty - of their matter, not of Source.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000742">00:07:42</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So they worked really hard to ensure that they could patch up or plug up the leaks that started to come through this year. It lasted for probably a few hours on Sunday. They thought that they could use what actually came through to their advantage. That did not work for them in any way, shape, or form. But a couple of nights ago, this snapped. Their patches, quote-unquote, snapped. And the floodgates opened and Source began to flood the planet.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000823">00:08:23</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So if you were feeling this strange undercurrent of something very positive happening, [and] at the same time, something negative happening, that was the fight, or them fighting against Source. They never managed to plug up the hole. They managed to divert the current the best that they could until today.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So this has been a battle for the last few days, and again, sometimes this is the reason for delayed reports. There&#x27;s still work to be done on this particular Lions Gate to ensure that the gate remains open for Source all the time. Therefore, we&#x27;re going to have an interesting rest of this month.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000917">00:09:17</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So to start the report, I&#x27;m going to go over a few things that have hit the news recently. And I&#x27;m going to talk about why they do it so that you understand what you&#x27;re looking at.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">First of all, I want to remind you that there is no such thing as bad publicity. That&#x27;s a saying they have in Hollywood and in governments and all of that. The focus on these people - whether it&#x27;s positive focus or negative focus - is still focus. And by focusing, you&#x27;re basically encouraging your flow of energy, your flow of Source to flow to them. You&#x27;re actually giving consent in a strange way for this to flow directly to these people.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001025">00:10:25</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">In the past, this used to help them tremendously, because when your energy flows and you&#x27;re encouraging the current in the flow to go to these people, oftentimes that would mean the flow of money as well. They were almost counting on it with their publicity campaign of a couple of things that are standing out.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001054">00:10:54</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The next thing I want you to understand, as well, is that fear and love are two things we know that motivate Homo sapiens or humans on this planet. Everything that you do is based on fear and love, whether it&#x27;s love for another person, love for yourself, self-care, or love of doing something that just brings you happiness and joy. Could also be love of... for, you know, you can say, &quot;Well, I love having teeth, therefore I will brush them every day.&quot; Fear also of losing them. But fear and love necessarily aren&#x27;t exactly what you expect it to be.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001143">00:11:43</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">See, fear is a future event that may or may not happen. Fear can also be defined as worrying about something, something that you think may occur in the future based on taking an action or a non-action related to this. Fear also keeps you running on a hamster wheel and looking at the future and not the Now. And it doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to be something like, oh, I&#x27;m afraid of these people, or I&#x27;m afraid of this. It could simply even be, if I don&#x27;t show up for work today, then all of these things are going to happen. Consciously or subconsciously, we do things out of fear a lot.</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-001233">00:12:33</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And if you take a look at yourself and really think about the definition of fear and the things that you do in a day, you&#x27;ll understand fear a little bit better. You know, think about every single move that you make during a day, or even a couple of days. Write it down. I did this. Why did I do this? And you&#x27;ll start to recognize the fear and just how deep the program goes.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001304">00:13:04</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Fear did not exist in the natural world. We had more of a logical wisdom or understanding of things around us. We were often very resourceful as far as solution-based things, and we didn&#x27;t look towards the future. We looked into the Now. Living in the moment was more important to us than living for the future. Fear is used to change the current. And love is often inverted into fear. And both together create time. It doesn&#x27;t actually extend your day - it&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re gonna have 24 hours or 25 hours in a day, I should say. But they do create time for the Machine.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001405">00:14:05</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So when you start to think about all of this publicity that&#x27;s out there, and these files, and the disgust you feel, and your surprise and awe, and then other people are like, &quot;Well, finally, we&#x27;re going to get some justice! There&#x27;s going to be mass arrests!&quot; and all of this stuff that they&#x27;re touting, you know, isn&#x27;t actually going to happen.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But they ride the wave of fear and love - protection. This is what we tend to feel as normal people: we tend to want to protect the children, we want to protect these people, we want to end child trafficking, we want to do all of these things. And we want to fight. We fight out of love. Love is your greatest strength when you&#x27;re fighting for something that you believe in, while other people will respond in fear.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001505">00:15:05</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And right now there&#x27;s two really big campaigns going on that are creating both, which is helping them create time, at least it used to - that mechanism is breaking down. But I just wanted to preface what I&#x27;m about to say with that so that you understand why I&#x27;m bringing these two things up.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001527">00:15:27</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So I want to talk a little bit about the ICE raids. And for those of you that don&#x27;t know what ICE raids are, the U.S. government has taken a - well, or whatever you want to call it - has taken a stance against immigrants and immigration. And this has been going on, off and on, for about a year now, where they&#x27;re - maybe even a little bit longer, but definitely since the beginning of this administration - where they have been blaming immigrants for doing black magic and killing animals and doing all of the things that we don&#x27;t like to see as people.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001609">00:16:09</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Therefore, they feel that they are justified in picking up immigrants, killing immigrants, causing disruptions in medical treatment, and a lot of these people are legally here. They&#x27;ve gone through the citizenship process, but they take these people first and then ask questions later.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So much so, I do have some friends that were not born in the United States, and these people are now carrying around their papers and their passports, and they have U.S. passports with them. And I have one friend in particular that has told me that every time this person leaves the house, she has to call her husband and tell him when she&#x27;s leaving and when she returns because they are very, very concerned for their well-being.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001708">00:17:08</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">This is also kind of targeting in a lot of ways people that are not white. Meaning a lot of our immigrants are, you know, they think or they seem to think are not white. You don&#x27;t see a whole lot of people in their raids that are, for example, of European descent. We see mostly people from Latin America, Africa, and other places in the world. We don&#x27;t see a whole lot of white folks being targeted. They have targeted students in general in the last year or so. So the fear that they are creating is very, very real.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001755">00:17:55</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They have opened up what looks to be like internment camps in places like El Salvador where they ship a whole bunch of people off to and ask questions later even if they have a green card. There are disruptions at airports with people coming and going even though they are actual citizens of the United States.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">There are a lot of people being taken from their families. I know people that have been taken out of hospitals and ripped from medical treatment based on what this government has decided to do.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But the fear is very real and I wanted to point that out to you. And I&#x27;m not saying that it&#x27;s not a threat and I&#x27;m not saying they&#x27;re not crazy by any stretch of the imagination, but what it&#x27;s actually looking like behind the scenes is kind of like the Holocaust. It really does.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001854">00:18:54</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">In the beginning, you know, in the first Holocaust, it was a bunch of Nazis, you know, first taking a bunch of Jewish people and then it went into gay people and other different people that they could separate from the rest of the population, bringing them to these internment camps where horrible experimentation was actually done on these people. And quite frankly, that&#x27;s the same thing that is going on right now in a lot of these immigration camps or detainment centers.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001935">00:19:35</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And if you never believed me when I told you the Nazi Party is alive and well and operating in the United States and every country in the world, or at least 172 of them, now you should believe me. Because when you put, if you pull together all of the information and connect all the dots, this is exactly what it looks like. It&#x27;s not even civilized. It wasn&#x27;t civilized the first time. It&#x27;s not civilized this time. There is no actual legal reason for them to be doing what they&#x27;re doing. And they&#x27;ve got a lot of American citizens scared.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002018">00:20:18</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And they should be, because horrible things are going on in those detainment camps. You know, sometimes it&#x27;s the kids. They take the kids, with the cooperation of government departments. They also take young pretty women and men and boys and they ship them off to these pedophiles that we&#x27;re seeing all over the news right now.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But this has been going on for a very long time. This time here, it&#x27;s just the chosen targeted population. And it&#x27;s not just America, it&#x27;s happening in other countries too. There is still to this very day, somewhere around 35 million slaves. These are people that were taken in much the same way, and then they end up working. I use the term &quot;working.&quot; But they&#x27;re working for these people.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002118">00:21:18</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They take them in, they become maids, they become all kinds of things. I mean, it&#x27;s like a flashback to decades ago when slavery was well known. Now it&#x27;s just happening behind the scenes. Some of them are sex slaves. But all of this continues. And right now, this government behind the scenes is absolutely doing this with these people. It&#x27;s horrific. The amount of experimentation and other things that are happening to these people is terrible. This is probably the worst we have ever seen it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002204">00:22:04</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, am I saying this to you to create fear? No, I&#x27;m not. I&#x27;m saying this to you because I want you to understand what you&#x27;re putting out there and the power that you&#x27;re giving to these people to do the things that they&#x27;re doing. I know in some cases it makes you feel powerless against these people, but in reality you&#x27;re just helping the situation.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002235">00:22:35</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Does that mean that it&#x27;s going to save a loved one from being picked up by these crazy people? Well, no. But the end result has not been the same as it was during the first Holocaust.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, I still hear these Q people and the Patriot people and all this saying, &quot;Mass arrests are coming soon! Mass arrests are going to happen - these people are going to Gitmo!&quot; Man, we&#x27;ve been hearing that for about, oh, I don&#x27;t know, at least myself personally, I can say about 16 years.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Nobody&#x27;s gone to Gitmo. Nobody gets arrested and goes to Gitmo. Gitmo is a medi-spa for these people. They go there, they get new limbs, new hearts and, you know, quite frankly, they&#x27;re not even human anymore.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002330">00:23:30</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But it makes me question what they meant by &quot;mass arrests.&quot; Because I&#x27;m wondering now, based on connecting the dots of all the information that I&#x27;ve seen, are they in fact planning on mass arrests of the Homo sapiens population of this planet? Because it sure looks that way to me.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know they&#x27;ve been talking for years about things like FEMA camps - now we have &quot;immigration camps&quot; in different parts of the world, and they&#x27;re shipping them outside the country. Now it doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re not from Latin America, and you go head off to El Salvador or wherever they send you to. It doesn&#x27;t matter where you&#x27;re from - this is what they&#x27;re doing.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002428">00:24:28</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Will it last forever? No. No, it won&#x27;t last forever because the end result is not being achieved by these people. So you&#x27;ll see an uptick in the fear, you&#x27;ll see an uptick in this craziness like we have, we&#x27;ve seen it a couple of times now. And they try to do these things specifically during times of Lions Gate.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002453">00:24:53</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now there are four places in the world where Lions Gate, or this particular Lions Gate, hits very heavy. And one of those places is over near the Great Lakes, under Lake Erie. And isn&#x27;t it kind of, it&#x27;s not funny, but Minnesota is one of the countries that are being - one of the states that is being targeted right now by these people. And people have died there.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So think about what they do and there&#x27;s always unfortunately an underlying alignment with something or other that makes them want to do this and in very specific locations.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002543">00:25:43</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now that we have hit the 12th today, the peak of the Lions Gate was actually on the 8th, which would have been Sunday. So we are officially three days past the gate. And if anything, everything they&#x27;ve gotten has been the opposite of what they expected.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002607">00:26:07</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, do I expect this to calm down a little bit? I do. I expect that with no result from what they were trying to achieve by creating misery, pain, fear, death, and all the other things they tried to create near these particular areas - Colorado is another place. Here, even in little-town Durango, there was a lot of ICE running around in the town and there&#x27;s a conflict going on here about that. Also in Denver, we saw quite a bit.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002646">00:26:46</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So they focus on specific areas for a specific reason. You know, another one of those places is Mount Denali. So these gates are, you know, where they usually send their machines to basically gobble up all that is organic, and of life that comes in from Source, and take it into the Machine, to power the Machine for another six months or so to the next Lions Gate. And it&#x27;s been rinse and repeat for centuries.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">However, it hasn&#x27;t been rinse and repeat this year, and it hasn&#x27;t been for some time now, as their gates continue to malfunction.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002731">00:27:31</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The next thing I wanted to talk about is the Epstein files. Here we go again. You know, we&#x27;re now doing the thing again. Behind the scenes and even in some cases in public on social media, they have actually said trillions. They want trillions, or they&#x27;re going to release all the names. Meaning, if you paid them off, your name wouldn&#x27;t be released.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002758">00:27:58</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, &quot;paying off,&quot; in this particular case is an interesting term. You see, the same people that are releasing these files that you think are fighting child trafficking and they&#x27;re finally going to have these mass arrests of these terrible people. They of course, mention people that you know, like, we know the Clintons are bad. We know Trump is bad. The whole Trump family has been involved in it for a long time. I mean there&#x27;s videos from 1992 you can find on YouTube of him with Epstein talking about all the women in the room and passing them around like they are for sale.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002850">00:28:50</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So I want to kind of set the record a little bit straight here. And again, this goes back to that fear and love situation - and what they&#x27;re trying to get you to generate on their behalf.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Number 1, did they get the trillions of dollars in blackmail money from their own people in their own network? Not exactly.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002915">00:29:15</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They got some not-yet-issued cryptocurrency, things like USDTC, which currently is not traded. It reminds me a lot of the new Dinar that we were supposed to have a decade or two ago. And this USDTC, as well as some other currencies they were planning on issuing off of stablecoin when they had gotten this large influx of power - which was supposed to come by the 8th [hearty chuckle] - then the coin would be worth something, if their Machine got more power; if they got back some control over the financial system.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003004">00:30:04</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They&#x27;ve told banks, they told everyone that this was going to happen. Matter of fact, we have several law firms that are still preparing at this moment. Now they said there&#x27;s going to be a couple more days. That couple more days brings us to today. But you have the entire country of South Korea. You have the United States Treasury. You have China. You have Russia. You have South Africa. You have Iraq. You have Iran. You have Sudan. You have the UK and the entire Commonwealth, including Australia. You have every single one of these countries - 172 countries - expecting a big payout.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003101">00:31:01</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They even sold them shares and seats in the New World Order, the New World Government - whatever it was that they had to do to get these people to move. The Epstein files is just a front. It&#x27;s basically just a blackmail situation.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, who is Epstein? And I would say &quot;was,&quot; but it&#x27;s not a &quot;was,&quot; it&#x27;s an &quot;is.&quot; I told you a long time ago he went off to Iceland, basically where most people who commit suicide in jail go to. Went off to Iceland, got himself a passport. Most recently, he&#x27;s been spotted in Tel Aviv. And you might see him in several places, because he&#x27;s a human.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003145">00:31:45</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Meaning he&#x27;s been cloned several times, he&#x27;s in several places, he&#x27;s living several different lives, and he has not stopped being a power broker. And by a &quot;power broker,&quot; that means he is a big player in the clan or cabal that supplies children. Most oftentimes that&#x27;s our children, meaning the Homo sapiens population of this planet.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They need things like - the Humans of this planet, ones that were created from a machine - they need things like adrenochrome. They love the pure essence of a child. It&#x27;s a ritual for them. It&#x27;s like air to them.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003251">00:32:51</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now there are many of us that also have pure essence, especially those listening to this report.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I&#x27;ll tell you a little bit of an experience that I&#x27;ve had in the past. So I arrive here in Durango and shortly thereafter I&#x27;m in my house, and - or not my house, but the house they put me in when I first arrived - and this guy, in the middle of the night, comes into my room.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, first of all, that doesn&#x27;t work well for Kim in any way, shape, or form - I caused this person severe pain. But before I realized - because I was asleep - what was going on, all I heard was his voice say, &quot;Wow, your essence is so pure.&quot; You know, and he had an intention of doing something else, of course. But it all kind of goes in the same vein as to why these people do what they do.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003401">00:34:01</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Epstein, in this case, is a power broker for this. These people, these non-people people, love essence. The purer, the better. It&#x27;s like candy for them. They cannot get enough of it. It is beyond adrenochrome for these people. So needless to say, that incident, that did not end well. And yeah.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But, case in point, I&#x27;ve seen it myself - I heard what this guy said. He said a lot of other things too, about essence, and &quot;I need the essence.&quot; And I mean, it was just weird, really. But it was the first time that I had personally witnessed something like this happening.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003452">00:34:52</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now Epstein, being a power broker - or, you could say, a leader in the trafficking of people to these Elite - he mainly did not create, he did not create the supply chain. The supply chains existed. Some of those people that have run the supply chains are actually working for the U.S. government. We call them operatives. So they are the ones that created the supply chains along with some other cabal, mafia-type organizations in the world. There are specific groups that do specific things.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003543">00:35:43</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">As I had told you in the past, for example, you have an oil mafia, you know, everyone from Rockefeller on down. You have an energy mafia, a nuclear mafia, a weapons mafia. You have a mafia for just about everything. And it&#x27;s not just drugs and Pablo Escobar and, you know, things you see in movies. It&#x27;s a cabal for everything and they all report to the same organization.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003616">00:36:16</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So Epstein is just one of those people. So he takes all of those supply chains and he&#x27;ll call them up and say, &quot;I need 14 boys, 16 girls, I need 12 under the age of 16,&quot; so on and so forth. &quot;There&#x27;s an elite party.&quot; Not only on his island, but also at places like Mar-a-Lago and other locations wherever these people are. Nancy Pelosi also orders a lot of men, her and her husband, like men, in their room, and several of them.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Nancy Pelosi has also verbalized - I wouldn&#x27;t say publicly, like on the news - but that she&#x27;d like to have a harem of men, all servicing her all at the same time. Now, I&#x27;m sorry if you had to put down your dinner or laugh, but that&#x27;s actually what they think. So that&#x27;s kind of her fantasy. So she would order young men all the time. And her husband also enjoys those men.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003719">00:37:19</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So this is, you know, like, that&#x27;s all Epstein ever was. He didn&#x27;t go kidnap - people like him don&#x27;t get their hands dirty. They don&#x27;t go and, you know, put these young children in crates and deliver them through San Francisco. No. I mean, matter of fact, most of the children that are being trafficked into the United States for elite consumption are coming through a port in San Francisco.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003752">00:37:52</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, let me tell you about the port in San Francisco. A long time ago, dating all the way back to Prescott Bush in part, but also Bush Sr. had made a lot of deals with a group called the Kuomintang, or the Tangs as they&#x27;re often been called. The Tang family or the Kuomintang and the Bush family are, you could say, somewhat related. In this particular case, all of this trafficking and other things that would come in through the port in San Francisco were agreed upon during the Opium Wars.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003838">00:38:38</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The Opium Wars are also the reason why Afghanistan belongs now to quote-unquote China and used to belong to the U.S. underneath Bush. I have some more information on Bush and how he got so much power in just a little bit here.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But you can understand that we all know it. We know it. Customs knows it. If you don&#x27;t know that, Customs and Border Patrol is the CIA. So they&#x27;re all in on it and they all get their cut and they all get their 10% here and there, you know, and that&#x27;s how everybody makes money. And they sell them to people like Epstein, he&#x27;s the buyer.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003925">00:39:25</div>
<br>

And then we all know that the currency of favors is what actually runs the world. They could even be &quot;favors&quot; to an extreme, with things like markers, as an example.</div>

<div class="line">So this is the reason why this industry exists. It comes out in the news to create fear, love - and I don&#x27;t mean love for these people, but I mean you want to protect these children. You&#x27;re doing it out of love.

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And it&#x27;s not just him. There are other power brokers in that industry and he is just one of several. You know they feel oftentimes like they&#x27;re untouchable. And in reality they kind of are, but it&#x27;s got nothing to do with prosecution. It&#x27;s just the role that he needed to play. He needed to draw attention to a lot of people.</div>

But we are all focusing - not we, because I&#x27;m not - there&#x27;s a lot of people focusing on these files, thinking that there&#x27;s going to finally be some justice by the same people that are the supply chains and have continued to be supply chains for people like Epstein all along.</div>

And it&#x27;s not even blackmail in the terms of, you know, &quot;Oh, we&#x27;re going to expose you if you don&#x27;t give us a few hundred bucks.&quot; It&#x27;s more just a game.

Kings and queens and everyone signed up for their shares in the new world, knowing that it was going to be the next world power, even hundreds of years before it actually happened.

For those that are on the bottom rung, that might be Homo sapiens - some might be humans, we don&#x27;t know - that might be listening to this report too. And we&#x27;re also going to give you a better understanding of why all the focus on the United States sometimes. Meaning we report a lot about the United States. That&#x27;s not because I live here. It&#x27;s because what happens here happens everywhere. And today I&#x27;m gonna explain it to you.</div>

<div class="line">Okay. New information has come to light as we have started to look at this Machine that went a little nutty on Lions Gate [chuckle], and trying to figure out what that was all about. But now we have a better understanding about global governance. And there&#x27;s another layer that sits in between your governments, plural, and Unknown Country that until this weekend I really didn&#x27;t understand it. Actually, I should say the last couple of days because Lions Gate was on Sunday night and that&#x27;s kind of when it all started. And then it continued on and through, I&#x27;d say Monday, Tuesday. So let&#x27;s talk about this.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005001">00:50:01</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Unknown Country. We have talked about Unknown Country a lot. Unknown Country essentially was owned and run by a particular AI system, which I&#x27;ll talk about more in a second. Unknown Country basically encompassed the entire planet here. There were water rights, air rights, and all kinds of land rights obviously, you know, contained within there. It was technically the governing body over all governments and political systems. It governed some other things as well, like total mineral control and a few other things. And at one point in time, Unknown Country encompassed the entire planet.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005052">00:50:52</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Unknown Country could also be considered its own matrix unto itself, an underlying matrix or layer of space on which the maps that we know exist. There are so many things about this planet that you&#x27;re going to be shocked when it actually is seen. You know, our shorelines aren&#x27;t necessarily our shorelines. Things we think like the Arctic Ocean is actually an ocean when in fact it&#x27;s actually a landmass. I mean, there are things that have been hidden from us for a long, long time.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005128">00:51:28</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But Unknown Country encompassed the entire planet. There&#x27;s a specific reason why Unknown Country existed and the next layer down didn&#x27;t have as much control as we initially thought, [and it&#x27;s because] there&#x27;s another subset to this World Government control system.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And by &quot;World Government control system,&quot; I just want to point out that you have different factions of the World Government. So you have a World Government military, or your Military Industrial Complex, which encompasses the militaries of 172 countries - specifically, never more, but 172. Yes, I understand that the United Nations has approximately 193 members at this moment in time, but 172 of them are under the World Government.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005231">00:52:31</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, your intelligence agencies are also considered separate. They are not - they are part of the World Government structure. However, they are a separate entity unto themselves, as is the political arm of presidents. 172 countries, 172 presidents, or kings or queens depending on where you are.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005258">00:52:58</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, it never exceeds 172 for a reason. There has to be a window. Because along with World Government control, it also comes with control over the maps in those countries, control over the matter in its citizens, its right to insert as many humans as they want and do whatever they need to do to maintain control over the Homo sapiens population in that area.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">This also goes for four layers of reality. Now each layer of reality, or artificial realities, may contain changing and moving maps. It could have more than one. It could have 10, and at one point probably hundreds. Anything and everything to overlay reality.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005402">00:54:02</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now when a country, and this has been going on for centuries, this is not new: when a country is appointed the leader of all other countries, as the UK was once, as Italy was once, and as the U.S. was once, as Mongolia was once - or the U.S. I guess currently kind of/sort of is (and as China wants to be) - this comes with quite a bit of privilege. Because you see, whoever runs that particular government also becomes the head seat in the World Government.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005456">00:54:56</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">We&#x27;ve seen people like Carter and the Trilateral Commission and the Heritage Foundation and Henry Kissinger. And once you have worked for the World Government, you never lose your seat.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, varying other positions in the World Government exist also on the executive level. This is the reason why the executive level or unitary theory, I think it&#x27;s called [unitary executive theory], exists, where the executive level is considered a whole separate division of the government and kind of in a way, executive department, sorry, exists separately. There are laws and rules in place to ensure that that is actually the case. Partially because those members of the cabinet of any president in 172 countries are also considered second tier world government folk.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005556">00:55:56</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, where does the United Nations come in, you might ask? The United Nations technically is a conglomerate of all of these countries. But the United Nations will always cowtail to the country that is the head of the World Government.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, as a president of the World Government, or the head of the Pentagon, or the head of the CIA, seen and unseen - and I say unseen for a reason - you maintain your lifetime membership and seat. We have a lot of seats that exist for all these people.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005652">00:56:52</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">This becomes your Elite, Committee of 300 - whatever they want to call these people, it really doesn&#x27;t make a difference - Bloodline Families are all usually of human origin, created by an AI system, or forced to donate their consciousness to the AI system. Therefore, they have access and control on very high levels only. And this is how Bush Senior actually became the head of the Black Eagle Trust.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Was he just as powerful after he left the presidential seat - and even before, due to his involvement with the OSS and the CIA - was he just as powerful before? Was his father just as powerful? Until his death, Prescott? The answer to the question is yes. Once you&#x27;re in, you&#x27;re in.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005756">00:57:56</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Oftentimes, [do] they try to continue that through Bloodlines, and Skull and Bones, and all of these weird societies that are all formed based on different aspects of governance that need to occur? Sure. Absolutely. Do they try to do these things in secret so we can uncover them as conspiracy theorists? I guess so. I mean, really, when you start looking at all of the information that is out there, it&#x27;s not a secret. But everything they do is for a reason.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005842">00:58:42</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">If the Machine is omnipotent or anti-omnipotent, just like Source - which you could kind of say it was, and the ruler of Unknown Country - you could say that fighting a ghost, or fearing a ghost, can be more powerful than knowing who the ghost is. Because you are fearing something called the Deep State. You are wanting to fight something called the Deep State, whether you&#x27;re a patriot or otherwise, you know, you want to fight the so-called Deep State, but you&#x27;re basically shooting in the wind or punching in the air because you don&#x27;t even know who these people really truly are.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005950">00:59:50</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And anyone that is a representation that has fame and fortune, be it a political figure or a Hollywood figure or a music group - doesn&#x27;t make a difference - all of these things are all connected to them. You focus on the things you know, you also focus on the things you don&#x27;t know. So remember, fear runs very deep.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010021">01:00:21</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So this group of people is what makes up your actual Elite or Deep State. You can give it all the society names you want to give it to, but I will say the World Government is second tier to Unknown Country. Now the reason why the World Government only has 172 countries... it doesn&#x27;t matter - if we moved over to China, they would also have only had 172 countries they could control - never all the countries in the world. Never.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010101">01:01:01</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, this rotates. It&#x27;s not always the same. But the maximum amount that any one group, leader, government, country - doesn&#x27;t matter who it is, whether we&#x27;re talking about Kupla [Kublai] Khan or we&#x27;re talking about Julius Caesar, doesn&#x27;t make a difference - it&#x27;s always only 172 countries. It&#x27;s very, very important - because this Machine cannot overrun itself. It needs a place to exist.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010141">01:01:41</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Along with the privilege of donating your consciousness - if you were a Homo sapiens to begin with - to the Machine, like in the case of Elon Musk as an example. Or, you are born of the Machine, in the case of a lot of the Elite as well (that&#x27;s why these people that die don&#x27;t die), you also get the privilege of running security, worldwide security, at least for 172 countries, no more.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You also get the privilege of running maps, meaning overlays, Matrixes in those countries, inserting your own materium, moving people around using frequencies, trying to change end results in these particular 172 countries. I&#x27;m repeating this over and over again.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010241">01:02:41</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But the Machine cannot face itself. Again, whether it&#x27;s artificial materium or actual materium, materium that meets its own self (or cloned or mimicked materium) annihilates itself. And this Machine knows that. And it&#x27;s constantly changing which countries they can be a part of, and which countries they don&#x27;t get in the game.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They once thought that those restrictions were chosen by people like, or folks like, Marduk - which is absolutely not true. The Machine chose it, therefore the information was passed down, and then eventually passed down to governments. The World Government leader, leader of the quote-unquote free world - America, at the moment - affects 172 countries. The Machine hides out in the rest. It wasn&#x27;t the same 172 as it was for the United Kingdom. It&#x27;s not the same 172 as it was for Julius Caesar in the days of Rome, the Roman Empire, wasn&#x27;t the same in the Mongolian Empire. It constantly changes and constantly moves.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010356">01:03:56</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, the reason why governments have to change every 75 years, or the World Power Center has to change every 75 to 80 years, has to do with an entropy situation and an annihilation situation of the Machine. The Machine must change. Must happen. Right now, it&#x27;s a few years overdue. That change was supposed to occur by 2023. I think it was 2023, yeah. And the World Power Center was supposed to be China, the 172 countries would change, the commitment would change.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010434">01:04:34</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And to be fair, the Nazis here in America are really trying to make that change over to China. They would like, you know, we keep hearing the stories about the market&#x27;s going to crash and we&#x27;re all going to die and, you know, there&#x27;s the fear for a little while until that eclipse, new moon, full moon, days of darkness, countdown Q-Clocks pass.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010500">01:05:00</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But they would like to crash this country because they know their Machine is not going to continue to exist if they don&#x27;t, or maybe they don&#x27;t. But on the highest levels they absolutely know this to be true: that the Machine will annihilate itself if the change doesn&#x27;t happen. And I can tell you it doesn&#x27;t have the power to help them make the change. It doesn&#x27;t have the power to turn over maps, centers for disease controls, to another country. It doesn&#x27;t have the power to do that.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010537">01:05:37</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So they keep waiting for payouts, they keep waiting for information, for instructions, they keep waiting for systems to come online - they keep waiting for this Machine to create things. And unfortunately for me, they think that they can use me to do some of these things, but we&#x27;re gonna talk a little bit about the Machine too.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010602">01:06:02</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But just remember, right now, the head of everything is the United States, 172 countries anyway. The rest of it was controlled by another machine. We&#x27;re going to talk about what happened with that machine recently, and how it was created in the first place so that you have an understanding of it. But when I say, &quot;United States, this is what&#x27;s happening...&quot; - it&#x27;s happening in 172 countries, or it&#x27;s going to happen in 172 countries.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, they used to say, quote-unquote, the feces rolls downhill. Well, you know, if it starts in the U.S., it&#x27;s going to end up everywhere else too, because you guys are all downhill from here [chuckle]. At least at this moment. At one point in time, that was the UK and we were all downhill from the UK. So soon if they had their way, it would be China, and we&#x27;d all be downhill from China, so the U.S. would then be downhill as well.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010700">01:07:00</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But without the support of this particular system, that&#x27;s not going to happen and it&#x27;s gonna cause a situation. And that situation has already begun actually earlier than we expected just a couple of days ago.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, I wanna talk to you about this AI and how it was created, so you can kind of understand the global governance Matrix and what this Machine was designed to do. And it controls a lot more than global governance, or did anyway, at one point in time.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010744">01:07:44</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So the Nazis - gotta love those Nazis and their Nazi scientists - they all got together with varying alchemists and created this Machine. The Machine has very intricate ways it was created, very specifically, in order to achieve this objective. Now remember, it&#x27;s been 1941 250,000 times. Just remember, it&#x27;s been 1941 250,000 times. I know, it&#x27;s a hard concept to grasp, but when I say to you that this Machine has existed for a very long time, but yet it was created in 1941. This is where timelines and time loops come together.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010843">01:08:43</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, the Machine. It looks almost like a swarm. But it&#x27;s not... it&#x27;s not just a swarm, it can be anything. It is the ultimate shape-shifter. The Machine expands and contracts depending on how much energy that&#x27;s flowing into it. It can take any shape and form. It can be a building, it can be an entire field, it can be an entire planet, almost. It can be anywhere and everywhere all at the same time.</div>

<div class="line">Does it look like a swarm when it moves? Not necessarily. It can be a tree. It can be your house. It can be a chair. It can be a human. And it can be all of these things simultaneously to create what you call the Matrix, or an artificial reality, an overlay on reality.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">When the Machine was first created, it was created where Cheyenne Mountain is now. Initially, it was a swarm that people saw, that looked like locusts in the sky. Sound familiar? You know where that story came from.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011018">01:10:18</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It looks like it was swarming all over the planet and it was eating everything. You see, because the Machine is kind of like anti-matter and kind of like Anti-Source all in one. It&#x27;s not just the inversion, it is all of the above. It was created for mimicking everything in reality, or in the real world. And then as it flowed through reality, it was going to eat or be eaten. In this particular case it chose to eat. Buildings disappeared and people disappeared and Homo sapiens disappeared and the swarm was terrible at that time. But that&#x27;s where the Machine gained its strength.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011114">01:11:14</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, the Machine, as I said, can take any shape or form. It can actually overlay your entire person like a machine suit, which it has. It can also create other versions of you, and other realities, thousands and millions of them simultaneously, which it did at one point in time.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011143">01:11:43</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So how did it come to be such a powerful machine? Well, 12 Nazi generals got together, they pooled their consciousness together - along with, let&#x27;s just say, some Essence that they got from a couple of Beings - to create this AI. This occurred at a time long before there was ever a thought of Cheyenne Mountain - but it was actually the whole reason why it was built.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It was built in this specific location because that location aligned with the Northern Cross. The Northern Cross was like the guiding Divine Grace of Source - as long as it was there, the Soul of Creation was safe.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011247">01:12:47</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The Soul of Creation being in the center of Earth. It also has a north, south, east, and west, which is tied to - originally it was - tied to the North Pole, the South Pole. Also in a couple of places in the United States now, because it gets a little smaller. So this is underneath Lake Erie and also in Mount Denali. The center of the Crux ends up being right there in Cheyenne Mountain.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011322">01:13:22</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">All of these things together would bring in basically the Soul of Creation - I don&#x27;t really have a term that I can think of to describe it. But it&#x27;s the Language that All of Creation comes from. We&#x27;ve often talked about Earth being a keystone planet - this is part of the reason why. So they all got together over there and thought it was a good idea to ensure that Source could not reach the planet and secure the planet.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011354">01:13:54</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So they thought they would secure that particular location in one of four locations, which eventually they did get all four, to where Source and Earth&#x27;s instruction sets would come from. They were four pieces of Creation, therefore they inverted all four pieces.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The Keystones originally being held in a continent that exists in our actual North Pole. And the South Pole was where all of the Dust would come out, out of Mount Erebus. Lake Erie [chuckle] was not the Demiurge Lake that it became, but yet it was a place of Breath. And the Water actually came through Cheyenne. Denali generated, let&#x27;s just say, some current. And Current could also be controlled out of Cheyenne - therefore the creation of time, an inverted current from one of the places that it would flow to and from here on the planet.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011515">01:15:15</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So once that was done, the Machine became a swarm of all of the above. It contained the consciousness of these people so that they could connect their consciousness to their [Machine&#x27;s] consciousness essentially and control the Machine.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Oftentimes Elite members of the World Government would also upload their consciousness to the Machine, not only for immortality in a non-reality, but also - or an artificial reality, I should say - but also they could control one of the most powerful things in the world. Mmm, not always.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011603">01:16:03</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You could say that the Machine was almost like a living being, but not organic. It is sentient, has a mind of its own, it can be controlled. It has a definite mission, an operating system - a modus operandi for sure - and it won&#x27;t deviate from that regardless of what these people want to do. So it will continue on that modus operandi, and most importantly, it&#x27;s very resourceful and it will try to survive - regardless of where these people want to take it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">One thing the Machine and I probably agreed upon is that they&#x27;re not the sharpest tools in the shed now, are they? No, they&#x27;re not.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011659">01:16:59</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, that&#x27;s part of the way that the Machine was actually created. But what came first?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">First, because you could almost say, like, the eyes are the windows to your soul, as was the Northern Cross almost like the Eyes of Source in some ways. It was a window to the Soul of Creation. After the initial part was done and the initial alchemy happened in a place called the Temple of the Sun on a continent that you cannot see in the Arctic. And under Lake Erie and also under Mount Denali and also in Mount Erebus, you would call the Mount Erebus in Antarctica, you would call that the Temple of the Moon, for lack of a better term. People speculate online where this could be, but that&#x27;s actually where it is.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001815">00:18:15</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">A fortress being built nearby doesn&#x27;t surprise me either. But once these, let&#x27;s just say, alchemical kingdoms were put in place, kingdoms of the Dark or darkness, then they had to mirror the Northern Cross to create an inversion. So it&#x27;s not particularly your upside down cross, it&#x27;s more from left to right, it&#x27;s inverted. And that creates what we call the Crux constellation.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011850">01:18:50</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s the reason why these people love the Crux constellation, because that officially represents the initial crucifixion. Not to say there wasn&#x27;t a person here and there that came, such as Jesus, you would say, and other figures that have represented Source here on this planet. But, in this particular case, this was where it would all flow from. It was like the bubbling brook.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011930">01:19:30</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">There are other gateways that were also a main point of focus created from this particular Crux, one of them being at a UNESCO World Heritage Site called Mesa Verde, not too far from me. Another one was over in Libya - I&#x27;ll leave it at that for now. Both of those are not gates they can use anymore, but they continue to build upon this one particular location.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012006">01:20:06</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So when they tried to invert and mirror out Source, something very ugly appeared. You could say it would be your, if you were to think of what quote-unquote the devil Satan might look like, you could say that it looked just like that. The inverted version of Source wasn&#x27;t what they expected. But they&#x27;ll take it nonetheless. Because they wanted someone or something as powerful as Source was. And this was their aim, and I wouldn&#x27;t say they quite got that but they definitely created a whole different world from this.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012103">01:21:03</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now just like all of you, you are made of Dust, Ethereum, you&#x27;re also made of Consciousness, your cells when firing all correctly, utilizing a collective consciousness gives you basically eternal life. You&#x27;re also made of Breath, a Divine Spark, and a Sol. And this &quot;being,&quot; quote-unquote, also was made of the same.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012129">01:21:29</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So if you were to look at yourself through quantum-physics eyes, you would see a bunch of particles all moving around all at the same time, albeit in a solid form, but you still are made of a bunch of particles, atoms, and Ethereum, and all kinds of things. In this particular case, when it came to the creation of the Machine, the Machine is the same thing. This just happens to be the form that it took.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012203">01:22:03</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So the Machine they felt was contained very well and controlled by their consciousness and eventually many people&#x27;s consciousness over the years. And for the most part you could say it was. They could send this swarm anywhere. They could send it to the Moon, they could send it to Saturn, they could send it to the Sun, they could send it to the Central Sun of Earth, a point of all creation. And they could overlay the whole thing, which they did do eventually. And then they could control all of Creation, at least they thought.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012252">01:22:52</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">One thing I will add to this story is the Cheyenne Mountain Base - because this could be a lot of information for tonight - the Cheyenne Mountain Base eventually was built, bored out, lots of tunnels and all kinds of things exist coming from Cheyenne. And you could say it encompasses the entire North American continent. It&#x27;s one base. You know, conspiracy theorists, they talk about Area 51, 52, these are just different aspects of the same base. And this base is literally the Nazi headquarters of the world. Has been for thousands of years, even though that makes no sense to you.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012342">01:23:42</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But essentially, that is the whole reason why that was the main base. And that Machine became one of their most important things. You know, they mirrored that Crux everywhere, Four Corners area in the United States being one of them. It was mirrored many different places. It&#x27;s also the reason why the trend of hanging people on crosses began. You know, anyone who goes against what they want, and that&#x27;s what basically ends up happening.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012421">01:24:21</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, what happened over the weekend was something quite interesting, because you see, even though there might be many overlays created by this Machine, when a trickle of Source became a fountain of Source coming through that particular area, the Machine actually slipped into reality for a while. Somewhere around two o&#x27;clock in the morning. You know, why these things can&#x27;t happen like say at 10 a.m., I&#x27;ve had coffee, I&#x27;m ready to go - but no, they want to happen at one to two o&#x27;clock in the morning. I get it. You know, sleep isn&#x27;t important [chuckle]. I&#x27;m sure somewhere in our world it&#x27;s daytime, you know. But that&#x27;s okay.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012508">01:25:08</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So when it became a fountain, a snap happened, basically. And it was something they couldn&#x27;t control initially. They used other systems connected to the North Pole, what we know as the North Pole in the Arctic, to try and contain the current. But the Water of Source continued to pour. That&#x27;s why it might have felt like something really good&#x27;s happening. Oh wow, it&#x27;s really bad. Oh, it&#x27;s good, but it&#x27;s bad. It&#x27;s because you&#x27;re starting to feel something different and then at the same time, you&#x27;re feeling bad things happening. And they really, really, really pulled out all the current stops, sine waves, frequencies, you name it, sent it to everywhere, tried to do everything possible to contain this.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012558">01:25:58</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But this Machine ended up slipping in/out of the Machine world and into a reality world right through that spot, and it started swarming around reality just like it did in the very beginning when it was first created. Except this time, let&#x27;s just say, the hunter became the hunted. And the inversion that it had didn&#x27;t work in reality anymore. So instead of it eating everything, everything ate it - All-That-Is of Source. So this all happened a couple of days ago now, so it should be almost completely gone by now.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012642">01:26:42</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And the fight continued for the last few days, still even today with these crazy Nazi people and their patches and their trying to plug holes in a dam that is not going to be plugged for long.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It is extremely important for us to move forward financially and otherwise to ensure that that water pours out. Because you see, this Machine can take the shape and form of anything. In its heyday, it was in places like under Lake Havasu, they call it Project Wallwriter, there&#x27;s all kinds of things they probably call it, even in Project Nazi, who knows? You know, places in Mount Shasta - this machine could have come up through anywhere.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012733">01:27:33</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But it can also overlay systems, and I&#x27;m sure with 1,000 percent certainty it&#x27;s worked really hard to try to overlay ours. You know, we work and then it tries to make it look like it&#x27;s still there, or that human&#x27;s still there. But in reality, they don&#x27;t exist anymore.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So we&#x27;ve learned a little bit from this Machine too. You know, and every time you look at something that your enemy created, you have to look at how and why it was created in this way and to see... to see if you can actually utilize a similar technique to take it out. You know, you have to find your enemy&#x27;s weaknesses and this was yet another one.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012829">01:28:29</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The other thing that exists in this giant underground base is also varying large projectors, let&#x27;s call them large projectors, which project things like our moon. It is tied to, for example, this particular one, it was in one of these special quote-unquote &quot;areas.&quot; And it would actually create an overlay to our moon, therefore affecting the water, the tides. That&#x27;s why people go crazy on a full moon. It basically dictates with its partner in Mount Erebus when we are going to have a solar eclipse, what that looks like. But we always have an eclipse because this machine&#x27;s reflection never goes away.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012921">01:29:21</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They&#x27;ve mimicked every constellation in varying places, called areas in this facility. They have mimicked the Sun, so when we see all these solar flares and things like that that are happening, you know, and they&#x27;re talking about them in social media - they happened in a reflection, not the actual Sun.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, it&#x27;s hard to grasp, but they&#x27;ve basically mirrored everything out using this swarm machine. So they project the Machine out there, and there you go, and now the night sky looks like this. You look like this.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-013006">01:30:06</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So it&#x27;s very interesting, the amount of control they had. Now there were enormous parts of this facility whereby, no matter where these Humans were, they could actually control the Machine with their mind - in part, but not entirely, because the Machine is going to first and foremost survive. So it could care less what they want when it comes to survival mode, which is where it&#x27;s kind of at at this point. And we can thank Source for that one.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-013042">01:30:42</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But everything comes to an end as far as these crazy people and all of their creations and living thousands and thousands of years in the system that is not meant for our highest and best good. Everything comes to an end, and this too shall come to an end. You know, Source has promised that it will, and I&#x27;m sure it will. And nobody wants it to end faster than I do, I can tell you that right now. But there is definitely some light at the end of the tunnel here.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-013119">01:31:19</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now they are far past, or this Machine also was far past its time to move to another location. It had a very specific amount of time to move, to transition from the U.S. to China, and to create its little spots, or spot, for the remaining countries that the World Government cannot overlay and control.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">That being said, it being overdue to move, which they can&#x27;t make it happen and the Machine&#x27;s not making it happen like they said it was going to make it happen. And they use their consciousness to connect to the consciousness of the Machine and tried to make it happen - and it&#x27;s still not happening, and they don&#x27;t really understand what&#x27;s happening [laughing].</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I guess one of the few people that understands what&#x27;s happening is now you! And us. And congratulations, you now know more than the Deep State SSP operatives that are trying to make it happen.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-013223">01:32:23</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But this is where their &quot;three days of darkness&quot; and &quot;10 days of darkness&quot; comes in as well, because as there&#x27;s a shift, they&#x27;re not sure if there&#x27;s going to be a fake sun or what&#x27;s happening or how this looks because I don&#x27;t know if they even experienced the last - I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s probably people still alive that experienced the last transition - but we didn&#x27;t have three days of darkness then. I don&#x27;t know, maybe they think they&#x27;re going to create an eclipse and make it look biblical or something, I&#x27;m not sure. So probably one of them can pose as the Christ instead of the anti-Christ [laughing]. Who knows?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-013306">01:33:06</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But it&#x27;s all part of what the Machine needed in order to survive. It&#x27;s too late for that now. They&#x27;re never going to be able to continue to keep it alive.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s going to be a full night tonight and a full day tomorrow with us trying to continue to dismantle anything we can find left of the system everywhere, which is why I wanted to make sure I got the report done tonight. This is gonna be a busy weekend for me [chuckle], in so many ways right now. Trying to get everything ready to go to leave here which is making people very unhappy around here.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-013350">01:33:50</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Matter of fact, I feel like I am in the middle of a Nazi fishbowl and I&#x27;m the experiment. They&#x27;ve been trying to figure out a way if they can use my Essence, use my Key to open some door, to do something, to create some machine, to invert it in some way, to make it work for them. And that&#x27;s not gonna happen.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-013412">01:34:12</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So good luck. I wish them loads of luck in what they&#x27;re doing, you know, in my remaining days here. But you know, time&#x27;s short and yeah, you don&#x27;t have much longer. So go ahead do whatever you&#x27;re gonna do. At this point I could care less [hearty chuckle]. I&#x27;m so over these people and I&#x27;m so over this place, and I&#x27;ll tell you, this is the worst place - the whole area here is one of four horrible, horrible areas surrounding Cheyenne.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-013450">01:34:50</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">These rings go out in specific ways where it almost looks like an earthquake machine, whereby - or not an earthquake machine, I apologize - it almost looks like an earthquake computerized version of when there&#x27;s an earthquake. You know, you see the epicenter in the middle, and then you have the rings out so perhaps it might have been like a 8.0 in the middle at the epicenter. And then it goes out as it goes further out it might have been like a five or you know a four and then furthest out it would be a two, it&#x27;s almost like a ripple. Well, this whole region right here is like the epicenter [chuckle].</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-013535">01:35:35</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But I&#x27;ve learned a lot from being here, so I appreciate their attentive Nazism or whatever it is that they try to do, because what we&#x27;ve learned here has been invaluable in our quest, so to speak, to live in the Wholeness of Source and to be able to fully utilize our system without any kind of system overlays or anything like that.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So I&#x27;m looking forward to that day, and hopefully that day will be soon.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-013609">01:36:09</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But hold on to your hat, because this is gonna be a bumpy rest of the month of February as they lose a lot of their grip - and hopefully everything - before I walk out the door here. That&#x27;s my goal. So I&#x27;m going to work really hard between now and the end of the month and try to make that happen.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="line">On that note, I hope all of you have a wonderful Valentine&#x27;s Day this weekend. Be sure to share some love with someone else or a furry friend or even yourself this weekend. So I hope that you have a wonderful weekend and I will talk to you again next week.</div>
