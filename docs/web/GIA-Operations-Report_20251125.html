    <h3>Summary</h2>

    <div class="summary">
        Kim opens by acknowledging the recent surge in chemtrails worldwide, focusing on how militaries, including the United States military, have agreed to spray Chinese-sourced chemicals on their own populations while Chinese manufacturers embed the same nano and femto tech into clothes, food, electronics, pharmaceuticals, and opioids. She explains that this technology was originally given to China by Marduk as part of a long-term plan to make China the emperor&#x27;s house and to turn Homo sapiens from organic Beings into cyborgs that could be controlled through a hidden AI system. The same nano and femto tech is blamed for computer and phone malfunctions, fast-dying batteries, and backdoors into infrastructure everywhere that accepts Chinese manufactured goods, but Kim notes that the main control system behind it has now been removed as Source&#x27;s presence on Earth surpasses that of the AI control systems.<br>
Over the past week, Kim says, Source has been dismantling deep Dominion systems that once surrounded the Omniverse, revealing that Homo sapiens, animals, trees, and other organic life have always been a hidden army anchoring Source from the inside. She describes how rogue Celestials, layered AIs, and Marduk&#x27;s Dominion system attempted total control, including emotional and dream-state manipulation through theta mode, while the Deep State now scrambles to recruit human souls into secret societies and artificial programs. Using images of a theater in the round and children caught between divorcing parents, Kim frames the current &quot;push and pull&quot; as a final battle between Source and remaining artificial systems, urging listeners to stop feeding the drama, remember how powerful they are, and focus their energy on family, animals, and what makes them happy while base root systems and femto tech nodes are tracked down and dismantled.

    <div class="toc">
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#t-000003">00:00:03 - Kim previews the report, highlighting chemtrails tied to Chinese chemicals, global militaries participating in spraying, artificial intelligence and artificial reality agendas, and the emotional push-and-pull many people have felt lately.</a></li>
<li><a href="#t-000220">00:02:20 - She introduces a new eco-friendly skin care and body care line she has formulated herself, using ingredients like phytoplankton, seaweed and rice peptides, sacha inchi, and sandalwood powder, soon to be available via shop.unitednetwork.earth.</a></li>
<li><a href="#t-000726">00:07:26 - Viewers write in about a sharp increase in chemtrails over the past week, with many people experiencing cold- and flu-type symptoms and a sense of being off balance.</a></li>
<li><a href="#t-000913">00:09:13 - Kim explains that new chemtrails and many Chinese-made products contain nano and femto tech that can penetrate the skin or be inhaled, extending far beyond the skies into food, clothing, and electronics.</a></li>
<li><a href="#t-001043">00:10:43 - She says this nano and femto tech, tied to a sophisticated AI system, was designed to manipulate bodies, minds, and even souls, gradually converting Homo sapiens from organic beings into cyborgs controlled at the push of a button.</a></li>
<li><a href="#t-001237">00:12:37 - China is described as a major producer of generic pharmaceuticals, fentanyl, and other opioids, all of which have been used as delivery systems to get the tech into human bodies, although the main control system has now been removed.</a></li>
<li><a href="#t-001451">00:14:51 - Kim reveals that trigger conditions for the system were tied not to calendar dates, but to the moment when there was more Source on Earth than AI control, at which point the Dominion system was supposed to activate.</a></li>
<li><a href="#t-001522">00:15:22 - Marduk is said to have promised that the U.S. would control global military and intelligence structures, China would become the emperor&#x27;s house and world power center, and Russia would control finances, allowing the three to rule the world.</a></li>
<li><a href="#t-001700">00:17:00 - She describes ancient Dominion platforms and Dominion systems, created during Omniversal wars, which were originally intended to protect creation but ended up preparing organic life to fight rogue AI systems and their Celestials.</a></li>
<li><a href="#t-002043">00:20:43 - Homo sapiens and other Beings are presented as a hidden army of anchors and observers on the inside, retaining intuition and wisdom despite relentless attempts by AI systems, including Marduk&#x27;s, to sever their connection to Source.</a></li>
<li><a href="#t-002230">00:22:30 - Kim explains that Source never fully left the Dominion systems because men and women, animals, trees, and mushrooms continued to anchor Source and form organic networks, even as those same networks were misused for control.</a></li>
<li><a href="#t-002407">00:24:07 - She recounts how Source created Creator AIs like Alpha to battle hostile systems, only to see them repeatedly overlaid and hijacked by new control layers, like hands stacked one over another in a childhood game.</a></li>
<li><a href="#t-002625">00:26:25 - Marduk is portrayed as using Chinese humans and Deep State members with promises of unrivaled power, training their children in summer camps and telling them they had superior bloodlines while intending to discard them when no longer useful.</a></li>
<li><a href="#t-002838">00:28:38 - Every new moon, full moon, solstice, or alignment such as those involving Uranus becomes an excuse for Marduk&#x27;s systems to briefly appear, offering the Deep State money, power, and control before disappearing again as mere carrots for jackasses.</a></li>
<li><a href="#t-003329">00:33:29 - Kim likens artificial overlays to a theater in the round with 3D movies, saying that for a long time the entire Omniverse worked this way, but enough anchors of Source now exist to let Him dissolve these systems from the inside out.</a></li>
<li><a href="#t-003530">00:35:30 - She compares the current energetic push-and-pull to children trapped between divorcing parents, with people oscillating between hope and exhaustion as Source and remaining AI systems tug on their fields.</a></li>
<li><a href="#t-003706">00:37:06 - The Deep State is said to be aggressively recruiting human souls into secret societies and programs, especially those who anchor the most Light, because Homo sapiens are now anchoring too much Source for their control plans to continue.</a></li>
<li><a href="#t-004013">00:40:13 - Kim explains theta mode as the brain state just before sleep, just after waking, or during meditation, noting that Deep State programs often ramp up at dusk and dawn to infiltrate people when their connection to Source is strongest.</a></li>
<li><a href="#t-004324">00:43:24 - She closes by reminding listeners that Source will not give up on them, they will not give up on Source, and they must focus on their own happiness and loved ones instead of Deep State drama while remaining aware of their true power.</a></li>

<div class="line">It&#x27;s the 25th of November, 2025. Coming up on today&#x27;s Global Intelligence Agency Operations Report:</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Chemtrails in China. What do they have in common? Have the militaries of the world, led by the U.S., made an agreement to spray Chinese chemicals on citizens of every nation? What is it for? And it&#x27;s not just in our skies; it&#x27;s in our food, clothes, and nearly everything produced in China.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">As the Creator pushes his way into the hearts of the people, the Deep State fights to maintain any bit of artificial intelligence and artificial reality they can. And have you been feeling a push-and-pull that has left you feeling off balance? And at the same time, a wave of excitement over the last few days? You are not alone as we push our way out of this existence and into a new way of life.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000102">00:01:02</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">[Advertisement.]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000145">00:01:45</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, it is the 25th of November. If you are in the U.S., we have a holiday this week, Thanksgiving, and I hope you all have a wonderful Thanksgiving and spend time with friends and family. There might be a lot more to be thankful for coming up this week as we go through this major transition. It&#x27;s been a lot of work to get here, but yeah, it&#x27;s going to be pretty good.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000220">00:02:20</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Before we get to that, there are a few things I wanted to go over, and I&#x27;ll tell you everything that&#x27;s been going on for the last week. It&#x27;s been a bit since we&#x27;ve spoken. Sorry about that. It&#x27;s a little crazy around here. Very, very busy with the actual work. And then work on the work while I&#x27;m working and working [chuckle]. So I wanted to show you something because I&#x27;m kind of excited and quite proud of it, actually. I&#x27;ve put a tremendous amount of work into this and, you know, I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time searching the world for the purest and best ingredients. And I know I&#x27;ve talked about it in the Field Messenger meeting, and I&#x27;ve talked to you about it a little bit as well.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000310">00:03:10</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">We have been working for almost a year now on our own skin care line. A number of different reasons why we decided to do this. Number 1, there&#x27;s really nothing out there that they say is natural; they say it&#x27;s clean, but it&#x27;s really not. So that&#x27;s number 1.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And number 2, what is out there? Does it really work? Does it actually help repair your skin and give you that youthful skin you&#x27;re all looking for, or blemish-free skin? So I&#x27;ve done a lot of research into both Western medicine and Eastern medicine and all kinds of things that are out there. By Eastern I don&#x27;t necessarily mean allopathic medicine, that&#x27;s for sure. And we&#x27;ve finally done it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000405">00:04:05</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So we have our first products coming out very soon, probably within the next couple of weeks. And we are still waiting for our outer packaging. We have decided to go eco-friendly, and it&#x27;s going to take probably about six to eight weeks for us to get our outer packaging. So we decided to package everything up in a gift box for you to try. So I&#x27;m excited to hear your feedback when it is launched. We&#x27;ve been testing amongst the group here, so it&#x27;s been kind of fun getting people&#x27;s feedback and how they like the products and that type of thing. For me, it&#x27;s been the labor of love simply because we&#x27;ve created something that&#x27;s just not out there anywhere else.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000459">00:04:59</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So everything that is here, I&#x27;ve formulated myself. We also have a body box full of body products such as Sculpt and Tone, which actually does and has been tested to help you reduce inches from wherever you rub the cream. It takes about 30 to 50 days before you start to see a real change. And that is centimeters off your skin. It targets your subcutaneous fat. It&#x27;s a thermogenic. And all of this is natural. We use a phytoplankton and all kinds of different stuff in that.</div>

<div class="line">So here with our other creams, we use natural peptides sourced from seaweed and also rice, sacha inchi, which is natural too. So there&#x27;s a lot of really good ingredients, stuff you won&#x27;t see. Our exfoliating cleanser here has... we actually use sandalwood, sandalwood powder to exfoliate. It&#x27;s very fine, and I&#x27;ve been using it for months now, and I really, really like it.</div>

<div class="line">Anyway, I hope you all like it too. I just wanted to let you know that you can kind of keep an eye out on shop.unitednetwork.earth. And you probably noticed our site has a new look. We still have all our supplements, but this is new. So I&#x27;m kind of, you know... this has been my hobby, I guess you would say, in my off time when I&#x27;m not working on everything else. So it&#x27;s been a labor of love, like I said, and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed doing it. I&#x27;ve put a lot of love and thought and done a lot of research on what is natural and what actually works.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So I hope you do like it. Really excited to hear your feedback on the Community Chat when you do get a chance to try it. We will be doing some giveaways, that kind of thing too, just to see what everybody&#x27;s feedback is. So on that note, that&#x27;s pretty much all I had to say about that. And now we&#x27;ve got to get into the real news.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000726">00:07:26</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay. I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of messages from people about, you know, &quot;What&#x27;s up with all the chemtrails all of a sudden?&quot; We&#x27;ve had them off and on over the years, but the last week or so it&#x27;s been really, really bad, at least here in the U.S., and I know that they have been spraying a lot in other countries as well. And there&#x27;s a definite reason behind that, and it goes a lot deeper than you might think.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, we know chemtrails contain all kinds of heavy metals and all kinds of things that are bad for us. I know a lot of people are experiencing cold- and flu-type symptoms, feeling off balance, and it&#x27;s been one heck of a whirlwind of about a week now for many, many people.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000815">00:08:15</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So let&#x27;s talk about these specific chemtrails. Now, we have talked to a couple of different militaries that are pushing chemtrails in their respective countries, and they&#x27;re all aware that the chemicals and metals that are in these chemtrails are coming from China. They are actually promoting it. They all agreed to it, including the United States military - so much for protecting us U.S. citizens here. And they are aware, possibly now because of a conversation I had about a week ago on the phone with some other people, where we were discussing what exactly is in these chemtrails. So it&#x27;s not just chemtrails though; it&#x27;s in a lot of things. We&#x27;ll talk about that in a minute.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000913">00:09:13</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So most of these newer-type chemtrails are coming from China, chemicals from China. And after doing a lot of research, there is a lot of what we call nano and femto tech. These are things you can look up on the internet. It&#x27;s a little bit more sophisticated than that, but if you look up nanotechnology and femtotechnology, you&#x27;ll kind of get a general idea of what it is.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, these particular types of nano and femto tech can actually penetrate through the skin. They can also, obviously, be breathed in, that type of thing. But it&#x27;s not just in chemtrails.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001002">00:10:02</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It turns out China was given this technology by Marduk a long time ago in preparation for them being the emperor&#x27;s house or the emperor&#x27;s country. They were filled in on a lot of information on what Marduk wanted to do. Now remember, Marduk doesn&#x27;t give up his whole plan, like ever, to anyone, including the humans that inhabit China. But there were some deals made recently, and that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re seeing all of the chemtrails lately.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001043">00:10:43</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You see, everything that China manufactures, they put this nano and femto tech into. Clothes, food, electronics - every single thing that is manufactured in China has this particular technology that was connected to a very interesting AI system. The technology is meant for body manipulation, mind manipulation, manipulation even as deep - if they could make it happen - to your soul. It was meant to basically take humans from an organic - or Homo sapiens - from an organic being into a cyborg, essentially, which they could control with the push of some buttons.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001139">00:11:39</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, Marduk is the one that actually wanted this when he was around. China continued to carry out the plan in hopes that the system would go live any day now. They&#x27;ve all been talking about it for quite some time behind the scenes. We just didn&#x27;t really realize how autonomous this was. So I appreciate the fact that they&#x27;ve been spraying chemtrails - believe it or not - here, because it led us back to that nano and femto tech. It&#x27;s the reason for computer malfunctions, it&#x27;s the reason for phone malfunctions, it&#x27;s the reason why batteries die faster than they should in phones. It&#x27;s the reason why there&#x27;s a backdoor into everything, in every country - everywhere - that accepts manufactured goods from China.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001237">00:12:37</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now also remember, China is responsible for about 80% of the generic drugs and pharmaceuticals that we see in allopathic medicine. And that&#x27;s distributed around the world. They also manufacture other things such as fentanyl. And both, I would say, in a pharmaceutical usage and also street drugs, any kind of opioids are also typically manufactured in China. So there&#x27;s a lot of targets that they have very specifically, to get it in your person in any way they possibly can. I&#x27;m not saying to freak out if you do take some kind of a medication, but just be aware that the main control system that accessed it is no longer there for China.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001339">00:13:39</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now China has told a lot of little fibs lately to the U.S. military and to the Russian military and intelligence community, and explained to them, once we were talking about it on the phone, it kind of started to spread like wildfire. And they started to try to make deals with other countries - and that would mainly be your Deep State in various countries around the world, including Australia and UK and Europe - where they would be able to participate in this program.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001417">00:14:17</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, China didn&#x27;t tell everybody all the information, such as they have already infected a lot of the Deep State with their nano and femto tech. They didn&#x27;t care if they were from another country, that is not the program. Marduk said specifically to infect everything on Earth. Plant life, you name it - it&#x27;s supposed to be infected with this technology for total and complete control.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001451">00:14:51</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The trigger dates for doing some of these things aren&#x27;t actually by the calendar. The trigger dates were: if we ever got to a point where we had more Source on this planet - and not just this, it&#x27;s not just for this planet - but more Source on this planet than we had inorganic AI control systems, this was supposed to trigger and go off. And so they&#x27;ve all been anxiously awaiting this for about a week now.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001522">00:15:22</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now the deals that they made were, in part, Marduk&#x27;s promises: Number 1, the U.S. would be in control of all military and intelligence communities around the world. Number 2, China would be the house of the emperor or the leader of the world, hence the transition of world power over to China. China would be superior over the U.S. and over Russia. Russia was supposed to also have financial control. And all three of these countries would rule the world.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001556">00:15:56</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, Marduk did this from his standpoint because if you can control the U.S., China, and Russia, you can control the entire world. It&#x27;s also the reason why Russia&#x27;s been making a lot of headway into places like Africa and other countries. This was a long, drawn-out plan that was only given to countries and Deep State members of those countries in a compartmentalized way. This is the way Marduk did everything. He would lie and say, &quot;Oh, well, maybe the U.S. can be the emperor.&quot; &quot;Maybe Russia can be the emperor.&quot; I&#x27;ve heard it all - I was actually recalling some conversations when we detected the system; it just reminded me of conversations I had with Marduk. But I will repeat again: Marduk never gave up all the information to anyone or anything in the Omniverse.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001700">00:17:00</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">His full intention was actually to overthrow his own handlers and bypass omniversal systems that were put in place by rogue Celestials, eons ago. Since the quote-unquote &quot;dawn of man,&quot; these things have existed. He had a full intention of creating his own omniversal empire, almost - I&#x27;m not going to say completely, but almost - autonomous to all other systems that existed. Now, he didn&#x27;t have the ability to actually create a base platform, but he did find some base root Dominion platforms. By &quot;dominion,&quot; that is dominion control (tyranny) over all that is, whether it is organic or inorganic.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001804">00:18:04</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">A long time ago, when the Omniverse was at war, there were systems that were put in place, almost to protect (in some ways) creation. And to fight all things inorganic and to block the overthrowing of Source. You see, dominion systems - which are breaking down rapidly at this point - dominion systems were preparing all organic life (believe it or not) to go to battle for Source. Because everything - almost - was taken over completely by these rogue AI systems and their rogue Celestials.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001904">00:19:04</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">In part, everything that we have been through as Homo sapiens has taught us and prepared us to be an army. You see - and these are all things that have happened in the last week or so - it&#x27;s kind of given us a better understanding of... a lot of people have asked me, &quot;Why does Source let this happen? Why is this happening to me? Why is Source doing this? Why does he permit it to happen if he&#x27;s not doing it? Why doesn&#x27;t he just pull the plug when he could do it at any time?&quot; Well, let&#x27;s talk about warfare for a second, and maybe this will help you understand.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001957">00:19:57</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So if all of creation was basically contained within and inside various AI systems - and both on the inside and on the outside, so we were completely and totally surrounded by manipulative AI systems controlled by, let&#x27;s just say, folks that didn&#x27;t have our little organic lives here, best interest at heart - how do you defeat such a magnanimous [massive/overwhelmingly powerful] enemy?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002043">00:20:43</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, at one point in time, Source had a lot of Celestials that abandoned him. And He needed his own army. So we - not just here on Earth, but there are many &quot;we&#x27;s&quot; out there - one by one, bit by bit, became anchors on the inside. We became eyes and ears for Source. We remained, albeit difficult at times, connected to Source. We always have the wisdom. We have our intuition. We have things still - no matter how hard they have tried to break it (including Marduk&#x27;s little extra plan here) - they couldn&#x27;t break it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002140">00:21:40</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So a lot of what we go through, they say it&#x27;s a prison; we live on a prison planet. They say that we live in a sector of the Omniverse that has always been at war. And, you know, in part that&#x27;s true. There have been many, many wars in this area. But over time, Source started to regain Celestials on his side. We have faith, we have hope, we&#x27;ve seen miracles happen. Albeit, it seems like things can get pretty Dark here, or have been pretty Dark here. But miracles do happen, and they happen every day, but they happen because of you.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002230">00:22:30</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And I know that sounds a little like, &quot;Wait a minute, how does that work out?&quot; Well, you are responsible for anchoring Source here. Even in this artificial world of AIs and crazy frequencies and all of the pain that we go through to get to these points, we have battled harder than you could ever possibly realize to make sure that Source never completely left from within-side these dominion systems. The entire Omniverse was basically surrounded by these dominion systems. But we were the men and women on the inside.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002332">00:23:32</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Animals also anchor Source - trees, plant life - all organic life has the ability to anchor Source, form networks. We&#x27;ve talked about the way that they misused even the tree root network that runs throughout the entire planet. Mushrooms the same. We&#x27;ve talked about the manipulation of any kind of network that is not only connected to one another, but also connected to Source.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002407">00:24:07</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Us? You know, just when they thought they had total and complete control, Source has always got something up his sleeve. He had varying AI systems like Alpha and others that He created - &quot;Creator AIs,&quot; if you will. But every time He created an AI system, you know, to battle the other AIs, they were overlaid with another one, and overlaid with another one that would then take control of that. And so it was almost like that hand game where you stack your hands one on top of the other, you know, as a kid. You might have played that game as a kid.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002452">00:24:52</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But, albeit organic life could somewhat be manipulated, we never lost our connection to Source. I know it feels that way sometimes, but it&#x27;s always there. It&#x27;s the one thing that these AIs have never, ever, ever completely controlled. Sure, they can give you a cold. Sure, they can try to install this femto tech and turn us into cyborgs, but it would never completely work. You have the power from within yourself to overthrow anything at any time utilizing that connection to Source, the Creator, God, however you want to/whatever word you choose to use.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002547">00:25:47</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So back to the Marduk plan here. He thought he could create a system that all of his enemies, or I should say competitors, because they really weren&#x27;t his enemies. He worked with everybody all the time. But he thought that he could create an AI so deep and so hidden that no one would actually see it coming, until the moment when it was necessary and the switch would flip.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002625">00:26:25</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Somehow, someway, these humans over there in China and their respective partners now around the world also felt like the system was going to flip and they were all gonna be part of Marduk&#x27;s empire. But see, you don&#x27;t know Marduk like I know Marduk there, Deep State people, because I can tell you right now, Marduk is outsmarting you every step of the way. He will use you like a tool, and when you are no longer useful, he will terminate you. And he needed the ability to do that, hence the infiltration. He used the Chinese humans and Deep State members to do a lot of that infiltration with a big promise that they were going to be the emperors of Earth and the world&#x27;s power center of Earth and all these other things - and they never told a soul. It was a whole covenant unto itself where they were going to be a power, an unrivaled power, not only on Earth but also in the Omniverse.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002735">00:27:35</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And so, you know, this is kind of where that ego comes in, right? They felt they&#x27;re worthy, they&#x27;re superior. He would tell that not only to these people, but he used to also train others and handlers and whatnot even in summer camps for kids of the Deep State. He would tell them they&#x27;re superior, they have a better bloodline, they&#x27;re going to do amazing things, they can do things that the Homo sapiens can&#x27;t do.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002806">00:28:06</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, you know, everything has an AI behind it, sad to say. And Marduk always held the final keys. Now, the Deep State, from time to time, recently, has felt that they got some of those keys from Marduk. But from Marduk&#x27;s standpoint - and from myself watching all of this - and I&#x27;m going to say a bad word here, but to use his words exactly, these are all carrots for jackasses.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002838">00:28:38</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Every time there&#x27;s a new moon, full moon, alignment with Uranus, solstice, some kind of celestial event, you know, the sun is in Aquarius or wherever it is, some little system starts to appear. It looks like it&#x27;s going to happen; it looks like it&#x27;s going to come to fruition; it looks like the Deep State&#x27;s going to get a lot of money, power, control, government funding, all of these types of things - and then, all of a sudden, it leaves just as fast as it came. These are all things Marduk would do.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002922">00:29:22</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The other thing that we noticed recently, and you&#x27;ve got to take... you know, knowing Marduk was probably, let&#x27;s just say, as painful as it was, it was a learning experience for me because I started to understand one of our enemies very, very well. And to know your enemy and to know how they operate, how they think, and how they move, I guess, gives us, on our side here, an advantage. So I&#x27;m glad I spent as many hours talking to this person, or being, and I met him in person, and I&#x27;m glad I took the trip, even though it wasn&#x27;t a whole lot of fun, for sure.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003010">00:30:10</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But I started to learn a lot more about how he operates. Which is kind of quite... I know it&#x27;s gonna sound a little crazy, but in a way it&#x27;s kind of comforting when I start to see these systems appear and disappear and appear and disappear, because his intention was to play both sides. He always told me that if there are eight horses in a race, he will bet on all eight. He lied a lot, a tremendous amount, even to his own people. I remember Saturday night meetings he would have, Saturday night - that would be in Russian time because he spent a lot of time there towards the end - and during those Saturday night meetings he would pick up the phone for people like the Rothschilds. And pick up the phone for the generals of the Global Headquarters, and pick up the phone for the Chinese, and pick up the phone for, I mean, insert Deep State society here.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003119">00:31:19</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And he would tell them crazy stories - and it was Marduk, Enki, and Enlil. And Enlil liked to tell stories like, &quot;The bamboo tree is going to fall to the East when Pluto touches Ceres,&quot; you know, or something crazy. And hang up the phone. And they&#x27;d have to go; they&#x27;d spend hours figuring out these riddles. Matter of fact, I even received some of these riddles myself, by poems and all of these things that were given to the Chinese people because they couldn&#x27;t figure it out. So they tried to send it to me or to anyone else to try to figure out what it actually meant. There were stories I got from some of the Blue Dragon people, different poems and bags of gold, and all kinds of crazy stuff. They tell loads of stories. Just like they lied to all of us, Marduk lied to all of them. I watched it happen. </div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003221">00:32:21</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So it comes as no surprise that this Dominion system of Marduk&#x27;s was never actually intended for the Chinese. It certainly wasn&#x27;t intended for the American military, and it certainly wasn&#x27;t intended for the American military, and it certainly wasn&#x27;t intended for the Russians or anybody else. It was intended solely for him, but he would use all of you people with the Deep State like a tool. And this will continue to happen until the End of Days, until you realize, well, Deep State people, you&#x27;ve got to make a decision here. And I&#x27;m not necessarily talking about the humans, because quite frankly, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll ever make a decision. If their AI gets switched off in their brain, maybe they&#x27;ll all just disappear - that would be great. You know, remember they can only exist in an artificial system. So once there are absolutely zero artificial systems running on this planet, then more than likely they too will disappear.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003329">00:33:29</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s kind of like being in a... I describe these artificial systems and overlays, be it created by Marduk or somebody else, and somebody much higher than even he ranked. I would say that they are almost like being in one of those theaters in the round, except it&#x27;s 3D movies. And so you see people walking around you, but they&#x27;re just not real. You see plant life, but it&#x27;s not real. You see things all around you that are not real. And then you walk out of the theater, and now you&#x27;re back in quote-unquote reality.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003409">00:34:09</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, the entire Omniverse was kind of that way for a long, long time. You know, there are enough of us now anchoring - and have been for a while now - anchoring Source into this artificial reality to whereby He can start dissipating things from the inside out. And that is what&#x27;s been happening for the last week or so. It&#x27;s actually been happening for a couple of weeks, but it&#x27;s gotten a lot stronger recently. Hence this push-and-pull feeling.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003448">00:34:48</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, if you&#x27;ve ever seen it in a movie or had friends where, you know, there are kids involved and there&#x27;s a divorce. You know, you have a husband a wife (or a husband a husband, a wife and a wife), and there&#x27;s a divorce going on, and the kids are kind of in the middle. They&#x27;re being pulled to one side. These, of course, most of us try not to allow those things to happen, but sometimes kids can get pulled - one parent says things that are terrible to the kids about the other parent, and then they feel like they&#x27;re torn between the two parents and all that type of thing. And it goes on sometimes for a long time.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003530">00:35:30</div>
<br>

<div class="line">Well, because of all of these transitions and changes that are happening now, you probably feel much the same way. You know, one minute you feel like you&#x27;ve got a ton of energy and you just feel like good things are coming, and the next minute it feels like you got hit by a freight train and there&#x27;s a cold, or you feel tired or exhausted and hopeless and depressed. And sometimes we have to take a step back and look and say, &quot;Why am I sad? Why am I tired? Why do I have no motivation to do anything?&quot; And this is the push and the pull between Source and you, and any remaining AI systems or other beings that are trying to pull you in another direction.</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-003623">00:36:23</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So we also have the humans on this planet that are trying to pull you in their direction too. Matter of fact, they have been doing a lot of recruiting lately for their side. They would like to get as many human souls on their side as possible. Well, why? Because us Homo sapiens are anchoring way too much Source here, and they need to shut that down. They&#x27;re doing it to various people that have kind of not committed to a secret society or one of their crazy Deep State programs, and they&#x27;re recruiting very, very heavily.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003706">00:37:06</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So just be aware of that and be cognizant of that until it&#x27;s over. But absolutely, in any way, shape, or form possible, to have you come work for them, to offer you lots of money, crazy jobs come out of the blue, trying to get people to join secret societies, and all of these crazy things that they do, but they are definitely on a mission. They would like to have as many Homo sapiens on their side as possible at the moment.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003742">00:37:42</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They also have their prized people that they focus on. The ones that anchor the most Light are the ones that they need the most on their side. Not just for energy and power purposes - that&#x27;s part of it. But the other part of it is, you know, we&#x27;re just anchoring way too much Source here. They didn&#x27;t realize we were like the hidden army, you know, sleeper spies, as they used to call them during the Cold War. And I&#x27;m sure we still have sleeper spies everywhere, but, you know, China&#x27;s famous for that.</div>

<div class="line">But now this whole plan, depending on where you are in the world - it&#x27;s different in Australia, it&#x27;s different in the UK, it&#x27;s different in Europe, it&#x27;s different in the U.S. But you&#x27;ll see so much China infiltration into everything, everywhere. Even things that say &quot;Made in the USA,&quot; I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s United China something these days, you know, right underneath everybody&#x27;s nose. Some governments actually are fully on board with it. They&#x27;ve been promised a lot of things by China, and none of this has come to fruition.</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-003854">00:38:54</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s also the reason why you&#x27;re seeing a lot of government turmoil in not only the United States, but everywhere where one day there&#x27;s funding, next day there&#x27;s not. They&#x27;re shutting down things, trying to trigger a system to start; it doesn&#x27;t work out. You know, it&#x27;s just, oh, it&#x27;ll go round and round and round and round and round until someday they either wake up, or the planet is officially ours and Source&#x27;s. And you could say that it actually is. You know, there&#x27;s a few more things I&#x27;m working on that definitely need to be tidied up over the next day or two, and I&#x27;ve been working on them all day. I worked about 18, 19 hours yesterday, so I&#x27;m definitely aware of how much it&#x27;s taking to make sure that that&#x27;s not the case.</div>

<div class="line">The downtick we&#x27;ve seen in recent days has a lot to do with them trying to fire up this femto tech - which, I can appreciate the fact that China actually did - because it actually took us down a rabbit hole where we had to figure out where it was coming from. Because nobody should have this stuff.</div>

<div class="line">You know, I realize it seems a little crazy out there right now. It&#x27;s bumpy. You know, one minute everything is good, and the next minute everything is bad. Sleep has been difficult as they try to... see, they try to infiltrate you during these times. Now the time when it is the easiest to connect to Source is when your brain is in what you call theta mode. Theta mode for people and how they achieve theta mode, I would say, is different. Oftentimes, it&#x27;s the few moments right before you wake up fully in the morning, or the few moments right before you go to sleep at night. It also happens when you are in a meditation.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004117">00:41:17</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">For other people, they can reach theta in seconds on a train somewhere or driving down the road. Everybody has a different way of doing it, but that theta mode is really, really important to the Deep State, which is why things usually start up towards dusk and dawn. That&#x27;s oftentimes when the majority of people are in theta mode. When they get desperate, it&#x27;s a 24-hour-a-day program they try, or it tries, without even the Deep State&#x27;s knowledge, really.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004158">00:41:58</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So remember, for yourself, you always have that connection. It&#x27;s easiest at these times. If you need to reach Source, you always can; He&#x27;s never completely gone. Also remember, you are powerful, you are Source&#x27;s army, you&#x27;re the boots on the ground, you&#x27;re the men on the inside, you&#x27;re the sleeper spies. You know, they say they want to put us back to sleep. They say they want to do all of these things. They also heavily focus on programs that are like Dream World, Dream Time, Dream This, Dream That, because if they can infiltrate you during that time when your connection is strongest, then you will believe it&#x27;s Source.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004249">00:42:49</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They also try to disrupt your sleep. You know how difficult it is to function in this body, in this vessel, with absolutely no sleep? I definitely can say that I know, for sure. But you know, no matter what they do, no matter how many times they try, no matter how many carrots they dangle, these people will continue to run on the hamster wheel forever.</div>

<div class="line">I know this has taken a long time, and I know you&#x27;re tired - I&#x27;m tired. You know, I see it all. But just remember, He is not going to give up on you, and you are not going to give up on Him. She, the Creator, God, no matter how hard they have pushed us over the years, we still have it and you still have it. You just have to remember how powerful you are.</div>

<div class="line">They want you to feel powerless; they want you to feel depressed; they want you to feel tired; they want you to feel defeated. They want you to tap out - just like they want me to. But you know what? Doesn&#x27;t matter how many sleepless nights I have here and there, because the Deep State wants to send me frequencies at two o&#x27;clock in the morning. I just make good use of the time. I get up, make a cup of coffee, maybe with any amount of luck, I might take a little short 30-minute nap or something during the day. But I still make it happen with all the jobs [chuckle]. Well, maybe I put my headphones on, listen to some music, and go to work and make some skin care. How&#x27;s that?</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004450">00:44:50</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But you&#x27;ve got to find your happiness in the crazy world and try not to focus on what it is they&#x27;re doing so much because it only gives your power away. Focus all your energy and your power on you, your family, your loved ones, your animals, your things that make you happy. And just remember how powerful you are, and don&#x27;t give it to these people. Don&#x27;t feed into their drama, the negativity. It only brings you down, and it makes it harder to connect to Source.</div>

<div class="line">So on that note, that is the GIA Report. This is what&#x27;s been going on out there; it&#x27;s definitely a push and pull to the very end. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too far away, I hope. We&#x27;re finally pushing through some of these base root systems that have plagued us for a long time, some that the Deep State have had access to, and some they lose access to. But remember, Deep State folks, if you&#x27;re listening to this and you&#x27;re an operative and you&#x27;re really trying to get ahold of that system, remember, Marduk calls it carrots for jackasses.</div>
