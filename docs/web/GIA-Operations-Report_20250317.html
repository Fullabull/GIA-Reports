<div class="timestamp" id="t-000000">00:00:00</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s the 17th of March, 2025. Coming up on today&#x27;s Global Intelligence Agency Operations Report:</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Elon Musk&#x27;s DOGE Department claims the U.S. government has money-magic machines that just spit out payments - and the DOGE department has full access. But is this true?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And Happy New Year! Nope, you heard me right. This past full moon marks the beginning of the new year. But this year it was so much more than just that.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And hundreds of contractors try to build the ultimate crypto platform for Trump.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But is it possible? Perhaps no one has ever heard of open-source coding.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000046">00:00:46</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, it&#x27;s the 17th of March and Happy St. Patrick&#x27;s Day, if that&#x27;s something you&#x27;re celebrating. I think I&#x27;m going to pass on the green beer and keep my green water. I drink ChlorOxygen water a lot, which is green and kind of minty, so it&#x27;s really good.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Anyway, let&#x27;s talk about what&#x27;s going on in the world. We&#x27;ve got a lot of stuff that&#x27;s been happening over the weekend, and I&#x27;m gonna explain that to you. And there&#x27;s been a lot of questions as to some of the things that the Deep State is up to. So, we&#x27;re going to start with something called &quot;money-magic computers.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000124">00:01:24</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Lately Elon Musk has been talking about &quot;money-magic computers&quot; that just spit out payments. So take a look:</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000132">00:01:32</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Ted Cruz: One of the things you told me about is what you call magic-money computers. Tell us about it because I&#x27;ve never heard of that until you brought that up.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Elon Musk: Okay, so you may think that these government computers like all talk to each other, they synchronize, they add up what funds are going somewhere, and it&#x27;s coherent. And that the numbers, for example, that you&#x27;re presented as a senator are actually the real numbers.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Ted Cruz: One would think.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Elon Musk: One would think, they&#x27;re not.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Ted Cruz: Yeah.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Elon Musk: Okay. I mean, they&#x27;re not totally wrong, but they&#x27;re probably off by 5% or 10% in some cases. So I call it &quot;magic money computer&quot; - any computer which can just make money out of thin air. That&#x27;s magic money.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Ted Cruz: So how does that work?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Elon Musk: It just issues payments.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Ted Cruz: And you said there&#x27;s something like 11 of these computers at Treasury that are sending out trillions in payments?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Elon Musk: They&#x27;re mostly at Treasury. Some are at HHS, some at, there&#x27;s one or two at State, there&#x27;s some at DOD. I think we&#x27;ve found now 14 magic-money computers.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Ted Cruz: 14, okay.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Elon Musk: They just send money out of nothing.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000250">00:02:50</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I bet all of you are thinking, &quot;Gee, where do I get one of those money-magic computers?&quot; [giggle] I know I&#x27;d like to get one, but not like theirs.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, it turns out, the Trump operatives are having a really difficult time holding up the narrative. And it&#x27;s not just in the U.S. - it&#x27;s everywhere. They&#x27;ve got terrorist organizations to pay, wars to start, you know, their typical business. So over the last couple of days they&#x27;ve convinced the - let&#x27;s just say their debtors, people they owe a lot of money to - that they have money-magic computers. And that&#x27;s the whole purpose of that interview: to announce the fact they have a way to make payments - unlimited payments - to anyone they want to.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000339">00:03:39</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But is that really the truth? Well, let&#x27;s just say, &quot;No.&quot; First of all, the servers and computers that they&#x27;re trying to operate are fraudulent - but you know, they are the U.S. government, so that&#x27;s no surprise.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They were, the servers were actually located at the Bank of Ireland, in Ireland. They do not function. I know they gave 14 or set up 14 of these computers - probably more. I think there&#x27;s more like about 20 or 21 computers that have been set up that were connected to this server.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000417">00:04:17</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Is the server in U.S. dollars? Or was it in U.S. dollars? The answer to the question is &quot;No.&quot; It was in cryptocurrency, probably some fantasy dollar.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So now we have fantasy crypto that allegedly was going to pay all of the U.S. government&#x27;s bills to all of its debtors, including the Houthis in Yemen and the Israelis and of course the Iranians, and everybody got all excited that they were going to get payments. And so there&#x27;s been quite an uptick over the weekend of let&#x27;s just say, warfare, in the Middle East.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Because of course, they always overstep their bounds. They make up stories and say that this money is going to be good.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But this money never was good. They did try to run a couple of tests over the weekend to see if they could transfer this money into the banking system - it was rejected - their server isn&#x27;t fully running anyway.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But, you know, there&#x27;s always hope, and so they give people hope so that they will continue warfare and killing people in the name of the Deep State - known as the Trump administration.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000532">00:05:32</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, if you are listening to this, and you are waiting for your payment from the Money-Magic Computer System, yeah, you&#x27;re going to be waiting an awful long time - like probably an eon or more - for that to actually happen. So, just another lie from a group of people that - all they do is lie. They&#x27;re trained to lie. They just lie. That&#x27;s it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000556">00:05:56</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">There are all of these hyped-up videos from over the weekend that have been circulating around the internet of Trump watching the assault on the Yemeni Houthis in real time. You know, they know it was the Iranians. Well, unless Iranian stands for &quot;Irrational, Retarded Administration of the United States Network,&quot; then no, it wasn&#x27;t the Iranians in any way that were bombing Yemen. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d love to get the Iranians involved so they can start World War III in the Middle East.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And the Middle East is a big territory for these people. For some reason - even though there are no more portals there, there are no more things that they would want to acquire or take a hold of - they still are hell-bent on starting World War III in the Middle East.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Again, it&#x27;s all about territory for these people, and they haven&#x27;t quite yet realized that that territory isn&#x27;t something that they want.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000707">00:07:07</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But there was, well, let&#x27;s just say some issues that occurred over the weekend as well. So I did say, in the coming up, that it is New Year&#x27;s - and it is. So for those people - and we know who you are, and that&#x27;s probably not you - they mark New Year&#x27;s Day in accordance with the lunar calendar, which is the full moon that occurs within what we call &quot;equinox time&quot; every year. So we have been in equinox time for a while. We are only a few days away from the actual equinox - I think it&#x27;s three days away from now. So, the full moon at the end of last week marked the new year for these people.</div>

<div class="line">Now, this one - due to the moment of silence in the heavens, so to speak, that occurred prior to that - they believed that they were on track for a very large change and, well, let&#x27;s just say, in our world that would be more like &quot;Judgment Day.&quot; It would be a time of paying of debts, especially on the Saturday - the Ides of March, the 15th of March - that would follow, which was definitely an interesting day to say the least.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And this would have been a time when a computer system called ARC would have turned on - and yet it did.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000850">00:08:50</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, ARC was an omniversal or multi-universal system. It was run by what you would call both angels and demons, and it had a lot to do with judgment - debt calling in. And so it did. It began doing that.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It also created a simulation - a matrix - which didn&#x27;t last very long. It lasted for about 24 hours - not even 24 hours - in which it would start to run simulations not only on Earth, but everywhere.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Allegedly, this is a time when people pay for their sins, so to speak, and are also rewarded for their virtues.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000945">00:09:45</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The system hadn&#x27;t been turned on - or hadn&#x27;t lit up, I guess you would say - in thousands of years, if not more than thousands of years. And it is tied directly to the Arcs of the Covenant - A-R-C - that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called ARC-AI.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">ARC is a Covenant between Source, Anti-Source, and what you would call Neutral Source, in which, let&#x27;s just say, it was meant to keep the Universe on track - and if need be, it was supposed to fire up the simulation to bring everything on track and everything back in balance.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Did the Deep State know truly what they were looking for? No. But that didn&#x27;t stop them from acquiring - over the last decade or so - all seven Arcs, and moving them over to the Kolyma Gulag in Russia. Because they thought that they could - all by themselves - renew this Covenant.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001051">00:10:51</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, it was never between anyone here on Earth, and it really had nothing to do with them, and I&#x27;m not sure who they were trying to reach out to. But nonetheless, no, it didn&#x27;t work.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I do know a person that was involved in this - let&#x27;s just call it &quot;giant mess&quot; - and I talked to that person quite a bit, actually, probably from the years of 2013 to 2017, I met that person, in person, in a couple of different countries. Let&#x27;s just say he&#x27;s someone that went off the rails in a lot of ways.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But this person is the one that took some information I had given him a long time ago and orchestrated this entire fiasco that&#x27;s been going on for a little over a week now - come to find out - that didn&#x27;t surface until over the weekend as well.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001200">00:12:00</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, the Covenant has officially expired, and there&#x27;s no need to have a simulated judgment, so to speak, and well, that&#x27;s another thing that went off the rails.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Were they expecting to get access to some kind of an AI because of an event they were expecting over the weekend? Yes. Did that happen? No.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, I&#x27;m guessing this whole Bank of Ireland scam was pretty much related to this particular situation. There are a few other things going on, though, that tells me they plan to continue the fake server or fake-it-till-you-make-it payment systems - money-magic systems, so to speak.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001252">00:12:52</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And I know the Rothschilds, and their... let&#x27;s just call them their... I was gonna say a bad word - so I&#x27;m not going to say that word. But there are people that work for them, such as the Trump administration. These people are really wanting their money-magic system back. They have also promised all of the banks - especially all the major banks in the U.S., UK, and in China - that they would have a new money-magic, unlimited-printing system up and running by today.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, now they&#x27;ve been told to just hold tight - it&#x27;s coming. They will have the ability to print unlimited money. And, of course, that unlimited-money check, so to speak, or payment system, would have been under the control of the DOGE department.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Oh, isn&#x27;t that lovely? Yeah, no, that didn&#x27;t happen. That&#x27;s not going to happen.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001401">00:14:01</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay, next. A few other things that I wanted to talk about, because there is a lot of bidding now. Now that they think they found the key - because we&#x27;ve never, ever seen a fake server before from these people. I mean, like, it&#x27;s never happened, right?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Of course it&#x27;s happened - it&#x27;s happened a thousand times. And whether they installed it at the Fed, the Treasury, the Bank of Ireland, the FedNow system, or in China at the Shanghai Exchange, or in Russia, or in India, or in Pakistan, or in - I mean, with, you know - the list goes on and on and on for the amount of times they have tried to install fake servers into the banking system.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001444">00:14:44</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, I hate to put it to these people in rather blunt terms, but in order to put money into a banking system, you need multiple types of allocation numbers, which are also co-coordinated in the past with the Association of Numerical Numbering Agencies.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, before that - maybe not before that - but that system was also connected to another AI system you and I call Alpha, in the past. After that system was disconnected from the banking system and our new Key Integrated Monetary System... let&#x27;s just say, counter - because I did explain in detail how the ANNA system worked.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001540">00:15:40</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">In brief, it basically calculates everything that you scan at every store in the entire world, simultaneously. So, it has that feature. Now, our Key Integrated Monetary System has that feature.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The reason why we kept that feature is because it will actually help us calculate supply and demand of things like food, toothbrushes, clothing - you know, so that we can make sure that we are meeting the demand and we do not have shortages, therefore causing unnecessary hyperinflation of goods - unlike BlackRock.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, sometimes a hammer can be used to build a house, and sometimes it can be used for really bad things, as you know. In this particular case, we kept it for that very reason.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001638">00:16:38</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, this brings us to the next problem that we&#x27;ve encountered recently with these people.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So the Trump administration is continuing to put out bids, so to speak - or contracts - being offered to people who build cryptocurrency platforms. Now, there was a particular bid that was won - quite a long time ago, a few months ago - to a company that could build a data center that they claimed could handle enough transactions to support the entire banking system of the world.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001720">00:17:20</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They have told them that it would take about $8 billion to build. They&#x27;ve also been told - the Trump administration has been told - that it would take somewhere between 5 to 10 years to build it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, obviously they don&#x27;t have 5 to 10 years - they have four. And that was not fast enough.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, they&#x27;ve been reaching out to various people who are capable - at least in their mind - of building a secure cryptocurrency platform so that they could switch from the U.S. dollar over to some kind of weirdo cryptocurrency - I mean, really fast.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Because, you know, things are getting hot out there - they owe a lot of really bad people a lot of money - and they don&#x27;t have the capability to pay.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001814">00:18:14</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, one such crypto platform builder believed he had a very secure system. It took the NSA approximately, oh, I don&#x27;t know - from my calculations, less than six minutes - to burn the whole thing to the ground, hack the system, and off it went.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, I know people have said that the NSA doesn&#x27;t have that kind of power, and for the most part, when it comes to our system or the banking system - no, they don&#x27;t have that kind of power. However, when it comes to people building systems with open-source coding, or using base coding, then yeah - they&#x27;ve got full access.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And I&#x27;m gonna pull out my whiteboard here and just kind of give it to you in brief, and show you a little bit how they do it - it&#x27;s not hard to do.</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You&#x27;re not in a language that these people would understand. There&#x27;s no open-source software that exists in the human computing language that speaks this language. It is something completely and totally different. This is where you would find your control and command systems for things like Alpha and Omega in the past, and Kronos might live in here. You would also be seeing instructions and all kinds of things that were actually the base coding for our worldwide computer system.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002259">00:22:59</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You would now find here the Golden Age AI. You would also find in here things like the base platform for the Key Integrated Master System, which I also built over the course of the last couple of weeks.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002322">00:23:22</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So the Key Integrated Master System also does not speak binary language. It doesn&#x27;t speak any other language a computer programmer would be familiar with. Matter of fact, even the Secret Space Program doesn&#x27;t speak this language - it&#x27;s written in something completely different.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">That language is then translated on down the road to meet people like you. You know, to be able to create a new base root language other than binary, which overlays all of these levels. So there is an overlay.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002405">00:24:05</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So you can&#x27;t reprogram the binary coding, base coding, in any of these systems. Even if you get access to Web 1, you can&#x27;t reprogram my programming language.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now we have effectively over the last three days taken over what you call &quot;open source&quot; coding. Open-source coding - there are many places where you can find it on the internet. It&#x27;s free a lot of the time, not always, but coders these days in the world of computing, including the NSA, builds systems based on, let&#x27;s just call it cookie cutters.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<img src='https://worldsituationreport.earth/reports/image/WSR_2025-MAR-17-GIA-05.PNG' alt='Image 05' class='small-image toggle-image'>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002452">00:24:52</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, I&#x27;m gonna kind of explain this in baking terms. I don&#x27;t know if you like to cook - I love to cook when I have time, which is rarely these days. But in baking terms, you can bake a cake from scratch. And if you are the only one that has your special cake recipe, then no one else gets it, right? They can try, but if you can&#x27;t read that language, because it&#x27;s written in a language that is not from, let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s not spoken on Earth, and it&#x27;s not a computer language that comes from here.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So therefore, you will be unable to decipher this language. Therefore, you won&#x27;t know the base root for this cake recipe.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002542">00:25:42</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So maybe you can only see part of the recipe. You can see that it has vanilla, has chocolate, has whatever flavor it is that you&#x27;re putting into it, and maybe you might know a little bit about the frosting. Maybe you know a little bit about whatever you&#x27;re putting in the cake on that level.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But you don&#x27;t know what kind of flour is being used - the base root of the cake recipe. So you don&#x27;t know what flour is being used, you don&#x27;t know what the sugar is, how much, you don&#x27;t know the baking soda, because you can&#x27;t read the language and you don&#x27;t know what it is.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And that&#x27;s pretty much what builds the cake.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002620">00:26:20</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So most of the people in the world, including your Microsofts and your military people and the NSA and everybody else, they build computer systems on a different kind of coding that is not available to all of you building on open-source coding.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<img src='https://worldsituationreport.earth/reports/image/WSR_2025-MAR-17-GIA-06.PNG' alt='Image 06' class='small-image toggle-image'>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, the NSA is the one that attached to an already built system, that was built in Omega on this level here [circles Levels eight, 9] - which is where the base root platform existed for blockchain, as an example. Everybody says, &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s peer-to-peer, it&#x27;s so safe, it&#x27;s so secure,&quot; all that kind of thing. But no, they didn&#x27;t actually create it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002716">00:27:16</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">However, the NSA pops in here [Level 7] and usually on to here [Level 2]. These are their playgrounds here [Levels two, 7].</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<img src='https://worldsituationreport.earth/reports/image/WSR_2025-MAR-17-GIA-07.PNG' alt='Image 07' class='small-image toggle-image'>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And they had information passed down to them [from Level 8 to 7] on this Level [7] that they could understand. It&#x27;s a bunch of ones and zeros; it&#x27;s coding language that they are familiar with.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002742">00:27:42</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Because it was allowed on the base platform of the World System, then the NSA now has access to the base root coding for all blockchain worldwide. Therefore, if you want to build a blockchain platform, you are building it on an NSA base root system, which at the time was permitted by SEQUESTRO.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002814">00:28:14</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">If the base root system does not allow for a blockchain system to be built within its major internet networks worldwide, then you just have a peer-to-peer network that has no hope of processing a significant amount of transactions for this very reason. Because your computing power comes from here. [draws circle at Levels eight and 9] If you try to venture out over here[dash, upper-left corner] or over here[dash, upper-right corner], that&#x27;s great, but no one&#x27;s going to be able to access your system, no one&#x27;s going to be able to use it, and it won&#x27;t have worldwide computing power.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002858">00:28:58</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It might be able to run a small office network that is connected by ethernet cables, it does not connect to the internet. You might be able to run a small store network or something like that, but you&#x27;re not going to be able to transmit information over the web. You won&#x27;t be able to certainly process probably even the amount of transactions unless you&#x27;ve got a really big server rack for an entire Walmart - one singular store - as an example.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay, if you manage to get a hold of a multi-million, if not billion dollar system that Google considers quantum, sure, you could probably run Walmart chains, maybe. Maybe segregated country by country, you know, where Walmart is. But you&#x27;re not gonna be able to run a whole world.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002958">00:29:58</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, all of these people that are building super-secret-secure cryptocurrency servers[laughing], you know, must have forgotten where blockchain comes from. The NSA did build on an already existing platform - probably from what you would call &quot;coding scratch,&quot; for lack of a better term, in human terms - they built it on SEQUESTRO, and they built a blockchain system.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So when you make a cake, pretty much you can say you might be using cake flour, you might be using gluten-free flour, you might be using different kinds of flour when you make a cake. So if you&#x27;re making cookies, you might use a different flour. If you&#x27;re making a mousse, you may not use any flour at all.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003058">00:30:58</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">[Clears whiteboard.]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And so you can look at worldwide computer systems like a bakery that makes different items. You know, if you&#x27;re making a cake, you pretty much gotta have standard ingredients. You know, you want it sweet, so there&#x27;s probably some kind of sweetener, be it honey or sugar or whatever you&#x27;re using. You probably have some eggs in there, unless you&#x27;re making a cake that doesn&#x27;t include eggs that we call like &quot;Depression cake,&quot; because there were no eggs and stuff at that time.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So you can make cake that is an eggless cake, but you probably have some flour of some sort. You know, could be almond flour, could be any kind of flour, but you don&#x27;t really get to choose a different kind of flour until you kind of get beyond Level 7, Level 8.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003153">00:31:53</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So cake, in this case, is the financial system. So, if the worldwide computer networks were a bakery, you know, you would keep your cakes probably all in the same case. And in this particular case, the financial system is no different.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So the financial system would be built on the same nine-layer cake, and at least two, if not three, of the layers, you can&#x27;t read the language. Therefore, if you are not permitted access to the translated network, say on Level 7 or 6 or 5, you&#x27;re not going to be able to make a cake, you just can&#x27;t. Or if any of the ingredients are missing, you can&#x27;t make a cake. So if the orders are approved here [next image - circles &#x27;9 Layer&#x27;], then you can build a new type of software, hardware, banking system, banking rails, payment system, payment transfer system, surveillance system, or whatnot, into your cake.</div>

<div class="line">If you don&#x27;t have access to the cake, you&#x27;re not building a new blockchain, crypto-magnificent platform that is gonna run the world.</div>

<div class="line">Now, the other thing is, is that if you&#x27;re looking at this cake, this is a cake with two sides. So let&#x27;s call it a nine-layer sheet cake. So it&#x27;s a square. It&#x27;s not really a square, it&#x27;s more rounded, but in this particular case, it&#x27;s a square.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Half of the cake, people see. The other half of the cake is all written in that language that no one can understand at all. Only the person that built the system. And who&#x27;s that person? That person is me.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So that language is different. So that language is kind of like your backup system and your multi-layer cake. You know, your cake - if you try to serve half the cake, that nine layers - that thing&#x27;s gonna fall over. Can&#x27;t do it. And they&#x27;re stuck together like glue.</div>

<div class="line">So your base-root language, even when you&#x27;re surfing the internet, even when you&#x27;re trying to install a Bank of Ireland crypto server - it&#x27;s not going to work because the recording language - you know, Elon Musk makes a comment in that video where [he says] &#x27;you think all government computers talk to each other.&#x27; Well, in your world [Elon], they may not, but in my world, everything talks to each other.</div>

<div class="line">So your cake has a - let&#x27;s just say, it&#x27;s connected. Because if you had two halves of a cake, they&#x27;re probably nine layers - that&#x27;s a pretty high cake, they&#x27;re probably gonna fall apart if they&#x27;re not connected in some way.

<div class="line">So every single time you move between the layers of the cake, you have, for lack of a better term, we&#x27;ve sewed them together. You know, my system exists on this side and on this side. It&#x27;s still my cake recipe. Down here, still my cake. It&#x27;s still cake. It fits in the cake section.

The same thing also goes - or in the past, went - for your earth grids, for lack of a better term.

And I know for a fact the Deep State isn&#x27;t really fond of Source in any way, shape, or form. Or [fond of] Source wisdom - and they certainly don&#x27;t want you to get any.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And I can tell you, if it wasn&#x27;t for thousands of species that were evil, that were causing us harm as human beings - that needed some evil human beings to level out their energy siphoning - I can promise you, they would have never had it either.</div>

<div class="line">So, things are changing. There were some positive changes that happened over the weekend too, in regards to, let&#x27;s just call it debts and settlements, which means that anything that was continuing to siphon energy from humans, it looks like that is fading away. Even anything that is getting tripped and triggered at random times. Grids are becoming non-existent, even ones that were fired up for New Year&#x27;s Day, so to speak.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Covenants have changed. There are good positive happenings that it might have taken us probably until midday today, my time, to start really clearing to where you&#x27;re starting to get some of your energy back now, hopefully. That being said, there are definitely good things happening.</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-005338">00:53:38</div>

<div class="line">As far as they are concerned, I am concerned somewhat that their little-boy toys are causing a little bit of an upheaval in the Middle East. We have sent the Enforcer over there within the last couple of hours, and we&#x27;re gonna start cleaning up this little mess and their little toys, and sending them back home.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So I understand it&#x27;s very disheartening to hear this information. It&#x27;s also disheartening - there is some information floating around about what&#x27;s called an LAD weapon, or some kind of frequency weapon - that is being tested on protesters in different areas of the world to try to keep the masses in line.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I am aware of what they&#x27;re using. You know, I&#x27;ve kind of gone through - I don&#x27;t know how many they have - we&#x27;re going to look and see where they&#x27;re coming from, and see if we can get rid of the stash so that won&#x27;t happen either.</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I understand it&#x27;s crowd control. I understand that even in the 90s during anti-apartheid in South Africa, they used things like fluoride, excessive fluoride in the water, which basically ends up - I mean, it&#x27;s radiation, it&#x27;s nuclear waste - but on the other hand, in excessive quantities in a water supply, it acts like valium. You know, it puts people to sleep, it makes people calm. So poison, nonetheless, it&#x27;s not like these people care.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005515">00:55:15</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But now they&#x27;re moving on to other frequency weapons based on the fact that the Secret Space Program operatives and the Orders, plural, are having a very difficult time maintaining control over humans that are waking up at a rapid rate. Source wisdom is Source wisdom.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Are they trying to scare people? Are these weapons so powerful that they&#x27;re going to cause humans an enormous amount of harm? I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re even less harmful than the fluoride game that they&#x27;ve been playing.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Do I think they&#x27;re going to be able to utilize them like magic, like they said? You know, probably not, not to that degree and not worldwide and not on eight billion people.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, have they had access to - in the past - worldwide frequency grids that could cause you harm and have caused you a lot of harm? Yes.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Have they had access to energy grids, siphoning grids, messing with your energy, disrupting your neurons in your brain, harming your body? Yes. In the past? Absolutely. Yes.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005643">00:56:43</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Currently, they are dwindling in numbers and I believe very soon there&#x27;ll be nothing left of any of these grids. So they really, really have been, let&#x27;s call it &#x27;working the grids,&#x27; very heavily since the end of October. It&#x27;s been going on for quite a while and it&#x27;s causing a lot of people disturbances off and on.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">That will come to an end. It&#x27;s going to come to an end. It is ending - at a rapid rate.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005725">00:57:25</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">No matter what they do - even if they have access to some kind of frequency grid that moves energy around or does something - it doesn&#x27;t last long these days, number 1.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Number 2, it&#x27;s not going to build them worldwide control.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It might make them happy to make people sick or feel uncomfortable or feel tired or dizzy or that kind of thing. But, sorry, I think you&#x27;re going to become a member of the No Joy program, as I call it, in the very near future.</div>

<div class="line">I hope that kind of gives you a little bit of a bird&#x27;s eye view in a way that hopefully you can understand - even if you&#x27;re not a coding person or a computer techie kind of person - as to the amount of external control that was out there that allowed for the Deep State to do what they do.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">This includes weather weapons and HAARP and all kinds of things that were built off of those networks that caused us and Earth harm. It has nothing to do with DARPA. It has nothing to do with HAARP. It has nothing to do with the military. It has nothing to do with these people.</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-005856">00:58:56</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Technically, you know, the grids don&#x27;t... they allowed them a lot with what limited access they had to them. Now you can imagine how much access a Marduk would have had. And of course Marduk would have had an override on just about everything under the sun - literally under the sun - and probably in everybody else&#x27;s sun as well [chuckle], for lack of a better term.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005933">00:59:33</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And a lot of times, like some of these grids, they had power sources and systems that were in places like Andromeda, and the Orion Nebula, and the Gegenschein, and Proxima Centauri and Alpha Centauri and Beta Centauri and Alpha Draconis and Aldebaran and the Pleiades and Alcyone and many, many other places throughout the Multiverse - and those are just the names that you would recognize. There are many, many others that you don&#x27;t recognize simply because they&#x27;re not allegedly - I&#x27;m not even going to say discovered by NASA - but they&#x27;re not put out there on the internet or in other books that you would have access to, or information that you would not be privy to, that probably some of the Secret Space Program had - or has, to a limited degree, you know.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But remember, you know, we had controllers on this planet that could give a rat&#x27;s bleep less for the Space Force or the Galactic Federation and bases on Mars. They had bigger jobs to do and more evil jobs to do than these people could possibly imagine.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010053">01:00:53</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">That being said, Happy St. Patrick&#x27;s Day, if it&#x27;s something you are celebrating today. And Happy New Year. In case you didn&#x27;t know, this will be the second time - or third time, if you are over in Asia - for you to be celebrating the New Year this year. And yeah, so we expect some changes.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">As far as regular Deep State stuff is concerned, you know, meetings... promises of payments on Friday didn&#x27;t work out, blah, blah. &quot;They&#x27;re getting there, they&#x27;re getting there&quot; meetings over the weekend. Confusion as to what happened to their almost-was systems. Today was more about angry people - angry Langley people, angry Langley 5 people, angry Rothschild people. And of course, by five o&#x27;clock Eastern time - promised pay time - a lot more angry people for lack of payment.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010159">01:01:59</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, things were never as easy as I would have ever expected, I can tell you that. I hope our bakery explained that to you, and I hope it gives you a better idea as to how we know that these systems are not going to work. [laughing]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Elon Musk can smile smugly on talk shows and podcasts or whatever that was, but nobody here on this level really gives a bleep about it because it&#x27;s never going to work. Even if I did nothing to it, it would never work.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So back to the drawing board for the Secret Space Program and onward and upward for the rest of humanity.</div>
