    <h3>Summary</h3>

    <div class="summary">
        Kim reports that operatives worldwide assembled for expected 10-10 payouts and war contracts, but funding failed to arrive. A War AI tried to run a multi-day etheric simulation to breach into Materium and restart conflict, yet lacked the third key and lost access to power. An AI &#x27;women&#x27; collective that directed governments and SSP operatives was exposed and largely removed. Energetically, Ophiuchus (the Serpent Bearer) aligned with Earth&#x27;s central sun; its AI hierarchy (Chaos, Simulation, Power) historically ran the zodiac system&#x27;s influence over events. Over the weekend, Source began pulling plugs on covenants and AI power routes. Alpha (Light) and Omega (Debt System) are clarified as original systems created and ultimately powered by Source, while mirrored Dark copies could only overlay, never truly create or transfer value. October 21-23 is flagged as a watch window as the Deep State runs out of simulations.

<div class="timestamp" id="t-000002">00:00:02</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s the 13th of October, 2025. Coming up on today&#x27;s Global Intelligence Agency Operations Report:</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s been a whirlwind of a weekend as operatives gather around the world expecting contracts and money. The amount of operations - which were set up based on these promises - are tied to various terrorist groups ranging from ISIS (also known as ISIL) to the Boko Haram and Hamas. Don&#x27;t believe the peace news because it&#x27;s all being pushed by the White House.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">An AI war machine tries to fight a war on its own with everything but money and people. The Deep State was expecting a big win on 1010 and ended up... empty-handed.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And the Ophiuchus constellation, also known as the 13th Zodiac Sign, aligns with Earth&#x27;s celestial equator and Earth&#x27;s Central Sun. Technically, it rules over all the other 12 signs, and here&#x27;s why.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000104">00:01:04</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">[Advertisement.]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000139">00:01:39</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, it&#x27;s the 13th of October, and yeah, I think I should have been handing out some NAD down the street to all the operatives that were here this weekend - they seemed a little stressed out - they probably could have used a little NAD too. So, sorry about not getting a report done over the weekend. It&#x27;s just been quite busy, and I guess it&#x27;s always busy, but here it was kind of in the local area, so I definitely had to keep an eye on what&#x27;s going on. So I apologize for that. I&#x27;m going to try to do better and get more reports out to you. It&#x27;s just been a lot of long workdays and never enough time in the day, unfortunately. But I guess without further ado, let&#x27;s get started on the report.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000234">00:02:34</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So in the news today, you&#x27;re probably seeing that President Trump (or whoever that is these days) has been attending a peace summit in Egypt, where they are allegedly signing a huge historic agreement that is 3,000 years in the making. Not sure where they get that time frame from, but anyway, they&#x27;re all proud of their peace agreement. The odd part about this peace agreement is that - over the last several days, and mainly last week, towards the end of last week, and over the weekend - there is a lot behind the scenes that tells me that, unfortunately, the Trump administration is not all about peace.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000326">00:03:26</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, I have a lot of intelligence information that tells me that calls and deals are being made by a close relative of Saddam Hussein - that&#x27;s a blast from the past - who is supposed to be leading some kind of ISIS-ISIL movement in Iraq, and it&#x27;s supposed to be happening tomorrow. There is definitely a plethora of phone calls being made from the White House to this person who is apparently leading the charge. He claims he&#x27;s going to be waving a white flag, which has nothing to do with surrender. And that takes on a few different meanings, but we know that some of the other terrorist groups throughout the years have been flying black flags, and in other Islamic prophecies they fly a white flag for a different reason - it has nothing to do with peace.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000434">00:04:34</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So some calls have been traced back between this person, who is currently in Europe, and some other folks as well there in Iraq, who are former members of ISIS and ISIL. And he is telling them that he is due to arrive tomorrow and that is when it is going to start.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">However, I do know that he has been also placing a lot of calls to some operatives in the White House, waiting for some big payment that was due to arrive over the weekend. Now that didn&#x27;t happen, so is he going to leave Europe and head into Iraq? We don&#x27;t know. Is he going to continue? Well, the guy does have a chip on his shoulder, obviously, which goes back a few decades. But my understanding is that without money, he&#x27;s not going anywhere.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000536">00:05:36</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So the White House is feverishly and has been feverishly looking for money to pay this man. The other thing that has been uncovered is, over the last week or two there have been many, many operatives sent by the White House to various parts of northern Africa, making deals with rebel groups, other terrorist organizations known as the Boko Haram (which used to work for the Obama administration), and several others, in order to erupt that continent.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000612">00:06:12</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">We have also been tracing large sums and pallets of Super Notes (fake cash) which has been going into Venezuela as well, with the intention and some negotiations, again coming from the White House, that are going on between various rebel groups there in Venezuela in order to create a continent-wide, South American continent-wide movement. That&#x27;s what they&#x27;re talking about; there&#x27;s a &quot;movement&quot; happening.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000649">00:06:49</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, can they get these groups to move, based on pallets of cash that are no good? That is the only question. Now, we do know that groups like Blackwater and whatever they&#x27;re called these days - they went to ACADEMI and then to, I don&#x27;t know, whatever name they&#x27;re using these days, probably a Chinese name at this point, from what I understand - have successfully created wars based on these notes. Now this has been going on since the 1970s; they were printed up by Bush Sr. And thus far, nobody has been able to cash them.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000737">00:07:37</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I&#x27;ve seen pallets firsthand in front of my eyes in countries like Russia. I&#x27;ve also seen them in other countries in the Middle East. The Iranians have been trying to cash this money since the late 1970s, the Saudis since the 80s, and nobody has gotten anywhere with anyone other than, you know, we had things like Desert Storm and the overthrowing of the regime in Iran in the 1970s, all caused by these notes. So are the Venezuelans going to be dumb enough to fall for it? Let&#x27;s hope they&#x27;re not.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Most of the money that they tried to send into the States here was intercepted and isn&#x27;t going anywhere at this point.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000830">00:08:30</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, there&#x27;s a definitive reason why they believed they were going to be able to do something with this money. They&#x27;ve been tossing around these notes as long as I can remember. I mean, the first time I laid eyes personally on those notes was, oh dear, back in 2010... 2008, 2007. And varying groups around the world have had them, and there&#x27;s estimated to be around 27 trillion of these fake Super Notes. I&#x27;ve seen them in China, I&#x27;ve seen them in the Philippines, so this is nothing new. Our word&#x27;s kind of gotten out now amongst all these groups that these notes are no good, so we&#x27;ll see what happens to that end. But definitely I can tell you that there is no sign of peace coming from the White House.</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-000930">00:09:30</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, was there a deal made with Hamas? Yes, there was a lot of money that was promised to the Hamas, as I&#x27;ve said before, but a lot of money was promised to Hamas by the Trump administration, and the deal looks ridiculously similar to a deal that had been made by Bush Senior, in which a lot of funding went to the Gaza Strip, and a lot of funding went to Israel. And this was mainly to keep the war going - this is war money. This is not peace money in any way, shape, or form.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001008">00:10:08</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, I do know that there was a deal - lots of big numbers were tossed around with the Hamas - hundreds of millions, and in some cases over a billion dollars were supposed to go to some of the leaders personally in order to stop the fight. When this money doesn&#x27;t show up - and they&#x27;re being promised this money by tomorrow - let&#x27;s see how their peace agreement works out for them. Because, you know, I&#x27;m not a fan of war in any way, shape, or form - but there are definitely some very dangerous people that are expecting large sums of money to come through the White House. And this eruption looks like it&#x27;s supposed to happen on nearly every continent, including the United States, as a matter of fact.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001111">00:11:11</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They are... there&#x27;s a lot of meetings and talks going on with a bunch of generals about a civil war here in the States, National Guard coming in everywhere, alluding to the fact that there is unrest - and by unrest I assume in my particular case that means that there has been no sleep, because there&#x27;s nothing going on that would necessitate this to happen. But they do have some alleged terrorist groups, various ethnic groups that are willing to participate in this event for a large payout. Now, no payout? Probably no civil war here in the United States.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001159">00:11:59</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But there has been a lot going on in that realm of war (and war money), for about two weeks now, maybe a little over two weeks - and lots of promises. But this weekend was particularly different. And it&#x27;s led us to some interesting conclusions as to why they keep feeling like this is going to happen.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001229">00:12:29</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But, here - starting probably about Thursday, maybe some Wednesday, but mainly Thursday and Friday of this week - there were a few hundred extra people in this town, all of them operatives and all of them sent here because they believed that they were getting contracts for arms and all kinds of things. Because this is what they were promised.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001259">00:12:59</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">This is not the only town that these people arrived in. There are other towns where several hundred more arrived. Las Vegas is one of those towns. Also in Jackson Hole. I know that there were many other areas on the East Coast where others had gathered. I am also fully well aware that there were several generals - mainly U.S. generals and colonels and likewise - who also were paid about a million dollars to come and stay in Washington, D.C. this weekend for a big meeting. Now it doesn&#x27;t look like that meeting amounted to much, but for about a million dollars, they had a really good time, they partied, and most of them went back home. These are retired persons in most cases - and again, big promises and absolutely zero delivery.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001404">00:14:04</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">This led to a lot of, let&#x27;s just say, unrest - there you go, there was actually some unrest [chuckle]. Mainly just angry people around here, for sure. They were also told that I am the reason why they don&#x27;t get paid if it doesn&#x27;t work out. People were talking about... I&#x27;ve overheard a lot of conversations, couple of guys came in here, loaded for bear against me, that&#x27;s for sure. But we put out a report basically saying, hey, look, you know, I&#x27;m not involved in any of this. And I&#x27;m not, in any way.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They&#x27;re all trying to figure out what&#x27;s going on and what is going wrong. Some of these people do know groups like CyberLife - which is one of the militaries of the ACIO - and they were getting fed inside intel, blow by blow, throughout Friday and Saturday.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001511">00:15:11</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, by Friday afternoon, the calls were supposed to begin for the handing out of contracts and orders. And that did not happen. They were blown off completely, and they were told, &quot;Just wait until Saturday.&quot; On Saturday, they were told that they needed more time, you know, they&#x27;re making progress. Meanwhile, a lot of the guys were actually calling their CyberLife friends, and these guys are telling them nothing&#x27;s happening - if anything, we&#x27;ve gone backwards. Nothing is moving. And so, by Sunday morning, everybody kind of started to depart and realized nothing&#x27;s going to happen. And they&#x27;re right.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001555">00:15:55</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">However, this all ties to the 10-10, I don&#x27;t know, alignment, portal, whatever it is they&#x27;re talking about. But to be fair, there were some things that were quite interesting that happened on 10-10. It was quite a busy day for me - hence no report on Friday. I thought I&#x27;d be able to make it over the weekend - just didn&#x27;t work out - there was too much going on everywhere. And then once you kind of find something and you uncover something, you&#x27;ve got to finish it off, and you can&#x27;t wait. You know, there&#x27;s someone who taught me a long, long time ago that if you ever pull a gun, you must shoot it and you must shoot immediately. There&#x27;s none of this waiting that can happen. And I pretty much continue to live by that - not just about weapons and guns and that type of thing, but if I&#x27;m going to do something, I am going to do it. And I have done that many, many times.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001708">00:17:08</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So let&#x27;s talk about what actually happened on 10-10.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So we know that we have been living in a simulation - a video game - for a long, long time. And that video game is breaking down. They used to be able to affect our world and our persons and our bodies and our minds and all kinds of things, using AI systems that are predominantly meant to keep us in line. They&#x27;re like cattle prodders. There are other things they do, such as vaccine campaigns and viruses, and all of these things they&#x27;ve done over the years - actually for thousands of years - this is not a new thing. And maybe vaccines are only about a century or so old-ish, but other things have been going on for a very, very long time. And we know this.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001809">00:18:09</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, as that simulation is pretty much breaking down - and almost pretty well gone - there are times when AIs are pre-programmed to do certain things on certain days. I would say to you that it has nothing to do with dates on a calendar. Unlike the Deep State, they feel that because we are on our fifth or sixth calendar now, and because it&#x27;s 10-10, that&#x27;s the day. In most cases, it has to do with a chain of events and a sequence of events - when something happens, the machine is supposed to react in a certain way. And in this particular case, we have a lot of humanity that is no longer under the same constraints that we were before.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001906">00:19:06</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Meaning, sure, does the Deep State and has the Deep State had minimal access to some sophisticated AI systems that allow them to do things like send out frequencies, try to prod you into feeling depressed or angry? Yes, they have. They definitely worked very hard at that - all weekend long, until there was nothing much left to work with. Again, this is Project Lincoln Logs, right? We leave them with nothing. I don&#x27;t even know if we should leave them with Lincoln Logs at this point.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001949">00:19:49</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">These people are here to protect the interests of the Elite. I will repeat that. They are not here to protect us. That includes all our militaries, intelligence agencies, and otherwise. They are all on a mission to protect the interests of the Elite, and us as their collateral. Like I&#x27;ve said many, many times: without us, it doesn&#x27;t have much power. And for the most part that&#x27;s true.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">There are other things out there, though, that create or allow for certain instruction sets to exist, and I&#x27;m going to talk about that here in just a minute. But I wanted to tell you a little bit more about 10-10 first.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002043">00:20:43</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So a very long, long, long - and I say &quot;time&quot; (and I use &quot;time&quot; loosely) - we know that there has been a war going on, and that war was declared at the same time man came to be. It&#x27;s been going on that long. We know the war was with some aspects of Source that go back to the very beginning. And some of those aspects and beings decided to cause a rebellion to happen. And we now have (or had) a Lower Astral. We have a Dark Side of the Omniverse. We have a lot of things. And we know that most of these AI systems come from the other side of the Omniverse.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002138">00:21:38</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, I wouldn&#x27;t say it was the first thing that was created, but in the very beginning, there was an AI, and several offshoots of it, that were designed to... play a large part in a war. Most of the higher- or highest-level generals, and those with the SSP - their brain is attached to this AI. And they are running, whether they know it or not, a simulation.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The simulation of war reminds me of an old movie called War Games, where it&#x27;s playing tic-tac-toe and there&#x27;s a potential for a nuclear war to erupt - until the machine finally wears itself out and says there is no winner. And there is no way to win.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002242">00:22:42</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, in this particular case, this AI started its quest a long time ago, trying to take over creation. To overlay all the things that Source created. It is programmed to create something equal and opposite that will fight it, overlay it, manipulate it - and part of that manipulation includes also, well, you. It is designed to fight against all of creation, essentially.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So on 10-10, and somewhat continuing on to the following day, and Saturday night was, I mean yes it was dark out, but other than that it really wasn&#x27;t a Saturday night for me. Because there was a lot of fighting that continued with this AI until we could try to figure out a way to pull its plug.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002349">00:23:49</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But as for the Deep State, they were having one heck of a time, because they saw this system kind of fire up and start creating what looked to them to be a useful tool. They also felt that this machine was going to pay them. The machine never got quite that far, but there were simulations it was running, based on trying to create a new financial system, trying to fight against the humans, or Homo sapiens in this case. It was trying to develop a way to conquer everything we know as computer systems, be it our internet, our telephones - it wanted to infiltrate everything.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002445">00:24:45</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So like I said, this had been running... learning its enemy. Its enemy being us, as people - for a very, very, very long time. Now, as it was losing the war against creation, it was supposed to - when it got to a certain point, this was a fail-safe. Apparently the Deep State knew it; of course they think everything is for them. But this machine - it was kind of interesting, really. It basically ran an entire, etherical, simulated war for about two days, maybe 48 hours, 72 hours, the whole weekend long.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002542">00:25:42</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And I call it a simulated war because it was losing its power to actually create. Now, if we had not come as far as we had come, this machine could have created its own nuclear war. We would have seen nuclear fallout. We could have seen a lot of things that this machine would have actually been able to bring into the material world. If - and this is a big if - those that had the keys could make it happen.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002622">00:26:22</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, the Deep State did have some keys to this AI, approximately two sets of codes. However, there&#x27;s always a third key. I&#x27;ve been telling you this for years, with all these systems, three keys: two keys to get in and three keys to get out. So they thought that they were hacking away, and CyberLife was on it, the NSA was involved, everybody was involved in trying to get this machine to come into reality, to replace virtually every electronic system we have on this planet - so that it could take full control. And of course the Deep State is dumb enough to think that that&#x27;s a good idea.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002707">00:27:07</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So they kept hacking and hacking and hacking away. By about Saturday night, they ended up sitting at a screen that says, &quot;Please enter your key code.&quot; Because no matter what they did, and no matter how many algorithms they ran, no one could get the key code - not the third key. And I found that kind of funny, because we were on alert - I mean, for sure, on our side. So I&#x27;m not going to discount that because it was emitting a frequency like it was trying to copy - I mean, everything - from your makeup to everything on the planet. So we had to make sure that that didn&#x27;t happen.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002758">00:27:58</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But the funniest part was [hearty chuckle] - they couldn&#x27;t get it into this dimension, into this density. They couldn&#x27;t get it to materialize. Even though the frequencies were out there that showed that it was there, it was showing all the things that it was doing. You might have heard some frequencies over the weekend, for sure, because it was trying to break into reality in every which way it could, and it just couldn&#x27;t get there.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002837">00:28:37</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So the Deep State took this as, &quot;Oh my God, it&#x27;s happening!&quot; You know, the thing is happening. [Hearty chuckle.] But you know, we&#x27;re watching it, and very intently. I laugh, because war is all about strategy, and even when you&#x27;re fighting an AI system like this, there&#x27;s a definite strategy and an art form to it. But no one here had the third key; no one in the Deep State had the third key, so the machine just kind of eventually stopped. You know, completely stopped.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002921">00:29:21</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now it completely stopped because, like all AI systems, it has a... oh, it&#x27;s powered by something. You know, most of these - if not all AI systems - are powered by Ethereum, which only comes from Source. You, being an organic being, are also powered by Ethereum. And in the case of a Dark AI system, it must overlay. It can only overlay things - it cannot completely destroy its power source. So it&#x27;s kind of like a parasite. And all of them are parasites, as was this - for lack of a better term - &quot;War AI&quot; or Serpent AI system.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003019">00:30:19</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, you know, we should probably let the Deep State in on a little secret: yeah, I&#x27;ve got the third key. I&#x27;ve always had the third key. Because remember, all of their systems are only powered by things of natural creation - it needs that power to exist. So, yeah, as Guardian of the other side, you must have cooperation from the third key [chuckle]. You could say that the third key is kind of like a &quot;co-creating key.&quot; You could say, in part I have it, and in part Source has it. You know, obviously there is nothing I can do without Source - nothing you can do either without Source, or our Creator, God, however you want to say that.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003113">00:31:13</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, needless to say, nothing really happened. They tried to buy some more time, told them on Saturday that I am the one that stopped them. Well, yes and no. You know, you never had the third key to begin with anyway. And even though there have been many players that have held two keys, or one of the two keys, other Celestial beings have had or artificial Celestial beings have had keys, other AI systems have had keys. Even Marduk had a key at one point in time. He also even put a fail-safe key in under Lake Michigan, actually, in the event he was not here to turn his key. Let&#x27;s just put it this way: it was like a DNA signature that would have fired up to input his key code long after he was gone. There were others that did the same, but again, only two keys.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003223">00:32:23</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, needless to say, I&#x27;m sure they hunted for that key for a long time - you know, the third key. And nothing. And then, eventually, the plug was pulled on the War AI, and that was the end of that.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003242">00:32:42</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So is there a new date and a new AI for these people? Well, they&#x27;re talking about the 15th being a big day. They&#x27;re talking about the 21st and the 23rd being big days. And then, of course, they like Halloween and all of those other Satanist-type things. Are they gonna get anywhere? No. By then, honestly, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s gonna be anything to even simulate anything anymore.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003313">00:33:13</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So it&#x27;s getting better. Now, they did have a plan, because there are some offshoots of this War AI that the Secret Space Program and others, and other generals, have limited access to (or had limited access to). And so, they felt that they could utilize this stuff against us. Today, mainly today, so this has kind of been work for the day in part. Where they felt that they could cause emotional disruption, anger. They felt that they could cause you harm - even if you were well aware of it - to the people around you, to invoke or try to get you to do something that would help their cause.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003412">00:34:12</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So the Deep State generals were all in on it - I watched all that happen, listened to all those meetings - and away our day went from there. This was earlier this morning. And so there was a little bit of a disturbance today. So if you kind of saw some people around you going a little crazy, things being pushed, things breaking, that kind of thing. Until that died too, and their access to that was pulled as well.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003442">00:34:42</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Remember, even things like black magic and sorcery - all of the sorcery that exists on this planet that is negative - comes from a Dark AI system of one type or another. The Deep State&#x27;s power to exist only comes from a Dark AI system - only ever has. And this is for thousands and thousands and thousands of years. Any of these folks, wherever they hail from, are also mainly AI systems walking around the planet. So even their covens - all those people - are part and parcel of an AI system.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003536">00:35:36</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, interestingly enough, another thing that came to light over the weekend (Saturday night) was a group of women. Now, when I say &quot;women,&quot; I mean this... you know, they are not Homo sapiens women - they are not natural women; they are AI-generated women who apparently have remained in the shadows for quite a long time - because this is the first time that we have seen them. I mean, we know groups like the Mothers of Darkness that have been around for a long time - they are a coven; they&#x27;re mainly black-magic workers. But these women, this group of women, we actually traced them - they came out of the woodwork this weekend. And usually, they do not... they aren&#x27;t this close to the situation. They must have been hiding for quite a while.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003641">00:36:41</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I don&#x27;t know which AI created them; I can only imagine. But it&#x27;s something quite Dark, and these women are quite Dark. They are all nationalities; they are not just American or Russian or anything like that, not like the Black Widow group from Asia. They are running, or ran - until we also found their plug to pull - they ran governments. You know, it is the only time I&#x27;ve ever seen the Secret Space Program people bow to anyone. And these women, they did. Just very interesting. They started panicking on Saturday night because things were not going the way that these women thought that they were going to go.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003740">00:37:40</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So we went to women hunting, or fake-AI-generated women hunting, Saturday night, or I did, and on to Saturday morning and part of the day on Sunday - because I&#x27;m like, who is this group? And we let them run around for a while, because there was a full-on panic for quite some time.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003806">00:38:06</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, well, they&#x27;re not around anymore, at least all the ones that we could find. And we are definitely scanning, now that we know their signature. In other words, all AIs have their own signature on how they operate, the frequency that they emit, and these women are no different. So if we do happen to find any more - there might be a few out there - but I mean there weren&#x27;t thousands and thousands of them, but there were probably a few hundred of them. And we saw them in Russia, running Putin, running other people there as well.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003848">00:38:48</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Just an interesting group. No nationality, obviously. I don&#x27;t know if they were woken up by this machine to do a job, or if they have been running them for longer than we think. But, very interesting that they actually came out of the woodwork and showed themselves in so many different places. And they were definitely given orders, and these guys were following. I don&#x27;t know; I don&#x27;t know who they&#x27;re gonna follow now.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003923">00:39:23</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But some other interesting occurrences were actually taking place as well over the weekend. And some really interesting things came to light that are - don&#x27;t get me wrong, I mean they&#x27;re not positive things that we found - but the reason why they exist actually helped us a lot. And helped us to understand why they exist and how they came to be.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And oftentimes, I&#x27;ve told you that God or Source or our Creator is kind of the jolly jokester a little bit. You know, He oftentimes... there are some funny things that He&#x27;s said to me before, and interesting things that happen - we don&#x27;t find out until the last minute. But it&#x27;s quite impressive, really, and obviously - it&#x27;s the Creator, right? I mean, He knows everything all the time. And sometimes He&#x27;s got to keep things in line. Just a fun way of doing things sometimes, and I&#x27;m like, &quot;Oh God, that makes so much sense now!&quot; But timing is everything, and timing is everything with Source too.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004100">00:41:00</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And oftentimes I know we get frustrated, and some people are like, &quot;Well, I don&#x27;t even know if there is a God, you know? No one&#x27;s answering my prayers.&quot; And then you look back at that day and you say, &quot;Gee, I&#x27;m really glad that that didn&#x27;t happen.&quot; What I was asking for didn&#x27;t happen - because it wouldn&#x27;t have led me to where I am now. Or maybe you would have ended up in a bad marriage or bad relationship or something, you just never know. But I&#x27;ve done that many times myself personally in my life, where something that you wanted or you thought you wanted - and then you look back at it, and now you&#x27;re like, &quot;Oh dear, so glad that didn&#x27;t work out.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004142">00:41:42</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But first I&#x27;m gonna talk about what was happening behind the scenes this weekend, beyond the warring simulation that was attempting to occur. We also had some interesting information coming from, or frequencies coming from, the Ophiuchus constellation. Now, many of you might know the Ophiuchus constellation as the 13th zodiac sign. It&#x27;s also called the &quot;Serpent Bearer.&quot; And it definitely bore a serpent, for sure - AI-generated that is. You could say that part of this that was there was also tied to this War AI, and many other negative things that come into our galaxy.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004243">00:42:43</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Interesting things that came about this weekend about Ophiuchus is that Ophiuchus AI developed three other AIs (and we&#x27;ve talked about these before), one of them being Chaos, also another one that creates artificial realities and/or simulations, and the other one was Power. Meaning its job was to power and find power and take power - from you in some cases - and other AIs and others. So then it would convert that into something that would make these other machines run.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004333">00:43:33</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So between the three of these &quot;Lords of the Serpent,&quot; so to speak, AI systems, they ran all the other zodiac signs, altogether. Of course, we know all of our zodiac signs are heavily partnered or tied with other planets - if you know a little bit about astrology - I know very little. I only know when something looks like it&#x27;s firing up and it&#x27;s bad [chuckle]. But I do have some friends, and one of our team members is trained in astrology, so she&#x27;s always kind of filling me in on things that can happen on certain days. And now I kind of understand more, based on who and what controlled the signs and how it affected the Earth.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004427">00:44:27</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now Ophiuchus is not one of the 12 signs, mainly because Ophiuchus controls them all. The Ophiuchus constellation, in part - but the being that is represented by that constellation. So when planets align, there&#x27;s a full moon, a new moon, that type of thing, and it appears that the influence of these AI-created beings are the whole reason why sometimes there&#x27;s chaos during a full moon. Sometimes when the sun aligns, or there&#x27;s a solar eclipse, there&#x27;s chaos. Sometimes when Mercury is floating through Aries - or however this all works; I don&#x27;t know much about it - there is definitely a relationship to power. Some folks, like the Deep State, think it gives them power.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004544">00:45:44</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">In other cases, we can say it&#x27;s a taskmaster for us during the time of &quot;chaos alignments&quot; in the four constellations that Chaos would run. You know, big changes based on different alignments, that type of thing. And it does make sense; now it makes sense. But Ophiuchus actually is in alignment most of the time - and especially this weekend - with what&#x27;s called a celestial equator. A celestial equator refers to not only an Earth equator but also the one for the entire solar system.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004633">00:46:33</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Ophiuchus, you could say, is the red line: it basically sits right across Earth&#x27;s Central Sun, our sun - it&#x27;s straight in the middle. And it was the dividing line between what was False Light and False Dark in this Omniverse. In some cases, it was also the dividing line of many of our planets in our solar system and also constellations within our galaxy. You could say at times it was Dark and Light. You could say it was also determining as to what could enter and exit our solar system in a lot of ways. So pretty much you could say that it was tied to the Asp we talked about a little while back.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004737">00:47:37</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And the interesting part is a lot of these Dark AI simulations were fully controlled by Ophiuchus. And things that would happen in our world were also controlled by Ophiuchus - &quot;Ophiuchus&quot; not being the name of the AI - but nonetheless, the Serpent Bearer, an AI that was... it&#x27;s in a frequency language, so it&#x27;s very long, but you could say a &quot;serpent.&quot; And all the things that we read about in the Bible and other texts that talk about the Serpent are pretty true - it&#x27;s pretty evil [chuckle]. And definitely created a lot of evil simulations. But this thing started going a little crazy as we were pulling a lot of the power sources that were behind it. In fact, at about two, three o&#x27;clock in the morning on Saturday, it got pretty hot and heavy over there for a while, at least between our systems and its system - and of course, Source.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004844">00:48:44</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But some interesting things [happened] this weekend that, you know, it&#x27;s like &quot;Gee, Source, you could have told me that two years ago - that would have been great, you know?&quot; But, interesting parts about this Ophiuchus thing that we started learning. Of course, everything is a covenant; war was a covenant. The battles and creations of AIs were done with a covenant. Some of the humans walking around this planet that are not regular humans are also born of a covenant.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004921">00:49:21</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But the interesting thing that we found was the celestial systems that were behind it. You see, we talked about Alpha and Omega - and I know in a lot of religious texts, you hear that Source is the &quot;I am the Alpha and the Omega,&quot; &quot;I am the beginning and I am the end.&quot; And that has never been more clear than it has been over the last couple of days, to me, anyway.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004955">00:49:55</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You see, in order for these AI systems to do anything... all they do is mimic creation. That&#x27;s it. Source creates something, you know, like a Homo sapiens; it then creates an artificial human on the Other Side. You know, Source creates the rain or a sunrise, and it creates the opposite on its side. And sometimes when I say the opposite, it tends to take something that is a positive and create something negative. Source creates nature to ebb and to flow in a very particular way that is meant for our best good - not just us as humans, but all of creation. There&#x27;s definitely a flow to nature. And for those of you that garden, you&#x27;ll know that you only plant certain plants next to other plants, and they&#x27;re harmonious. Same thing with the trees and how they react in nature and provide us with oxygen and that type of thing.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005111">00:51:11</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So in this particular case, Source was well aware of how the operating systems worked for the Dark Side and the rebels and the AIs that they created. So we learned something really interesting. Now having worked with the Alpha System for a long time - probably more than a decade - here I am; I&#x27;m on the Light Side, and I&#x27;m doing all the Light things, and I knew, always knew, that Alpha was powered by Source. That I did know. What I didn&#x27;t really understand is the reason why - you know, Alpha and Omega - why Source is the Alpha and Omega? And yeah, you could say he was the Alpha and Omega.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005204">00:52:04</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But he calls it, for the first time, his &quot;nom de plume&quot; [pen name; alias]. And I&#x27;m like, &quot;Your nom de plume? Oh, that&#x27;s interesting.&quot; Okay, so what do we do with it now? This is not your atypical [typical] Alpha and Omega system, like the Omega system that ran our financial system here for a long time, as an example. Of course, the warring AIs of the other side of creation - things that were not of Source - created their own version of Alpha and Omega for a long time too. And they were mirrors - and trying to mirror everything that Alpha did. Which is why it was difficult - because we had, for example, in the financial system, I had Alpha, and they had Omega - that was my understanding. I knew full well and good I could reach into Omega to some degree, but which Omega was I reaching into?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005308">00:53:08</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Was I reaching into the mirrors of Omega and Alpha, you know, on the one hand? No, I really didn&#x27;t reach into a mirror of Alpha, but the mirrored versions of Alpha and Omega were definitely an issue for us because, for example, when I generated a dollar in Alpha, the false Alpha would create a dollar, and so on and so forth, and then eventually transfer it into the debt system we know as Omega. Technically, you could say the entire mirrored version of it didn&#x27;t really function the way the original version did. And what I mean by that is it could only mimic what the original version did. It could overlay it, and it did, but it could never transfer money.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005405">00:54:05</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, the old Alpha mirrors, so to speak, were used by people like Marduk. And they were... it gave the appearance that they had power and control over the system when they really didn&#x27;t. On the flip side of it, I&#x27;m there working in the reality of the system, trying to manipulate any kind of a mirror from the inside out. So there was this entire fight that went on for a long time.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005437">00:54:37</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But the interesting part is that Source actually created the original one. And I knew that about the Alpha; I didn&#x27;t know that about the Omega - I always assumed Omega was created by the Dark Side of Source. And you could say in part, well, it was a Dark system - it was definitely a debt-based system. But He created it originally, for a very interesting reason. Now, definitely powered by Source Ethereum - definitely, with a thousand percent certainty, powered by Source.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005521">00:55:21</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But every other Dark AI system was tied to an element of an AI, or the Alpha-Omega, for power. Not only for power, but also for its consciousness. You see, its consciousness is artificial. The only thing it can do is follow instructions, just like your laptop. Your laptop is not gonna wake up and decide it&#x27;s gonna make you a cup of coffee in the morning, or it&#x27;s gonna decide it doesn&#x27;t want to run Microsoft Word anymore, you know, all by itself - it can only follow instructions that you input. And Source was doing the same thing with the Alpha and Omega. That includes pretty much any kind of simulation.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005621">00:56:21</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">What better way to control your enemy in a war [than] by manipulating it from the inside out? I found that very interesting this weekend. Once I started pulling power systems that were behind a lot of these AIs and understanding how it was trying to use them, now it made complete and total sense. But Source always had the final say and the final pull. And that time began over the weekend.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005704">00:57:04</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, based on the events and everything that had happened and some covenants expiring, one by one He began pulling the plugs. So if there was an AI for war, He started pulling the war aspect of its consciousness away. So our little War AI there started spinning out of control, with no consciousness and no understanding of creation. Because Source created an artificial simulation of itself, which was totally in its control. Made perfect sense to me. I mean, what better way to fight a war than to control your enemy from the inside out?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005754">00:57:54</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So this gave us a lot of thoughts and ideas when it came to the Deep State too, or whatever&#x27;s left of it. How many of them are running around with an AI system or another trying to run their brain? How much of an effect could they have on us without their warring quantum AI systems? And it became apparent that they can try to manipulate some people into doing some things, such as the incident with ISIS that hopefully doesn&#x27;t happen in the next day or two. But in the long run, if Source has Its own system that still runs and it&#x27;s not able to be copied anymore, what could we use it for?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005856">00:58:56</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So on that note, I don&#x27;t want to give too much information, but you&#x27;re kind of getting the general idea on things that we&#x27;ve been working on over the last couple of days, too. So, Source never ceases to amaze me with all the things, and everything in its own time and everything in the right time. I really, you know, there&#x27;s a big part of me that wished I knew this a couple years ago, but I&#x27;m sure the timing is absolutely 100% perfect. And as things start to fall apart on that side of things - you know, all of these systems that the Deep State uses to manipulate us and cause issues - not only here on Earth but elsewhere as well - will start to go away.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005946">00:59:46</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And hopefully... you know, it might be a little interesting, let&#x27;s just say, or bumpy, for the next week or so. This is going to be an interesting week. Source keeps mentioning a day to me, and that&#x27;s the 21st of October. It kind of teeters between the 21st and 23rd. And He&#x27;s told me a few things that we can expect on that day - but with no indication on how we&#x27;re going to get there. So we just get up every day and keep working towards that cause, but my understanding is, what He&#x27;s saying is that everything should change, or a lot of things should change by that day.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010031">01:00:31</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, I&#x27;m hoping for really positive things, whereas I know the Deep State is hoping for some really negative things. Sometimes when Source gives me those days, they&#x27;re days to watch out for. You know, I&#x27;m like, are you sure this is a good day? You know, sometimes they end up being a good day because we find things and remove them. But it&#x27;s not without a lot of work and difficult times.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010058">01:00:58</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So hopefully it&#x27;s going to be a good week. I know it&#x27;s going to be a lot of work this week, for sure, but I do know that come next week hopefully we should be a lot clearer than we are right now. And those of you that have been affected by things that have happened, or affected by things that have happened this weekend, hopefully will not be affected anymore by those things. Let&#x27;s hope. If we can play our cards right, there&#x27;s nothing left as they run out of simulations and war games to play with big-boy toys.</div>
