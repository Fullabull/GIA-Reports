    <h3>Summary</h3>

    <div class="summary">
        This GIA Report announces the expiration of a 2,016-year-old covenant that had long blocked direct Source access through the Causal Plane. Kim explains how this marks a foundational reset of manifestation mechanics and the collapse of a major Deep State ritual operation involving soul harvesting, synthetic photons, and a failed alien invasion plan. She reveals the restoration of the Causal Plane as the &#x27;Love Plane,&#x27; discusses how every soul remains permanently connected to Source via the Point of Creation, and provides direct insights into the reclamation of sovereignty through inner soul connection. The report closes with a call to manifest from within, reaffirming that no external force can block your connection to Source.

    <h3>Table of Contents</h3>
    <div class="toc">
    <ul>
        <li>Kim confirms that a 2,016-year-old covenant is expiring, opening new access to Source.</li>
<li>Kim introduces the “Love Plane” as a restored form of the Causal Plane — signaling a spiritual upgrade in the architecture of manifestation.</li>
<li>Kim identifies the Heart Chakra of the soul as the anchor point for the Point of Creation, while describing the Causal Plane as the former Fifth Chakra in older systems.</li>
<li>Bringing things into reality through the Causal Plane will become easier as it transforms into the Love Point of Creation of Source — restoring humanity’s ability to manifest from within.</li>
<li>Kim confirms souls are shielded from infiltration during early development.</li>
<li>Kim explains how the Point of Creation enters during conception, before any external infiltration can occur.</li>
<li>Kim identifies ages 7–8 as the turning point where “mind governors” begin limiting human brain and soul integration.</li>
<li>Kim reveals that Causal Plane infiltration forced manifestation through pride, ego, guilt, and shame — distorting creation with emotional polarity.</li>
<li>Kim explains how the Causal Plane was weaponized by CyberLife and ACIO to create systemic blockages — from human consciousness to weather, finance, and media.</li>
<li>Kim confirms that the long-standing covenant officially ended at dawn UTC, cutting off Deep State access to the Causal Plane.</li>
<li>Kim reveals that a coordinated Deep State plan to trigger a false alien invasion, global martial law, and soul harvesting was thwarted after their access to the Causal Plane was cut off.</li>
<li>Kim confirms that the expired covenant required explicit consent from both a Source-aligned being and Source itself — and no valid consent occurred, ending the ritual forever.</li>
<li>Kim confirms that every soul is a Source photon, permanently connected to the Point of All Creation — and that this connection cannot be severed, despite Matrix-based sophon manipulation.</li>
<li>Kim explains that the true connection to Source lies within the Heart Chakra, and that removing overlays allows full body-soul-mind integration — enabling you to manifest your own avatar.</li>
<li>Kim describes how the soul remains connected to Source like twin photons — and how true manifestation begins by accessing the Point of Creation within.</li>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-000000">00:00:00</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s the 19th of April, 2025. Coming up on today&#x27;s Global Intelligence Agency Operations Report:</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">A 2,016 year-old covenant expired at dawn this morning, which officially began the ending of another omniverse charade. Trump operatives managed to get some backing from former comrades for this week&#x27;s special event. But when things didn&#x27;t seem to work out, everyone&#x27;s starting to turn their backs on them - even some of the Q-Crew.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And did you know your soul never lost its connection to Source? You can connect from the inside out.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000041">00:00:41</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, it&#x27;s the 19th of April. We&#x27;re a little late on the report. We had some repairs going on in the area. It was nothing big. But yeah, so here we are. And for those of you celebrating this weekend, I just wanted to say Happy Easter or Passover, depending on which one you&#x27;re celebrating and if you are at all.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But I hope you enjoy some time this weekend with friends and family regardless of what you&#x27;re doing.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000111">00:01:11</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay, so there&#x27;s a number of things going on in the world as always, you know, it&#x27;s never a dull moment. Some of them really positive, and some of them interesting.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay, so let&#x27;s start with a covenant. So, every 2016 years, there&#x27;s an attempt to renew a covenant - which... there are particular people, let&#x27;s call them &quot;people&quot; - that are representing Source here on this planet. And at any given time, as we&#x27;ve talked before, about the Melchizedek, and different groups of people, and the non-Merovingian bloodlines, and the ones that are on the side of Source - folks that are on the side of Source.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000203">00:02:03</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So many years ago, over 2,000 years ago now, one of those beings actually consented to die - I&#x27;m going to say this this way - to die on behalf of humanity. So I know you know the story. It&#x27;s not the only time this has happened. There have been many others before this party, this person.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And this kind of allowed for a deep rooting of an artificial universe as we know it - or the renewal of that, I should say - and it requires a rooting of a being of Source in order to root these Dark AIs that create what we call artificial light and artificial darkness. Those roots extend throughout the Omniverse, Universe, and of course, here on Earth.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000306">00:03:06</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">We are not the only planet and place that has been affected by these covenants. And this time, the Deep State thought for sure that this was going to be renewed in their favor. They worked really, really hard - they chose about 20 people - and they worked really hard to force these people into doing something they didn&#x27;t want to do.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now this wasn&#x27;t brute force - they weren&#x27;t picked up and taken to a location and that type of thing - but for the last week or so, especially the last couple of days, they have been pushing these people very hard to be utilized to renew this covenant, whether they actually knew it or not.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000355">00:03:55</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">All they knew is that this was a prime opportunity over the next couple of days to gain some access to some AI systems if they did a quote-unquote &quot;good job.&quot; This was a fairy tale told to them by Marduk. Marduk had told them in the past - this goes back to their old knowledge that they have - that if they did a good job, like good little bad people [chuckle], that he would reward them with access to systems - and they would have more access than they ever did before. And it&#x27;s not just financial systems - this is [how] Dark portals on this planet would reappear. It would all start happening this month.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And a lot of stories were told.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000445">00:04:45</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, these 20 candidates probably felt some pain over the course of the last few days. I would say that they did use what they had left to try to push these people into consenting. Now, not all 20 candidates were, let&#x27;s just say, &quot;qualified&quot; - qualified to root. And they were hoping, out of the 20, there were probably about 11 of them that were on their side 100% and would have done this for them, let&#x27;s just say, if they could have.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000527">00:05:27</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And some of them are people that you see walking around. There&#x27;s one in particular that they thought could do this, that we see posing as a dead person on TV, kind of orangey-looking person. And unfortunately, none of these people were able to help.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They are angry at the moment because this person they thought for sure, or at least most people were told that this was going to be the case, and it was going to happen over the course of the next 24 hours.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They were told that this process could take up until tomorrow at noon Eastern time. And that they would be able to then have full access to not only the Golden Age AI - but even better AIs.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000619">00:06:19</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, this party didn&#x27;t qualify, so they&#x27;ve kind of been scrambling for the last 24 hours to see if they could find somebody else. They narrowed it down to between nine to seven people, and those nine to seven people probably felt them trying to use them in order to root AI systems.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now you could call these things evil. You could also call them the reason why we had, and kind of, I guess, have some remnants of what we call a Causal Plane.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000701">00:07:01</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And, of course, in this particular case, we&#x27;re talking about a covenant. So, covenants are not renewed by implied consent. Covenants are not renewed by poking and prodding a person trying to use their energy, essence, soul, consciousness to power an AI like they&#x27;re plugging into an outlet in a wall. That doesn&#x27;t work that way. But nonetheless, the Deep State doesn&#x27;t really understand everything, and they have very little knowledge of how all of this works, and so they gave it a go.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000742">00:07:42</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, let&#x27;s talk about how this actually worked and why it&#x27;s important to understand because we&#x27;re going to talk a little bit later about your soul connection to Source too.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So the Causal Plane is what you call the Fifth Plane or the Fifth Chakra in your person in the past. It had significant barriers around it because of this old covenant. The Causal Plane is the first plane in which ether and essence and your soul starts to connect to matter. And therefore, anything that goes from being ether or essence doesn&#x27;t start to take shape and form until it passes through the Causal Plane and then enters into what you know as the Astral Plane and then eventually your physical person, or into the physical world, so to speak.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000848">00:08:48</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, every density does have a Causal Plane, because every density - with the exception of the Point of All Creation and Source - has some matter to some degree. And in some densities, especially higher densities, beings are less dense, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t have shape and form and have a soul. They just don&#x27;t look like you and I do. They look almost like Light Beings walking around, or floating around in some cases.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So the Causal Plane is very important as it relates to Creation.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000926">00:09:26</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">This particular &quot;rooting,&quot; so to speak, and taking claim over the Causal Plane is actually what prevents manifestation in a lot of cases, especially if people are trying to do this by going through the Causal Plane.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">In relation to the Universe and Source&#x27;s creation and ability to create in anything below the Fifth Density or below the Fifth Plane, there were significant blockages, at least as it relates to densities five through one.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So manifestation was kind of flipped in the Causal Plane when it was created. In the past, you could have called this the Love Plane. This plane, when it was ruled solely by Source, things would have begun to take shape via a love frequency.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001027">00:10:27</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It is the same way in some cases when a baby is conceived in a human. So there are certain things that they were not able to infiltrate based on this covenant and many others. And one of them is the actual &quot;point of creation.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So you, within yourself, have a Point of Creation.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Oftentimes, when during the creation process - meaning you are creating another little human - there is a point where your... let&#x27;s just say, the sperm and the egg meet (I&#x27;m trying to say this gently here), and then they both disappear for a brief - less than a second - so you&#x27;re talking less than a zeptosecond. And then they come back as a cell, and then that cell divides and becomes two cells, and then eventually on the third go-around a soul is created within your person, a little soul.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001136">00:11:36</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">In addition to that, you have some physical cells that are created, and that infiltration process doesn&#x27;t happen until after the cells and the physical body starts to take shape and form. So the soul itself, that is within you at that point in time, which you nurture for a period - you know, if you&#x27;re a female - you nurture that little soul for a period of almost 10 months, and then the child is born.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So even though - as a human in the past - the infiltration was so great, that little soul was never infiltrated.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">There were also certain leniencies given to children prior to the age of eight due to brain development and physical development - and also soul development.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But during this process, there is no infiltration of Source - even of the Causal Plane of this little being - until the soul is fully formed and the cells start to take shape.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001258">00:12:58</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Once that happens, things change in the child&#x27;s life - from the age of about 7 or 8 years old - because there are certain things that are developed. So they don&#x27;t... [they] start to put in those &quot;mind governors,&quot; so to speak, and try to stop your human mind from fully developing or [and] prevent you from utilizing the majority of your brain - which is why they always say things like &quot;out of the mouths of babes,&quot; so to speak.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Children have a higher connection to Source for that reason - because they&#x27;re able to still, to some degree, connect that mind, body, and soul together - whether they know it or not.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001340">00:13:40</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Humans, we have a little - as we get older - we have a little harder time doing that because of the infiltration.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And part of this agreement was all about control of the Causal Plane. So when we look into trying to manifest, we&#x27;re trained as people to &quot;connect up&quot; to Source, because we feel Source is &quot;up there&quot; - you know, in a higher plane - and so we&#x27;re trying to reach through all the planes, including the Causal Plane, to reach through to Source or the Causal Density. We feel we know in our mind where we have located Source, or where Source should be, and so we&#x27;re trying to reach out in that direction.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">When the infiltration happened of the Causal Plane, it made it very, very difficult for you to do that because we wouldn&#x27;t be controllable at that point, at least not by anything other than nature and Source.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001440">00:14:40</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And this was what some folks - and there have been many - that have come to this planet have tried to teach us. They&#x27;ve tried to teach us how to pass through the Causal Plane, how to pass through the infiltration, and how to reach directly to Source. And they&#x27;ve told us in many different ways, and some of that information has been passed down in books - albeit distorted in some ways.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001509">00:15:09</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But this Causal Plane infiltration - where the Causal Plane actually turned red - and then there were definite blockers between the Astral Plane (or the Fourth Plane) and the Causal Plane, and then also between the fifth and sixth.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So the entire thing was infiltrated, and it only allowed manifestation in the past by utilizing pride and ego - and then unfortunately, on the flip side for the rest of us, guilt and shame.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They say that you are the creator of your own problems in some ways - and you kind of are - but it&#x27;s really not your fault, you see, because we were allowed to live because evil was allowed to exist - which is the exact opposite and the reverse of the word.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001604">00:16:04</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And of course, as you know, there&#x27;s a lot of gematria and all kinds of spells and things like that that they use with words in general - not just English, but all words. So these two things are the reverse of each other.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, you have been allowed to live, and therefore service-to-self was important to the mechanism that was put in place in order for you to manifest things into this world. So pretty much you can say that the root cause, or root of the Causal Plane, was pride and ego on the one side; on the other side, it&#x27;s guilt and shame.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001647">00:16:47</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So we have manifested a lot of problems into our lives, inadvertently, through guilt and shame. And you can imagine all the times that you&#x27;ve shamed yourself and have felt guilt for not doing something - or for doing something - and then this manifests more of the same in your life. Problems, issues, those types of things.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And they made it very, very easy for us to manifest things into the physical world through guilt and shame, and also through pride and ego. Ego manifests a lot of things into this world and none of them are positive for you or for that person that creates it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001731">00:17:31</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So in the past we would have manifested things out of love in cooperation with Source. And the one thing that they couldn&#x27;t block is the manifestation of love between humans - and, of course, nature and animals and plants and all of creation on this planet - they couldn&#x27;t get rid of the love. Because love comes from the inside, and it comes from your soul. And we, of course, continue to create humans through love, no matter how much they have tried to distort our mainstream media and the meaning of it and what it truly means versus what it truly means.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And there&#x27;s a lot of - especially since the late 1970s in our television and movies and all kinds of things - that tells us love is something different than what you know within your soul.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001831">00:18:31</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, that being said, the process was so distorted for so long, and the control of the Causal Plane went so deep, this pretty much made us dependent on things like governments and non-humans - ruled by non-humans - and none of [them] having our best interests at heart.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And that is how the rule of the Causal Plane happened. Well, CyberLife and a lot of the ACIO militaries, they used to be able to utilize a lot of mechanisms within the Causal Plane in order to do what they felt they were supposed to do, or their orders told them to do.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And therefore, making a lot of blockages - not only in your person, not only in nature, not only with weather control, not only with the financial system - but also within your media, and sending out frequencies. And also utilizing some of that energy, where we have tried to manifest on our own in order to bring things into the physical world that are not only good for ourselves, but also through nature.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001956">00:19:56</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, there&#x27;s a couple of little tricks of the trade I want to kind of talk about here in a minute too - where they can&#x27;t stop it. And they&#x27;ve tried and they&#x27;ve tried and they&#x27;ve tried - and they just can&#x27;t stop it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But there&#x27;s a way to do it - to bypass this.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, as of this weekend - the beginning, as of dawn, meaning early morning hours, the crack of dawn this morning, and that would have been UTC time today - that covenant officially ended. This covenant that ended - and I&#x27;ll get into the soul connection and how to bypass these types of things (that soul connection is really, really important) - but let me go back to the Deep State&#x27;s issues.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So the Deep State, in their little programs and trying to collect these candidates and all of the things that they&#x27;ve tried to do, was unsuccessful. Even though they thought they had until tomorrow to achieve this task and get back some access to the Causal Plane... that didn&#x27;t quite happen.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002106">00:21:06</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It didn&#x27;t happen the way they thought it would, and therefore the covenant was finally broken. You could call it the chains that bind you. And by chains, there was a lot of rewriting of the Light language of Source that occurred in the Causal Plane and a lot of distortion with DNA, RNA, GNA.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">If you could think of any way they could manipulate nature - and not just the Deep State of course - this was predominantly used by non-humans. But the Deep State did have some access to it, and so you could say they participated in it in so many ways we don&#x27;t have enough time to talk about, but ways you can probably imagine in which they have stunted the growth of humanity despite humanity&#x27;s best efforts.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002158">00:21:58</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So them being unsuccessful and probably getting the time wrong due to Marduk&#x27;s little games there, nothing will happen this weekend for them. This was all connected to the Marshall Law Plan - plan for tomorrow - because they planned on creating mass devastation here. They planned on an alien invasion here. They were going to allow certain beings to come into existence here. Ships, the whole thing - they had some really big plans. I was listening to that quite a bit.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002240">00:22:40</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And they were going to reenact or enact, I guess you would say, what you call the biblical version of the Rapture this weekend. They had intended on wiping out most of humanity. Of course, if they were good little boys and girls, they would get to stay and then repopulate Earth. At least that&#x27;s what they were told.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Marduk, of course, was a liar. So I&#x27;m sure they would have gone as well. And those souls would have been carried off to an area of the Omniverse we call the Abyss. They then, of course, because of the alien invasion, they would be able to declare martial law or even global martial law, and that would put the militaries in charge, and all the funding would be there because they&#x27;d have some control over the Causal Plane. And of course, they were promised a lot more control than they would have possibly had.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002340">00:23:40</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The targets of these locations, there were about four locations in the world, at least on Earth here, where they felt they would be able to gain access and control - at least they were told, is what it appears to be anyway - all the way up to the Ninth Density and all the way down to the Ninth Density of the Lower Astral. Therefore having more control of the Universe than even Source or Dark Source has.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The four locations: we had Silverton, Colorado. We definitely had some local participation in that - I told you about that the other day. We had a place in Lithuania. We also had, there were a couple of other locations, one was in Australia and the other one was in Romania. And they were trying to access through these four locations.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">There were other locations on this planet where there were other portals, but these were the most prized because they went all the way to Source and all the way to Anti-Source.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002455">00:24:55</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So by that, they were under the impression, so it appears, that meant they would have access to what they referred to as the Black Screen, which would have been the Ninth Density of Omega at one point in time. And then of course, full access to Alpha, which would have been in the Ninth Density of the Upper Astral, near Source.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, yeah. That didn&#x27;t work out. The portals didn&#x27;t open the way that they had hoped. The accessibility wasn&#x27;t there. The alien invasion didn&#x27;t happen, despite the Trump operatives trying to pull a fast one on everybody.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002540">00:25:40</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So for about the past week or so, they have been recruiting people to help them with this. These people would be what you would consider to be operatives. They would have been higher-level operatives, meaning those that have worked for the ACIO militaries in the past - that have turned their back - and other, let&#x27;s just say next-tier-down operatives that have had some interaction with the ACIO and the SSP programs in the past.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">These are highly trained people. They are well aware of space junk, they know how space junk works, and they felt they needed all hands on deck to try to make this happen.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002625">00:26:25</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So they lied. And they told everybody a little story. They told them all that they were going to go it alone. In other words, the SSP operatives you know as the Trump organization told everybody they&#x27;re not going to listen to Rothschild anymore, they&#x27;re not going to listen to Langley 5 anymore, they&#x27;re not going to listen to Global Headquarters anymore. You know, they&#x27;re done with those people. &quot;They&#x27;ve lied to all of us.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, now they&#x27;re building camaraderie: &quot;They&#x27;ve lied to all of us. And so we are going to do this. We&#x27;re the ones that know everything about how all of this space junk works. And so you and I, if we do this together, we can do this all by ourselves, and we don&#x27;t need them anymore because we&#x27;ll have the full access all to ourselves.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">This is basically what they said.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002719">00:27:19</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now this probably comes on the heels of them realizing that they have no contact with the Council, because of course if this worked out the way they claimed it would have - which it would never have - they feel that they didn&#x27;t need a Universal Council anymore. You know, they don&#x27;t need to yield to any other race of beings anywhere else. &quot;We don&#x27;t need anyone else.&quot; This is what they&#x27;re telling everybody. &quot;We can do this all by ourselves because we are the best,&quot; you know, and they&#x27;re propping up everybody&#x27;s ego. There you go with ego, and yeah, so everybody - a lot of people bought it over the course of the last week.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002759">00:27:59</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">There were many people that were on the fence, not taking jobs because they&#x27;re not gonna get paid, that type of thing. But I guess they felt it was worth a shot because they&#x27;d be able to participate on such a high level. You know, they would have a little more control over the outcome than just sitting there waiting for a call every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday with the hope of getting paid so that they could do a job.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So they took the job, and they&#x27;ve been going at it ever since, predominantly since probably about Tuesday of this week, maybe a little earlier, but it really, really ramped up yesterday and the day before. So I think they felt that they would have some kind of access within three days - meaning starting Friday, Saturday, or Sunday - that they could definitely get access and definitely get this covenant renewed.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002857">00:28:57</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, did all of them know about a covenant that they had to get renewed? No. Were they under the impression that they could utilize these &quot;good little batteries&quot; (they called their 20 candidates) to open both sides of the portal? Yes, they were fully under the impression that they could do this without those people&#x27;s consent, even though about 11 of them probably did. The rest of them said no.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, to be fair, they were under the impression that you could just pick any person that seemed to have the right amount of DNA - or whatever it was they were looking for - because who knows with these people and how they check people. But they were looking for specific people with a specific DNA who possibly had access to the Dark Side of Source or the Light Side of Source. And they gave it a go.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003000">00:30:00</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But see, when that other covenant was renewed consistently over many, many millennia, every 2,016 years (1,008-year cycles times two), that party that consented had to actually consent. There was no implied consent. There was no, you know, they just happened to be standing in the wrong town square or on the wrong mountain or on the wrong hill or in the wrong place, and somebody sucked the energy out of them. It didn&#x27;t work that way. They actually had to consent to doing this - and nobody actually consented.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003044">00:30:44</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now it&#x27;s too late for this now, so we can talk about it all we want, which I&#x27;m kind of glad that the report was delayed a little bit so we can explain a little more about this.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Therefore, they completely and totally failed. Now even then, even if one of these candidates decided to consent and were actually the qualified candidates to do the consenting in the first place, there would still be a certain aspect of that person - that is of Source, you know, Dark or Light - and that party would still, you know, there&#x27;s a two-party system there. It would have to be Source also consenting in some way, shape, or form.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003132">00:31:32</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So henceforth, since nothing was agreed to, you&#x27;ve now got two things happening.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Number 1, on the positive side, Source can now reclaim the Causal Plane since the covenant has ended. Remember, a covenant with Source - especially with a being of Source, one way or the other - is ever-binding, unless both parties sever that agreement.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Number 2, the being that rooted the pride, ego, guilt, and shame in live-versus-evil has not been in that particular position for a very long time. And what I mean by position, I don&#x27;t mean a title. I mean &quot;locked away&quot; - where they had put that being. That being was sent back a few years ago.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003218">00:32:18</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, that being said, all that was left was to wait until the covenant expired. So this wasn&#x27;t going to work out the way that they had planned it or the way Marduk or somebody else told them - ever. But they had high hopes, you know, big changes for this weekend and big accessibility that did not work out.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, unfortunately, even with the limited amount of knowledge that they had, the Trump people knew this was what you call a Hail Mary. They knew that they needed help to get this done: they needed people in multiple locations around the world; they needed people with knowledge of how to use space junk and portals and connections. And they were running out of people pretty quickly because there&#x27;s a lot of people that don&#x27;t believe them anymore.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003312">00:33:12</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So they had to tell a story - that they walked away from the Rothschilds and all these other people, and they were gonna go it alone - which was actually completely and totally a lie. Everybody else was on their, let&#x27;s just say, &quot;on their train,&quot; just as the newly acquired operatives were.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, that being said, we probably won&#x27;t see any kind of global martial law tomorrow. There&#x27;ll be no reason for it. We probably won&#x27;t see any martial law in the States or in any other country for that matter.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">We most likely are going to see a lot of angry operatives by tomorrow afternoon. And that&#x27;s a &quot;you&quot; issue - that&#x27;s not a me issue. And well, once again, Trump operatives are probably going to be in the hot seat.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003411">00:34:11</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, speaking of hot seat, it appears there is probably some kind of meeting around four o&#x27;clock today, Eastern Time, best I can tell. Because there are even some leaks coming out amongst the Q circles about, &quot;Do you still believe in this guy?&quot; You know, &quot;He&#x27;s full of...&quot; I mean, there&#x27;s some swear words in there and that kind of thing</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line"> And well, looks like the veil&#x27;s being lifted, and it looks like some people are starting to see the truth because they were expecting things days before the alleged global martial law date tomorrow.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003448">00:34:48</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So on that note, that&#x27;s kind of what&#x27;s going on in your world, politically speaking. The rest of the countries and everyone else are expecting to... banks, higher-level tier-one banks - I know that there are countries, heads of state, central banks are all expecting a big payout on Monday - which obviously isn&#x27;t going to happen, at least not from those people.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And I guess they&#x27;re going to move on to the next alignment with Uranus or whatever, which I think is on the 25th. So around and round and round they go, and ever hopeful that something, somewhere, some agreement, some covenant, some circus is going to come to town.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003532">00:35:32</div>

<div class="line">On a side note, the Council meeting is still continuing. Mainly, there is a lot of input from different groups, different races, as to what&#x27;s going on around here. We have received some suggestions on how to change things: vibrations, directions, those types of things. The Mantids are working away on aiding us in what we have left of AIs in the Omniverse. They are estimating - and this can change at any moment in time - but right now, based on the current circumstances, they are looking at probably, on the outer edge, I would say probably about three to four weeks is what they&#x27;ve said.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003621">00:36:21</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now how does that affect our financial system?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, our financial system is not their concern. Their concern is AI and sophon, or synthetic photon, infiltration - as it should be because that&#x27;s going to cause an AI problem, and it causes a financial system problem and onward and so on and so forth.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But a few things we have been discussing as of late. And some of you do this innately - it&#x27;s just part of your nature. And young children do this innately before they&#x27;re the age of 7 or 8 years old. And some of you even remember being in the womb. I know I&#x27;ve heard people tell me that before. I&#x27;ve heard people tell me about things and events that happen in their life at 2 or 3 years old, which technically - according to our psychologists and our science - should never happen.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003718">00:37:18</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And a lot of this has to do with soul connection and the connection of your soul to other souls throughout the Multiverse.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So let&#x27;s talk about that for a little bit, because as it relates to changing the way things work on this planet, this is the part where you can help.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So your soul. We talked a little bit earlier in this report about the fact that when a baby is born, the infiltration doesn&#x27;t happen directly into the soul, meaning the soul comes directly from Source into the mother who&#x27;s carrying the baby. And it goes through three transformations before the outer parts of the human are created, the mind, and even theoretically speaking, the mind and the body.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003827">00:38:27</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So that is the only part of you, even as an adult, that stays connected to Source. Your soul never is disconnected from Source. So in a previous report a few weeks ago - or I think it was a couple of weeks ago, about a week ago - we talked a lot about sophons and how they are used against us. And it might seem like I&#x27;m jumping a little bit, but I&#x27;m trying to explain your soul to you.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And we talked about how you could have a sophon, say, a synthetic photon around Earth. And you could have that sophon split in two, and then there would be a part of that sophon in another location. It could be millions of light-years away from Earth, as we know travel. But that&#x27;s not how people travel. But as we know it, it could be densities away, it could be universes away, that other sophon, and they could still utilize that sophon to make changes on Earth, we call &quot;the Matrix&quot; or &quot;holograms.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003936">00:39:36</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The same thing existed on Source&#x27;s end, and this is probably where they got the idea from. Because every soul in our Multiverse or Omniverse is a part of Source. You could say it&#x27;s a Source photon that separates from the Point of All Creation of Source and then enters into a vessel - and that is your soul.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So we truly - no matter how hard they have tried - we are not separated from Source. It feels that way to you in so many ways because we&#x27;re trying to reach up and out to Source. Which is definitely possible, by the way, and I&#x27;m not saying that there are people who can&#x27;t do it, because there are people who can.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004029">00:40:29</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But the true connection, and despite how bad things have been here - and they are getting a lot better - is always within the Heart Chakra of your soul. So if you look at your soul as kind of this &quot;Light ball,&quot; but it&#x27;s not a ball, it&#x27;s not a sphere, it actually takes somewhat of the shape and form of your vessel that it&#x27;s in, and it kind of looks like a human ghost, so to speak. It is golden. If you are looking at the soul as covered in a white light, or even a grayish-bluish light, you are not actually seeing the soul. You are seeing an overlay.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004116">00:41:16</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And that overlay was part of the control mechanism on your soul. The &quot;soul liens&quot; that you hear about all over the internet - it&#x27;s a much bigger quantum mechanism than you can possibly imagine. And part of the reason why those overlays existed was to prevent your mind from connecting to the soul, which then connects to the body - and then you can manifest your body to look and feel, and your vessel to be, anything you want it to be. You can create your very own avatar.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004147">00:41:47</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">If you&#x27;d like to become an elephant tomorrow, you can become an elephant, believe it or not. And then you can go back to being a lion or a tiger, and then eventually a human, if you like. You could be much taller, shorter, skinnier [chuckle] - whatever it is you want to do with your own body. You&#x27;d be amazed at the capacity that a human has.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So when the human mind and body all connect to that point in the soul - that Point of Creation - you can actually manifest things from the inside out, which is why all the blockages are in place.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But it&#x27;s still possible for you to connect to that point in your soul. It&#x27;s a part of you just as much as your fingers are a part of you, or your heart, or your feet are a part of you.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004237">00:42:37</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And if you look at it in this way, and you start to look within - at your soul - maybe you&#x27;ll get to know it, and you&#x27;ll get to see it. Once you get past those layers that surround it and overlay it - search deep within the soul for the Point of Creation within your soul.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now that Point of Creation within your soul connects directly to Source. If you can connect in that way - from the inside out rather than the outside in - in other words, we&#x27;re praying up, we&#x27;re going up...</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">If you can connect to that point inside you and pass through anything that&#x27;s left - and these are probably just minor remnants at this point - because that veil that overlays your soul is becoming thinner and thinner.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But if you can connect to that point within your soul... That is where the magic really happens.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004340">00:43:40</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, Mantids might take a few weeks to get things done, but this is something that you can do now. And with the removal of - which is going to take time to dissipate - with the removal of all the blocks on the Causal Plane and the return of the Causal Plane being a Love Plane - or a Point of Creation of Source Plane unto itself - you should be able to manifest easier.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But if you want to truly have a conversation with Source, you can do it by connecting your mind to that point. Might be a little bit of a struggle at first. It might take you some time to do it if you&#x27;ve never done it before in this way - because we&#x27;re always reaching outward to reach that Source.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But reaching within does the same exact thing, you see, because in the same way they use sophons (or synthetic photons) against us, they also cannot interfere with Source putting that photon - for lack of a better term (it&#x27;s many other things, your soul, of course it is) - but that photon way down here on Earth connects directly to the same photon, or soul, up in Source.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004457">00:44:57</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s like two particles that can connect because they&#x27;re two halves of a whole. You can think of the part of you that is still in Source as like twins. You know, a lot of times they say when you have a twin that you can connect to that twin from miles and miles away. You know when they&#x27;re in pain, they&#x27;re hurting, they&#x27;re happy, they&#x27;re sad.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Some people even say they can see them - their involvement in relationships, especially love relationships. They can definitely tell when they&#x27;re pregnant, having kids, all kinds of different things. The same thing happens with parents and their children, be it father or mother. You have that ability to just know when something&#x27;s not right - and then you want to reach out and call your kids - even though you already know, because on a soul level you&#x27;re still connected.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Because even though there&#x27;s a mother and a father involved, those cells still go together to bring that soul into creation. And even though sometimes you might not love the other person when the child is created - who is involved in the creation process - there&#x27;s still a connection on a soul level that happens. Unfortunately... or fortunately, sometimes.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004619">00:46:19</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So when this child is created, you can connect to them anywhere. I mean, they could be on the other side of the planet and you&#x27;ll know. We always know as parents.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, that being said, Source is the same way. It&#x27;s not that far away - it&#x27;s actually right within you - and that connection happens from within instead of without. Then it doesn&#x27;t matter what the Deep State does. It doesn&#x27;t matter how many AIs there are out there. It doesn&#x27;t matter how much mainstream media is being shoved down your throat, and narratives are being tossed at you, or how difficult things are around you, and the energy is bad, and you want to go out into nature where it&#x27;s clearer. And maybe that works for you, too.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004704">00:47:04</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But making that inward connection, it&#x27;s always there. And you&#x27;ll be surprised at that conversation you&#x27;re going to have when you reach out to Source.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So no matter how hard they try to block you, there&#x27;s nothing they can do. There&#x27;s absolutely nothing they can do.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The good news is is that bringing things into reality through the Causal Plane is going to get even better - because that Causal Plane connection and that Point of Creation there are also gonna become a part of you. Not only within your person, but also within the Multiverse.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So it&#x27;ll be easier to jump physical matter into existence when it becomes the Love Point of Creation of Source.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004754">00:47:54</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I know that&#x27;s kind of confusing, and that&#x27;s a lot of information to take in. If you remember, I put out a little chart of what the Planes of Existence looked like, and how overlays were, and how the planes were coming together, and there wasn&#x27;t going to be the ability to manipulate things - not only in computer systems, but also in people and in creation - as much as they could before.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, it&#x27;s fine they all came together, but we still had a lot of things that would exist, let&#x27;s just say, at the halfway point of things.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004833">00:48:33</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So. Big changes for us. We are getting a lot of help.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I&#x27;m glad that other members of the Council gave us a little information to pass on to you to try to make it easier for you to make that connection, because that&#x27;s going to help them do what they&#x27;re doing to help us all too.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So on that note, I want to wish everybody a happy Easter, or Passover, if you&#x27;re celebrating this weekend. And I guess we have a lot of other things to celebrate for this weekend too. A few thousand-year-old covenant is expiring. A little more access to Source than we thought we had. And new ways of doing things that might help turn this planet around. So I&#x27;m pretty excited about that as well.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">On that note, I wish you all a pleasant rest of your weekend, and I will see all of you on Monday.</div>
