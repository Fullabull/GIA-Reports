    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <div class="summary">
        Crypto operatives push a stablecoin scheme worldwide while chasing off-ledger heritage money and fake allocation numbers. A South Korean medal moment becomes PR for a planned Halloween coronation as a White House ballroom basement is outfitted like a Third Temple of Solomon, including an altar. Attempts to issue colossal Treasury notes fail after allocation numbers were replaced by the Key Integrated Master System and Golden Age AI. Backdoors, SIGINT links, and ECHELON ties are dismantled, point-of-sale integration proves impossible, and the currency rollout is pushed past Oct 31 and Nov 4. Source currents rise as Halls between the Planes of Existence are destroyed and timer systems are neutralized; the old simulation scripts no longer bite. The currents of Planet Earth are flowing in our direction.

<div class="line">It&#x27;s the 29th of October, 2025. Coming up on today&#x27;s Global Intelligence Agency Operations Report:</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The Deep State focuses on cryptocurrency spearheaded by the U.S. Treasury. We have inside information as to the plan, and all the deals made as well, and all the issues they&#x27;ve had.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">What&#x27;s the big deal about the ballroom that is being added on to the White House? After talking with a contractor who is on the job, you&#x27;ll be shocked at what they had to say.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And lots of positive changes are happening on our end, as the currents of planet Earth are flowing in our direction.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000044">00:00:44</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">[Advertisement.]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000118">00:01:18</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, it&#x27;s the 29th of October; we are almost through October and heading into November. I don&#x27;t know where this year went; it&#x27;s gone by pretty quickly, at least for me. And always busy.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So lots of stuff has been going on for the last several days, both in the public eye and outside of the public eye, and I thought we&#x27;d talk about a little bit of regular news first and how that relates to what we&#x27;ve been up to.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000151">00:01:51</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay, so we know that Trump has been traveling throughout Asia and is now in North Korea [South Korea] for the APEC conference, which began, or is due to begin, this weekend. Now, behind the scenes, there have been a lot of promises made and a lot of fear going around for those who do not adhere to what this administration wants. And that has nothing to do with just the United States; this is every country everywhere, and deals are being made all over the place. And there&#x27;s little public disclosure about these deals. So let&#x27;s take a look at this video real quick.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000239">00:02:39</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">South Korea Rep: We present you with this medal with our deepest appreciation.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Trump: Thank you very much. [...] I&#x27;m going to remain here for the rest of the week. I will always cherish it. That&#x27;s special.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">S.K. President: When we did the magic, we took a long time on... [unclear].</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Presenter: The people of Korea are awarding you this medal with their deep appreciation.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Trump: Thank you very much. It&#x27;s a great honor. We&#x27;re going to keep it very good. And Korea is very special. We have a very great relationship, and it will continue and only get stronger. Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000332">00:03:32</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So in this video here - in case you didn&#x27;t quite catch that, we just posted a little clip of it - Trump is awarded a crown from North Korea. I&#x27;m sorry, not North Korea, South Korea - and a medal for negotiating peace between North and South Korea. [Hearty chuckle.]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">There are a lot of countries out there now who would like to give, and have given, Trump a proverbial crown over the last several days. And that&#x27;s all, of course, based on promises that he&#x27;s making all over the world.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000412">00:04:12</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You see, there are many, many conversations going on with various Asian leaders regarding stablecoin and cryptocurrency. They&#x27;ve been - he has been telling (and we have intercepted some of those conversations), but he has been telling people, or heads of state and other Family members, that he is going to be crowned [hearty laugh] - I have to laugh - King of Earth? King Solomon? I&#x27;m not sure - but he&#x27;s going to be king.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000451">00:04:51</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">If you remember, in our last report we were talking about the Asian woman who thought she was going to be holding a position, and that didn&#x27;t quite work out for that woman. Well, of course, some egotistical group of Trump operatives have decided that this is a good idea; that they will now take over. And this is more of that tit-for-tat that&#x27;s been going on for a couple of years. You know, it&#x27;s like musical chairs of the Elite, where one fails and another one steps up and says that they can do the job. And Trump - or whatever that is these days - is no exception, as he has rotated in and out of the seats of musical chairs now for quite a while, based on things that he&#x27;s done in the past, which he really didn&#x27;t even do, as we talked about in our last report. You know, most of those things were done by us. And we are not supporting, in any way, this crypto movement.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000547">00:05:47</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So more on this crypto movement: the chatter isn&#x27;t just between heads of state and the Trump administration about crypto again. And I say &quot;again&quot; because this has been going on now for a long, long time. Now, as for South Korea - let&#x27;s continue on with that behind the scenes - there are family members of the Lee family there in South Korea that are the matriarch of South Korea. They are definitely members of the Order of the Dragon Family and whatever this lady thought that she was going to be appointed to the other day. And they have been promising - and have traveled to the United States in the last year - promising a $350 billion investment to the United States.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000643">00:06:43</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">However, unfortunately, it is &quot;heritage money,&quot; which means that it is an off-ledger account they think they still have somewhere - that one day, at Wells Fargo Bank, they&#x27;re going to be able to cash this lovely account in. That day has come and gone. Compliance members that I have spoken to personally at Wells Fargo Bank have told me that they are unable to do so because they do not have the key codes. But I can tell you, for a crown and some strange medal of honor - the Mungwanga crown from South Korea (probably saying that wrong, but it&#x27;s too funny not to say it at this point) - because Trump is going to help them get their family heritage money back. And he&#x27;s planning on doing this on Halloween, or the end of October, because All Hallows&#x27; Eve is tomorrow night, and they are already starting their ceremonies all around the world in order to make this happen. At which time, the following day, on Halloween, that is when he is planning on being crowned by some AI system somewhere.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000809">00:08:09</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">To further add to that cause, the Global Headquarters folks and the Secret Space Program folks were in Kandahar yesterday trying to plead to some hologram somewhere for this position, apparently. They would like to also reconnect it to some systems of theirs that are missing. So they were in negotiations until the hologram went offline, and apparently that conversation ended abruptly. So, crazy times, but there is always something behind everything you see in the news. Right now, the APEC meeting in the mainstream media looks like it&#x27;s a lot of pomp and stance. Everybody is bowing to King Trump because he is going to be successful.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But it doesn&#x27;t look that way behind the scenes at all. And I&#x27;ll tell you exactly what&#x27;s going on - not fluff and stuff like the Trump people.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000914">00:09:14</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay, interesting other occurrences about cryptocurrency, stablecoin, and this new financial system that they think they&#x27;re going to launch. There was a conference in Las Vegas this week; it started over the weekend and continued on through Monday. And that conference was a normal IT conference. For those of you that don&#x27;t know, that are not from America, there are a lot of conferences held, and these are usually very large conferences that are held each year for varying reasons in Las Vegas. Las Vegas is one of the top conference centers that we have here in the States, along with other major cities. But there&#x27;s always some type of conference going on in Vegas.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001005">00:10:05</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So this week, the conference is for IT professionals, so there are a lot of people who attend this conference looking for new software, new technologies, these types of things. Most of the IT professionals are in varying IT-type work. Some of that work might have to do with banking or point-of-sale systems - setting up point-of-sale systems, you know, where you swipe your card when you go to the store, that kind of thing. And this is just their job. I mean, they&#x27;re just normal, regular people.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001047">00:10:47</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But I had a friend who attended this conference on Monday, hoping to take part in one of the keynote speakers&#x27; lectures there. The lecture she was to attend had nothing to do with cryptocurrency or AI; it had to do with some technology that could be helpful in some work that she&#x27;s currently doing, which has nothing to do with cryptocurrency.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So she gets to the conference - or at least this keynote-speaker section of the conference - and this guy, whatever he was going to talk about, the topic was completely pushed aside and they jumped in and started talking about AI and cryptocurrency. She was a little bit upset because this is her job, and she wanted to hear about this particular company&#x27;s software because she thought it might be helpful for a client.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001150">00:11:50</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Then, she obviously left that particular speech because she&#x27;s not interested in any way in crypto or AI, and she knows enough to know that it&#x27;s not, you know, there&#x27;s something wrong there. She proceeds to go to other booths, walk around the conference, and she started noticing that there were Treasury people there, and banks there, and parliament members, and congress members from varying countries around the world. Lots of politicians, political aides - all attending this conference, which is very unusual. And she&#x27;s attended this conference annually for quite a long time now - this is her job, she lives in the area, so this was highly unusual.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001242">00:12:42</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">She witnessed several companies talk about the fact that they can take all your country&#x27;s money at any given moment in time and put it back, and this is how this technology works, and they tried to convince everybody that blockchain is highly secure - which it is not, it&#x27;s full of holes, it&#x27;s like Swiss cheese - and that they need to, or must, install this blockchain technology and stablecoin into their country.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001318">00:13:18</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">She said that she overheard a conversation between J.P. Morgan Bank and some other attendees whereby they were all trying to get everyone to sign on to some agreement being put forward by the Trump administration regarding stablecoin. Of course, there was some fundraising going on as well there at this little conference in Las Vegas. You know, it&#x27;s just interesting to see how desperate these people are to install stablecoin.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001357">00:13:57</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, for those of you that don&#x27;t know, the Trump administration is trying to install stablecoin as almost, you could say, a replacement for the U.S. dollar - or at minimum, allow for a one-to-one exchange to stablecoin. By a &quot;one-to-one exchange,&quot; that means you can exchange one U.S. dollar for one stablecoin. There has also been talk about allowing other countries to take part in a basket of currencies, which would then back stablecoin.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001437">00:14:37</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, they&#x27;ve been trying various schemes behind the scenes here as it relates to cryptocurrency over the last week or so. So let&#x27;s talk about schemes [chuckle]. They&#x27;ve been trying to get enough cash - because in order to exchange something on a one-to-one ratio, you must have the other one. I mean, we know that the NSA can make a stablecoin be valued at whatever they want. We know that they can make as many stablecoins as they want because it&#x27;s an NSA- and DARPA-run program.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001522">00:15:22</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">However, in order to exchange one-to-one to the U.S. dollar, you have to limit yourself to a few things:</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Number 1: the amount of U.S. dollars in circulation.</div>
<div class="line">Number 2: those have to be under your custody.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And remember, [as of] quite a while ago, banks do not have custody of the dollars that they have on deposit. The same goes for central banks at this point - if that dollar is in your bank account, it is your dollar.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So then, they tried to install (or cash in) some fake Super Notes with allocation numbers. They also pulled many old allocation numbers - both on the front end and on the back end of the banking system - from the Federal Reserve, claiming that this would work. So they&#x27;re gonna register, or re-register, these allocation numbers to the system.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001628">00:16:28</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, just to give you a brief background here: when a dollar shows up on your bank account as a digital dollar, you see it as one dollar or ten dollars. However, what is behind that one dollar that&#x27;s in your bank account - or peso, or RMB - is an allocation number. Now, there are allocation numbers on dollar bills, and there are also allocation numbers that are digital. In fact, there is more than one allocation number behind that one dollar that&#x27;s in your bank account.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">In fact, there are nine allocation numbers that run through varying systems, from a quantum AI system all the way down to your bank account, where you just see the dollar. There is also a backside system to the banking system that is encrypted, and it&#x27;s encrypted nine times over.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001737">00:17:37</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, allocation numbers, your bank account number, your name, and your address are not in the same language as they travel through the levels of the banking system. On a quantum level, it is written in very odd and strange symbols that even the Deep State doesn&#x27;t have access to - and has never had access to - to change that language. They see things in numbers, on the level that they have access to. Those numbers equate to a frequency. They also see things in binary code, and then they see things in actual computer language - like JavaScript and Python and these types of things. So they don&#x27;t actually have access to some of those base root languages that are behind those languages.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001834">00:18:34</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And for that reason, when they tried to enter in all these old allocation numbers that they screen-scraped from the Fed, and other numbers that would come through - you see, the Federal Reserve is only on a Level 6 in the banking system. There are three other language levels that existed beyond the Federal Reserve. And it&#x27;s all on that level. It was always about, in the past, energy exchange. Energy exchanges are tied to covenants that are not written in any language known to mankind, for lack of a better term.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001916">00:19:16</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, they made a strong attempt to try to enter these allocation numbers into the system, and the system rejected it. It basically said these are not valid allocation numbers, and that is not a valid &quot;note,&quot; so to speak. And by not a valid &quot;note&quot; - yes, what they&#x27;re doing is a scam. You know, you can&#x27;t go back to 1938 and try to get some allocation numbers and re-enter them in the system because they think that they&#x27;re not in the system anymore. So why not use the ones from 1938? [Hearty laugh.] I have to laugh because this is funny because, you see, we&#x27;re always a step ahead of the slow people there that think that they&#x27;re going to pull one over on the world. So they try to enter these numbers in there - and it fails.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002014">00:20:14</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So now they&#x27;ve decided, in order to make this one-to-one cryptocurrency thing work in the numbers that they need - now, you&#x27;re talking hundreds of trillions of dollars, is what they quote-unquote &quot;need&quot; - they started calling us. Here. Yep, yep. We got calls from many countries around the world. It was like a... you know those commercials you see - at least we have them here in America - where the sad puppies are crying in the shelter and they say, &quot;Could you please just donate one dollar to save a sad puppy?&quot; and they play these sad songs? Well, this is kind of what my life was like for about 24 hours, because we were getting calls from Asia, Asian countries, including South Korea, we got calls from America, we&#x27;ve gotten calls from many, many places, all in the span of about 24 hours. It was either me or Thomas Melville that received the calls.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002121">00:21:21</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And it was all about, can we just issue a little bit of currency? &quot;We want to work things out. We&#x27;ve decided we want to work with you.&quot; And I don&#x27;t know if they think I was born yesterday, but I&#x27;m not. So one of the calls - I&#x27;ll tell you kind of how this sad commercial went to have Deep State people trying to sell themselves to us - the Treasury calls, and they wanted us to pay the SNAP bill to save people from starving because by next month they&#x27;re not going to be able to continue this program.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002157">00:21:57</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">For those of you outside the United States, our SNAP benefit program is a program that is in part funded by the federal government at about 50 percent and by state government for the other 50 percent. The SNAP program is equivalent to a food subsidy program, whereby qualified recipients, low-income recipients, are able to receive food benefits in order to help them feed themselves, their families, their children. And a lot of people do participate in this. It was much larger, obviously, during lockdowns and a few years ago than it is today. But there are a lot of people who depend on the program.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002249">00:22:49</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean you&#x27;re unemployed or even on state assistance, although a lot of the people are - either on Social Security or Disability or other federal programs that receive these benefits. But it&#x27;s also afforded to people who are working and maybe have children, and they don&#x27;t make enough money to support their family, and they are below the poverty line, whatever that poverty line is in any particular state - because it&#x27;s a state-by-state thing. So most likely you have a similar program in another country where you&#x27;re listening.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002330">00:23:30</div>
<br>

<div class="line">So, here in America, our SNAP program and all of the benefit cards run through a company called FISERV. And FISERV is a very large company. Most of them run on the Atlanta, Georgia, global rails. They also handle all of the Social Security direct deposits, a lot of the veterans&#x27; money direct deposits, and other government-type subsidy programs - direct deposits that go to the average everyday consumer. Most of this money is filtered - and I&#x27;m going to say filtered - through the Treasury Department for said program, although I think it is sponsored by the Ways and Means Committee, who usually handles a lot of the social programs afforded to citizens by the federal government and state governments, such as health insurance for low-income persons in the country.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002438">00:24:38</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So the Treasury Department tried to sell me on the fact that I need to pay this bill. All they really need is allocation numbers. And of course, if I were to open up the system and send out some allocation numbers, it would probably not work well, because all I would have then is a bunch of people trying to track back where they came from - and then try to steal the currency or steal the allocation numbers, like they did in Santander Bank a few years ago. See, these people have a very short memory, because I remember exactly what it is they do.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002518">00:25:18</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, the SNAP program, Social Security, and other programs have been funded utilizing IOUs from the Treasury Department to varying banks, and then off to FISERV every single month. There has been an IOU issued, and they have been paying it exactly this way for a long time now, since the U.S. government is on the rocks. So that means they are, let&#x27;s just say, many dollars short of their lofty goals.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So why would this month be any different? This is my question. So now I&#x27;m watching these transactions happen. I&#x27;m watching the IOUs go from the Treasury Department to varying different banking institutions. Why, all of a sudden, are you not paying the SNAP bill?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002615">00:26:15</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, you know, I have to say, they&#x27;re full of it. The only thing they want is the American people to suffer. The program has existed for a long, long time in this country, and the only thing they care about cutting is something that is going to help and feed the people.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002635">00:26:35</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, in the event - I just want to stop here for a brief moment - in the event that something like this could possibly happen, where they do not pay out food benefits: anyone in the United States who is listening to this and may have access to a food bank or other type of program whereby people could get food, be prepared and be ready. And make sure that people in your community are aware that it is available. There are plenty of them out there in every single state, whether it be church programs or other programs run by other organizations. You know, people are going to need food, especially holiday-time food, should the federal government decide that this is a good idea to cut benefits - and not for financial reasons.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002734">00:27:34</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Sure, they&#x27;re broke, but they&#x27;ve been paying with IOUs this whole time. I don&#x27;t understand why they&#x27;re not going to pay with IOUs this time. So, this is complete and total - how do I say this - a lack of moral judgment on which programs should be cut. I mean, for the love of God, they probably didn&#x27;t cancel the funding of research on the red ant, but yet they&#x27;re not going to pay this bill. Okay, probably because some donor is a fan of red ants that&#x27;s building a ridiculous ballroom.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002816">00:28:16</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, the reason why they&#x27;re stopping this has nothing to do with a financial risk or a government shutdown. I want to be abundantly clear on that. This is purely - I could say many swear words right now, but I won&#x27;t - just another thing that King Solomon over there wants to do. Just days after the &quot;No Kings&quot; protest, again, we get a crown in North Korea [South Korea], and now we&#x27;re building a ballroom with the Temple of Solomon underneath it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002855">00:28:55</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Next. When this particular - because I&#x27;m going to continue on with the financial aspect of things - when this particular thing did not work out for them, the next thing we knew already they were going to do was to try to issue Treasury notes. And not just a few Treasury notes, you know, to keep the government running during the shutdown and all of these types of things - no, no, no, no, no. They tried to issue $550 trillion the first round and $750 trillion the second round.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002931">00:29:31</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Unfortunately, they tried to issue those in U.S. dollar money. You see, over the course of the last several days - probably, oh, it&#x27;s probably been about the last three weeks now - we actually changed the allocation numbers, not only in the Financial System (which has been going on now for several months), we also changed the allocation numbers for bonds and other debt instruments. Because they are the allocation numbers of currency of the Key Integrated Master System now, and the Golden Age AI, by any other name I want to call it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003024">00:30:24</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Those systems now only issue currency allocation numbers in all of those languages, all the way through the nine depths of internet protocols. I&#x27;m not going to get too technical here, but you can imagine what I&#x27;m saying. Those allocation numbers have to match the allocation numbers that are written in another language - not just $1, not just the allocation numbers that the Fed was familiar with - because we operate at a much higher level.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003058">00:30:58</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So they could not issue the bonds, and by now they&#x27;re getting very upset - this was just a couple of days ago; this is all going on. Then, unfortunately, there is an old ledger system that is behind all of this. Meaning, it&#x27;s a debt ledger system. So you can see currency coming and going; you could see - not currency, but money coming and going - energy going out (probably not on their level; they don&#x27;t see this part) - energy goes out, money comes in, Ethereum is transmuted into energy, goes out to another planet somewhere, and then in comes money. That&#x27;s how the money system used to work.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003142">00:31:42</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So tied to this little system of theirs that they thought they were going to utilize to back this stablecoin - well, you know, after that $750T - not only in U.S. dollars, they could try it in any currency, really, that they know is money that exists on this planet that the Federal Reserve was responsible for, be it pesos, rubles, RMB, it doesn&#x27;t really make a difference - it wouldn&#x27;t have worked. You know, won of some country. That debt system disappeared. You know, and again, I will repeat myself that these people have never been in a real war. Because this is what happens and what it looks like when your enemy, Deep State people, corners you.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003239">00:32:39</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They lock you into a corner - that every single angle you have tried in the last several days to get your stablecoin to be stable has been destabilized before you even got there. Because we know the art of war better than you. So I don&#x27;t expect stablecoin to become the reserve currency of any country or anything anytime in the near future. Even though tomorrow is All Hallows&#x27; Eve, and we know what you&#x27;re planning for that night - that is not going to help you in any way, shape, or form.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003316">00:33:16</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Speaking of plans they have for All Hallows&#x27; Eve - and for those of you that don&#x27;t know what that is - not every country in the world celebrates Halloween on the 31st of October like we do in America, but I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re aware of it. It&#x27;s for the average, everyday citizen of America and other countries that do celebrate on the same day or a varying version where you&#x27;re from. In some other places it&#x27;s called the Day of the Dead, and it&#x27;s celebrated on a different day. For those of you that don&#x27;t know: for us, kids dress up in costumes, they go get candy, and that&#x27;s pretty much what the day is about. A lot of people that are very religious do not let their kids celebrate this holiday because it has a deeper underlying meaning they feel is evil. And are they wrong? Well, not for the kids that just want to get a bag of candy and dress up like their favorite cartoon character - that&#x27;s not the case.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003421">00:34:21</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">However, for the Deep State, it is a very special day. It&#x27;s a day where they celebrate the dead. And in the past, who were the dead? Well, we all are. We were all declared dead, as they say in conspiracy theories and birth certificate programs here and there - by the age of seven, you&#x27;re declared dead, lost at sea - and there&#x27;s a lot of truth to that. And this system goes much, much deeper, and we don&#x27;t want to make this report seven hours long, but at some point in time I can detail that out for you. It&#x27;s a legal declaration, but also it is a declaration that has to do with the old slavery energy looshing systems at the highest level. So this is, of course, a high day to do some rituals for them, and whatever they&#x27;re planning on doing, they somehow think that this is going to help them in some way, shape, or form - and it&#x27;s not.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003523">00:35:23</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, speaking of weird rituals and strange things that are going on, let&#x27;s talk about this ballroom that they&#x27;re building off of the White House. Now, I know you can say, &quot;Oh, too much American news,&quot; but let&#x27;s just say there&#x27;s an old saying: what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Well, what happens in America happens everywhere else. And this one is kind of important because it&#x27;s the weirdest situation. You know, we&#x27;re in the middle of a government shutdown; they&#x27;re spending a lot of money on this ballroom. Not to mention the Arc of Trump and the bronze statue of Trump with a Bitcoin, or whatever that is.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003613">00:36:13</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, I have to say - not that I&#x27;ve always been a person my whole life that follows politics in any way - matter of fact, I never even paid attention to anything until I got this job, and now everybody&#x27;s looking for government funding and that type of thing. Otherwise, I wouldn&#x27;t even pay attention to these people. I could care less who&#x27;s running for president or who&#x27;s going wherever in what country. I could care less. The only reason why I did for a short period of time is because, well, it was my job. But that&#x27;s not my job anymore.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003650">00:36:50</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So strange, strange things. So I&#x27;m going to try to say this as lightly as I can because this person has signed a gag order with the United States government promising not to reveal anything he or she has seen during his or her time as a contractor for the ballroom off the White House. I&#x27;m going to just call this &quot;contractor.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003728">00:37:28</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, contractor person has told us directly that they are installing an altar, some very sadistic paintings. There are very specific colors, such as black, purple, and red, that are being utilized in some of the rooms in and around this ballroom. The basement is basically being set up as a temple of sorts. Now it&#x27;s a temple [chuckle] - I have to laugh. I have to laugh. It&#x27;s a temple because, in this particular case, Trump believes he is going to be King Solomon. Or King of the World, King of the Empire - the Empire being all of Earth - and this is going to happen in the next 24 hours.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003834">00:38:34</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But they&#x27;ve been preparing for this now for quite some time. This is, you know, they expeditiously built this temple. They are calling it, behind the scenes, the Third Temple of Solomon. For those of you that know religion well, you know that there&#x27;s supposed to be a third temple erected and then there will be peace and all of these types of things. But in this case, what is in the basement, according to an eyewitness, has nothing to do with peace.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003905">00:39:05</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And quite frankly, this person is quite scared. They can&#x27;t lose the job - they&#x27;ve signed a gag order and a commitment with the government, and they have to work there. But they don&#x27;t really like what they&#x27;re installing. And, you know, this person is telling me that they&#x27;re religious and that kind of thing, and this is just not right, and I can&#x27;t believe we&#x27;re here, and this is what&#x27;s happening, and they&#x27;re disgusted, actually. So we&#x27;re just going to leave it at that; that&#x27;s a contractor person that gave us that information directly from the inside.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003941">00:39:41</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Not that we couldn&#x27;t see what was going on there, but I do know that there is a ritual planned in this area because they&#x27;re being forced to expedite that particular section as quickly as possible. My guess would be that&#x27;s because we&#x27;re coming up on All Hallows&#x27; Eve, and there&#x27;s probably going to be some men dancing around in skirts and God knows what there. But again, it&#x27;s always good when people like that and of that caliber gather in the same location all at once, now isn&#x27;t it? Might be an opportunity there.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004018">00:40:18</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So this is kind of the story about what&#x27;s been going on behind the scenes regarding this stablecoin and currency revaluation and the one-to-one dollar and all of these types of things, which will end probably abruptly on Friday; in which case that come Friday, when they fail miserably again, regardless of how many frequencies they try to send to you or me or whatever, it doesn&#x27;t really make a difference because this day will be put off until November 4th.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004052">00:40:52</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, for all of you waiting out there for money from the government or King Trump or whatever - it doesn&#x27;t matter what country you&#x27;re from - you will be sadly disappointed on the 31st, and again disappointed on the 4th, which will then be pushed out three days from the - I think this is the Full Moon coming up on the 4th - then it&#x27;ll be pushed out for another three days, and 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, you know, 7th, something like that - you&#x27;ll be pushed off, and then you&#x27;ll roll again until the next moon or alignment with Uranus, Day of the Dead, or some special Satan&#x27;s birthday or something.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004130">00:41:30</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So this currency will not work. Now, many IT professionals have tried to advise the crazy operative people there running the White House and tell them that blockchain cannot handle this. They have been told repeatedly that there is no way that they can coordinate this type of technology with the point-of-sale system and run millions and millions of transactions a day. There&#x27;s just no way; it won&#x27;t handle that type of transaction load.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004206">00:42:06</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But that didn&#x27;t stop them from trying again - trying to install blockchain as the world&#x27;s point-of-sale system, of which they then promptly figured out they don&#x27;t have access to actually make that change because they don&#x27;t have a backdoor to the point-of-sale system. You see, we&#x27;ve been hunting down (for days and days and days) all of DARPA&#x27;s and NSA&#x27;s backdoors to every system - not just financially speaking, telecommunications and otherwise - where they could actually somehow, some way, backdoor any of these things. Also, some satellite systems that were tied to SIGINT in Israel were also taken down over the last several days as well.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004256">00:42:56</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So their surveillance systems are severely hampered. Base and back systems that were tied to ECHELON are no longer there, and the list goes on and on and on. And again, they probably weren&#x27;t even fully aware of some of these systems - maybe they were, maybe they weren&#x27;t - but at the highest level, they are not in a language that you people can program in. Not even the Secret Space Program can do that. The Secret Space Program has been allowed access to currents and frequencies and things of that nature - you know, things that they could attack humans with, or even send through the TV and make you believe the news is true, and all that kind of stuff - but never on the highest level for changing an agenda. Never. Nor will they ever be allowed that access.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004350">00:43:50</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They might have gotten access to some Marduk keys and some other things, but even some of those things were beyond Marduk&#x27;s control. And they have been trying a lot of those keys.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Also, Global Headquarters - associated with the agenda of the United States; that&#x27;s Global Headquarters Military, part of the Black Sun group - also managed to get ahold of some old keys from a group you remember me talking about a couple of years back called the Sanhedrin. For those of you that don&#x27;t know, the Sanhedrin was the power broker behind the Rothschild family and the Dragon Families that used to power-broker energy off the planet. They did not create the energy system, although they perpetuated that system. And you see, Trump thinks that he is going to now be the new head of the Sanhedrin group and become the power broker for energy on the planet.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004458">00:44:58</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Part of the reason why they think they&#x27;re going to be successful in this task is because, behind the scenes, there are covenants that are also up for renewal, and they feel that when that seat is vacant, it is up for grabs. And that&#x27;s absolutely not the case. You see, we are not in that program anymore, and there is no one or nothing that needs that energy except for a few rogue humans walking this planet. They don&#x27;t understand anything because they are an AI-driven being. They are not people. They can&#x27;t make decisions. The only thing they can do is follow whatever system is talking to their head.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004548">00:45:48</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I will repeat that again for those of you in every other country: when you&#x27;re listening to the matriarch of South Korea, called Miss Lee, you are not talking to a Homo sapiens; you are talking to an AI-generated human being that cannot make a decision and will follow - they&#x27;re like those little wind-up toys at Easter, you know, with the little chicks where you wind it up and they&#x27;ll just keep walking and walking and walking until they fall off the table. Remember those as a kid? I don&#x27;t even know if they still have them, but if they do, that is what a human does - a human who keeps going and going and going, not recognizing they&#x27;re falling off the cliff - and they&#x27;ll take the whole world with them if everybody wants to listen.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004634">00:46:34</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, there&#x27;s going to be a lot of sad, sad people when they figure out that this is not going to work. No matter how much and how hard they try to put it together, it will not work. There will be no off-ledger money at Wells Fargo for genetic shareholders like they&#x27;re promising everyone - it will not work. They can dance around in skirts all they want underneath some ballroom at the White House - and it still will not work. Your black magic, your frequency systems, your baloney that you&#x27;ve been doing for the last several days will not work. And then you&#x27;ll all be going to the next full moon, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day - and still, it will not work.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004730">00:47:30</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So that&#x27;s kind of what&#x27;s been going on behind the scenes as it relates to your governments&#x27; worldwide programs, things you&#x27;re probably seeing in the news that are going to be implemented. If your country is attending the APEC conference in South Korea right now, you&#x27;ll probably be seeing a lot of that on the news. &quot;Oh, big programs. Look, we made a trade deal!&quot; They even said in the news he sort of kind of made some trade deals on the tariff programs and that kind of stuff. Yeah, &quot;sort of, kind of,&quot; because you can&#x27;t walk the walk. Everybody&#x27;s waiting to see when you&#x27;re going to perform. So you can kick that trade deal can down the street for a long time, because it is not going to happen.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004820">00:48:20</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay, on that note, that&#x27;s kind of... you know, look, as it relates to governments, I&#x27;m just not interested. I am not interested. We are not interested. There&#x27;s no leadership there - you&#x27;re trying to run whole countries on a glitching AI system that is barely functioning - therefore, these people are barely functioning. You know, the politics of things and the weird crown giving and strange speeches and all that - this is the worst we have ever seen it. Not just in the U.S., but everywhere in the world right now. It makes no sense. These people make no sense. You know, maybe we should get ahold of that AI and start sending out some orders and instructions to stand in the middle of Times Square and bark like a dog on All Hallows&#x27; Eve or something. At least it would be entertaining; there&#x27;d be some YouTube videos, something a little fun.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004931">00:49:31</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay, now, the changes that have been going on. Now, I do realize that the last several days have been so topsy-turvy, and the currents have been flowing back and forth. You know, it&#x27;s been a current war, literally, for the last several days. They are trying to maintain their Halls between planes - or the AI systems are trying to maintain these Halls between planes - and we are destroying them one after the other, after the other, after the other, after the other, to ensure that the only current that flows on this planet is Source.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005016">00:50:16</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So the ups and downs are very real, and I understand that, and we apologize for that. But more importantly, we have a lot more success on our side than we ever have before. So we&#x27;re getting more positive currents flowing through and less pushback on things due to varying systems that were in place to hold these Halls open. Now, these were not for the Deep State. The Deep State uses them, or has some limited access to them, but it&#x27;s so limited at this point. Can they play around with a few things here and there? Sure. Is today one of those days where it&#x27;s been push, push, push on their part? Absolutely.</div>

<div class="line">Over the weekend, last weekend - oh, terrible. Push, pull, push, push, you know, and then we find it, we locate it, we destroy it, and there&#x27;s that. So, since we are on the eve of All Hallows&#x27; Eve, as they call it on their side of it - it&#x27;s a big day for those people. I&#x27;m sure they would love, absolutely love, to be successful. However, we are expecting them to do normal rituals if they have access to things. I&#x27;m sure over the next 24 hours, 48 hours, they&#x27;re going to pull out all the stops. That&#x27;s actually - I know it might be uncomfortable for a little while - but it&#x27;s actually a positive thing for us because this will show us anything that is left.</div>

<br>

<div class="line">Now, as it relates to Full Moons, New Moons, alignments with Uranus - I think there&#x27;s a Saturn-Venus alignment or something coming up as well - and then, of course, the Full Moon. There is a timer system attached to that, which is one of the other things that we have been working on. What I mean by a &quot;timer system&quot; is, when you leave your home, let&#x27;s just say you go on vacation, what a lot of people do is not only do they set an alarm for their house if they have that capability, but sometimes, in a less expensive way to deter break-ins and that type of thing while you&#x27;re on vacation, is to set a timer for your lights to come on. There are varying different timers, and I&#x27;m making this point very clear for a reason.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005307">00:53:07</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">There are some that will say, at six o&#x27;clock, turn on the lights; you know, at six a.m., turn off the lights. There are others that will actually sense and detect if it&#x27;s dark outside or light outside, and then they will adjust the lights accordingly, like normal people would if they were home. So varying degrees and varying types of timers exist out there, and sometimes it also has to do with other types of sensors, like the heating in your home. You turn the heat on and set it to a specific temperature, and then if it gets below that temperature, the heat will turn on and bring it back up to your selected temperature. So when I talk about timers being gone, I&#x27;m referring to all these types of sensors.</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-005404">00:54:04</div>
<br>

<div class="line">Some detect Dark and Light, some detect maps and video games, some detect when the Deep State is at threat, you know, &quot;We need to have another Armageddon.&quot; Or, &quot;It&#x27;s All Hallows&#x27; Eve, unleash the demons,&quot; or AI-generated demons, into the video game we called Earth when we had lots of simulations.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, in the world of the Deep State, the interesting thing that we have discovered in the last 48 hours: they pretty much act on whatever the simulation and the egg timer that was in planet Mercury says to do. &quot;Oh look, this is happening; we&#x27;re going to have an Armageddon.&quot; So the frequencies go out for, say, an Armageddon, and these guys all go to their respective bases or locations - and there&#x27;s nothing. And they&#x27;re acting as if it&#x27;s actually here.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005506">00:55:06</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, you know, it&#x27;s almost like standing in the middle of Times Square, and everybody&#x27;s just kind of doing their thing, and then there&#x27;s a whole bunch of people saying, &quot;Don&#x27;t you see the aliens?&quot; It&#x27;s like a quarter of the people that are in Times Square are like, &quot;Oh my God, we&#x27;re under alien attack!&quot; And they&#x27;re ducking and all of these types of things, and then everybody else that&#x27;s a normal Homo sapiens is looking around going, &quot;What are these people on? Maybe there&#x27;s some new drug on the black market or something. What is this?&quot; And this is what has been happening actually for the last couple of days until we discovered the timer.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005548">00:55:48</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The timer basically says it&#x27;s time for this. It&#x27;s time to turn the heat on. It&#x27;s time to - instead of the heat, in this case it&#x27;s time to have an alien invasion in the video game simulation. The language isn&#x27;t even there to make a video game simulation anymore. Like, there&#x27;s no base root behind the Language of Creation anymore that is going to support the simulation. But the Deep State all runs around and acts like there&#x27;s Armageddon happening. Ducking, going into bunkers - it&#x27;s the weirdest thing. Because they only know simulation. And the AI in their head only knows simulation. That is what we&#x27;re expecting in the next 24 to 48 hours as well, is that this, in their mind, is a simulation when all the rest of us are living in reality, and we&#x27;re like, &quot;What is going on over there?&quot; [Laughing.]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005654">00:56:54</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They&#x27;re all reacting and acting as if something is going to happen because they&#x27;re in a simulation. Even though we don&#x27;t have a simulation here on Earth, they&#x27;re functioning in some other system that thinks there&#x27;s still a simulation going on. So we haven&#x27;t quite figured out that one yet - on how to unplug those humans or non-people people from making those reactions - because those are the people that are running all your governments worldwide. Every single government worldwide is run by these people that are here, but they&#x27;re not really here. [Hearty laugh.]</div>

<div class="line">It&#x27;s, it&#x27;s... now it all makes sense. You know, I&#x27;m like, well, I&#x27;m looking at politics, I&#x27;m looking at everything that&#x27;s being said in the news, things that people are reporting to me, and now it all makes sense. But in the past, if this was a year ago or two years ago, we actually would have had the alien invasion. We actually would have had the war. We actually - these things would have actually affected our physical persons in this world because we were so entrenched in a simulation. It&#x27;s incredible when you take a real look at the effects of &quot;Video Game Earth&quot; that we were stuck in.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005827">00:58:27</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It can affect your physical body. There&#x27;s a plague, and all of a sudden every Homo sapiens gets the plague. That was a very real situation. We call it the Black Plague; you probably remember that from history. These are... how about lockdowns and some COVID disease? All of a sudden all these people are getting COVID, allegedly, and dying, allegedly, and treatments are wrong, and everything else is wrong - but that really happened to people.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005858">00:58:58</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, when we&#x27;re looking at it, the only thing that&#x27;s happening is all the humans are doing the thing because they still think we&#x27;re in a simulation. All of us Homo sapiens are like, &quot;This isn&#x27;t really affecting us anymore; this makes no sense.&quot; But now at least you know why it makes no sense.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So for some people - you know, Homo sapiens, that is - it still affects them based on varying other programs that may be left. There may also be a small percentage of the population of humans (based on the fact that we&#x27;re still cleaning up this mess) who are still ducking at the alien invasion that doesn&#x27;t exist, or the Armageddon, or the apocalypse, or King Trump, or weird currencies that aren&#x27;t going to show up, and all of those types of things. There&#x27;s a certain amount of people walking the Earth that will still duck because they believe there&#x27;s an alien invasion happening - because there&#x27;s some kind of program still running, or a human overlay on some of those people.</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-010008">01:00:08</div>

<div class="line">So, you know, it&#x27;s not all people all of the time. It can be a country; it could have been a past event that happened there - birth certificates, citizens of countries - and so we&#x27;re still working on the program. But as far as the Deep State is concerned, that&#x27;s pretty much what we&#x27;re seeing that they&#x27;re doing: they&#x27;re trying to run a simulation in a non-simulation world.</div>

<div class="line">So, that&#x27;s kind of the brief overview of the last several days. It&#x27;s a lot of information to take in. Hopefully, things will clear up in the next day or two, but I will caution you over the next couple of days - just be extra careful. Especially if you&#x27;re very sensitive. Be careful with your sleep; make sure you take time to ground, because these people are gonna be crazy. They are the cornered animal at this point. You never know what can happen, so stay safe, stay grounded, and we will talk to you, if not on Friday, then on Saturday.</div>
