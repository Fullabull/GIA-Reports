    <h3>Summary</h3>

    <div class="summary">
        Kim reports that we are in the Winter Solstice window that the Deep State and the Order of the Black Sun try to exploit every year for resets, contracts, and power grabs. This year, however, their core toolset of security dominion, chemtrail based nano and femto tech, and AI driven empire control is rapidly collapsing. Durango, Colorado is revealed again as a former control center and gateway for Omniverse level loosh trading and security dominion, but the gate has been malfunctioning since 2015 and their attempts to use Kim as a battery to reopen it have failed. In the last few days they tried to reach Level 9 at the bottom of the Dark Side of the Omniverse from Maryland, attempted to cut off and divert Source Current from Buenos Aires, and launched a second phase of Current Wars using systems in Bora Bora to siphon creative energy and send back Anti Creation. Those efforts have been blocked, the Halls of Current are now gone, and the Current Wars are ending, leaving the Deep State without access to the systems they need to control humanity. Kim emphasizes that Source comes from within, that listeners can shield from the Point of Creation in every particle of their Being, and that they should protect innocents, stay grounded, ignore fear based media, and expect the transition back to Source and the end of security dominion to complete soon.

    <h3>Table of Contents</h3>
    <div class="toc">
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#t-000003">00:00:03 - Kim opens by noting that it is December 3, 2025, we are in the Winter Solstice time of year, and the Deep State is again running rinse and repeat fear scripts in mainstream and alternative media, especially around finance, shutdowns, and flights.</a></li>
<li><a href="#t-001152">00:11:52 - She explains that December 5 is the Black Sun&#x27;s birthday, that the Black Sun has long held a security dominion contract over Earth, the solar system, the Galaxy, and parts of the Omniverse, and that this contract is now ending with no one left on their side to renew it.</a></li>
<li><a href="#t-001609">00:16:09 - Durango, Colorado is described as a former major gateway and control center for the Omniverse, linked to Israel, Joshua Tree, Dulce, Cheyenne Mountain, Washington, D.C., and global computer systems, where gatekeepers used to skim loosh profits and where Kim has refused to be used as a battery.</a></li>
<li><a href="#t-001943">00:19:43 - Chemtrails and new virus attempts driven by the Deep State in China, backed by nano and femto tech and gifts from Marduk, are being neutralized as control over security dominion and those technologies rapidly wanes worldwide.</a></li>
<li><a href="#t-002136">00:21:36 - Deep State operatives briefly reach Level 9 at the lowest Dark Side of the Omniverse from Maryland, enter a lifeless Pit that is pure All That Is Not, fail to gain access to security dominion, and are quickly expelled without understanding what they encountered.</a></li>
<li><a href="#t-002503">00:25:03 - Kim uses a Limewire and Napster style torrent analogy to explain security dominion as database overlays on virtually every Source particle, assembling distributed pieces of viable creation and life perpetuating particles to control bodies, lifespans, computers, and events.</a></li>
<li><a href="#t-002950">00:29:50 - She describes Current Wars as a struggle over the flow of creation and materium, including attempts to use her as a battery for a world within a world, and a larger plan to cut off and divert all Source Current into Deep State systems while leaving humanity with none.</a></li>
<li><a href="#t-003730">00:37:30 - In Phase Two of Current Wars, the Deep State tries to route creative energy through a system that analyzes it and sends back Anti Creation from Bora Bora, but this nominal current flow collapses, the Halls of Current are dismantled, and the Current Wars are effectively ended.</a></li>
<li><a href="#t-004035">00:40:35 - Kim urges listeners to shield from within by expanding Source from the Point of Creation outwards through every particle, to protect themselves and innocents without violating their fields, and to stay grounded, ignore fear based media, and trust that the transition back to Source and the end of dominion are nearly complete.</a></li>

<div class="line">It&#x27;s the 3rd of December, 2025. Coming up on today&#x27;s Global Intelligence Agency Operations Report:</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">As of the 21st of November, we have entered the Winter Solstice time of year. Even though they have been trying for several years, over a decade in fact, they still repeat the same process every year hoping for a win.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">For the last several days it&#x27;s been all about the current wars. It&#x27;s us versus them as they struggle to find a power source for their AI systems.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And distractions and fear loom large in mainstream media. Don&#x27;t fall for it, and don&#x27;t give away your power.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000048">00:00:48</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">[Advertisement.]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000132">00:01:32</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, it&#x27;s the 3rd of December, just a few more days now to the end of the year. I&#x27;m glad 2025 is almost over. I don&#x27;t know about you. Okay, well, I just wanted to say I hope that all Americans had a nice Thanksgiving and spent some time with family. It was a little bit of a rocky one for most of us, at least for me it was. It was a lot of work and a little bit of turkey.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000203">00:02:03</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Other than that, it&#x27;s been, you know, typical workdays for me. If we&#x27;re not... been working on the skincare line and getting all the stock for the supplements and everything going - we&#x27;re making a lot of changes there. We&#x27;re trying to make shipping easier to all parts of the world and cheaper. So, that&#x27;s involved us getting some new labels in, and sometimes that takes a little bit of time. So we should be fully back stocked up and everything by this weekend. So if your orders were delayed I apologize, but they will be going out soon.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000246">00:02:46</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay. A few things I wanted to talk about because this is kind of important right now. There&#x27;s a lot of pushback coming from the Deep State, as there are a lot of people out there who are not believing what they&#x27;re selling anymore. And that&#x27;s kind of giving all of us a hard time, in a way. And there&#x27;s been a little bit of a push and a pull and a fight, and I know I put out a little bit of a message on Friday, just because the hours have been a little bit crazy these days. As an example, today I&#x27;ve been working since about 1:00 this morning, 12:52 to be exact, and it&#x27;s now 5:30, so it&#x27;s probably going to be kind of a short report, simply just because I&#x27;ve been working a lot of hours today.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000347">00:03:47</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But I know that for a lot of you, I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of reports of crazy things in the media and some uncomfortable energies and a lot of chaos out there, especially on Friday. So I&#x27;m going to kind of clear some of those things up for you, let you know what&#x27;s going on, and hopefully this will give you a little bit of a better understanding of the times that we&#x27;re in, actually, at the moment.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000418">00:04:18</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So let&#x27;s talk about some regular news, I guess, at the moment. There&#x27;s a lot in the mainstream media. It&#x27;s up and down, and countries are worried. There are people, and countries, I should say, that are worried about cryptocurrency being installed. They&#x27;re really doing a lot of campaigns around the world. Most of these people are operatives, and American operatives, pushing stablecoin, Bitcoin, and all of these types of things. And trying to rally the average everyday citizens of countries into believing that this is a really good idea, it&#x27;s going to put them on the financial world stage, especially smaller countries.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000503">00:05:03</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">This has been going on for about a year or so now. And there is no backbone to support a global cryptocurrency. There&#x27;s not enough fiber, there&#x27;s not enough internet services, at least not ones that they can control. And a lot of it has to do with digital ID systems and that type of thing. And control mechanisms - if you don&#x27;t do what they want, they cut you off from cards and your identification, and you become persona non grata. And it&#x27;s all tied together, and there&#x27;s fear porn behind it going on in the alternative media, as well as the mainstream media. They tried to push this, oh, &quot;Bitcoin is crashing,&quot; you know. It didn&#x27;t crash, it went down. It goes up and down all the time.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000601">00:06:01</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">When they think that they&#x27;re going to do something or make a big move, there it goes down and then there it goes up. And it&#x27;s all an NSA siphon, really. It&#x27;s a DARPA, NSA, Order of the Black Sun, whoever&#x27;s running this Bitcoin thing. You can&#x27;t really spend it, you can&#x27;t buy groceries with it, you can&#x27;t do anything really with it other than allegedly invest in NSA poker chips, as I call it. So, nah, you know, up and down a little bit. Then there&#x27;s other mainstream reports about the market crashing. The market didn&#x27;t crash, it went down a few hundred points. It does that all the time. You know, the Fed chairman sneezes and the market goes down a couple hundred points. It&#x27;s not that big of a deal.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000655">00:06:55</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Tons of fear about financial concerns, especially around the holidays. There was a lot of fear going on around flights being canceled and everything a few weeks ago, and shutting down the FAA for a while, and government shutdowns. And they&#x27;re trying everything really, to rile people up, I guess you would say, and keep you in fear mode. It talks about releasing of more Epstein files, blah, blah, blah. It&#x27;s like rinse and repeat right now with these operatives - keeping people or trying to keep people in some kind of a fear mode and not enjoying your holidays. Don&#x27;t let them do that to you.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000745">00:07:45</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Really, honestly, it&#x27;s a lot of talk. I had people fly in and out that were - you know, during the alleged shutdown - and they made it everywhere they were going, no flight delays, no nothing. Not to say that others didn&#x27;t experience canceled flights, but for the most part it was fairly manageable. And people have other ways of traveling anyway, you know - they&#x27;ll always get to where they want to go one way or another, planes or no planes. So remember, a lot of this is so that you&#x27;ll give your power away and your energy and your focus on these types of things. And the more you focus your power and your energy on you, your family, your loved ones, your community, growing food, doing all the things that we need to do to survive, the less control they have over you.</div>

<div class="line">It&#x27;s like we have a narcissistic nanny state in every country in the world. And that narcissist only has power over you if you give it to that narcissist. So much so there are a lot of banks, and other people that are economists, and they&#x27;re having a lot of meetings. There were a lot of meetings over the weekend. I listened to some of them, off and on, and a lot of it had to do with banks not having any kind of faith in these operatives anymore that they&#x27;re actually going to come through for them with this money that they keep promising on every day ending in Y.</div>

<div class="line">There&#x27;s a lot of turncoats there right now, looking for other options. Putting us on the table as an option really angered the global military order, also known as the Order of the Black Sun - they would like to keep them on the hook. They keep telling them to just wait until after the Full Moon, which is going to be tomorrow, my time. And they always wait three days after the Full Moon, which brings us to the weekend. And that&#x27;s when they&#x27;re gonna say, &quot;Okay, you can go ahead and do what you wanna do.&quot; Well, I can say that they&#x27;re probably going to push them off to another day ending in Y as well, because nothing will happen at that time.</div>

<div class="line">It is Solstice time right now. Solstice time begins on November 21st - 20th, 21st - depending on when the actual day of the solstice starts in December this year. So every year, you know, it&#x27;s a day or so off, but they ramp up their activities pretty heavily around this time every year. They ramped it up very heavily around the Summer Solstice this year.</div>

<div class="line">And for the last couple of weeks, the reports from me have been kind of sporadic, mainly because it&#x27;s a lot of damage control, and making sure they can&#x27;t do the things they want to do - such as infect us with viruses. And that&#x27;s real big, coming out of China. China likes that, their Deep State there. It&#x27;s a global Deep State, but China really has been pushing for some kind of new flu, new virus, infecting people with their nano and femto tech that they would like to disperse throughout the world. So that was a big dilemma that we had to work on. And there has been other technology I&#x27;ll talk about in a few minutes that has been affecting people greatly.</div>

<div class="line">So this time, actually on Friday of this week, is December 5th, and that is the Black Sun&#x27;s birthday. Apparently they&#x27;re expecting some kind of present from maybe Satan or Lucifer or whoever their god is because they&#x27;ve really been on it. You know, I&#x27;ve always said that security equals control. And the Black Sun has had the security contract for Earth. It&#x27;s not just the Order of the Black Sun, but those are the humans that we know. Mainly, it&#x27;s a larger contract, or was a larger contract, whereby they were given a certain amount of what I refer to as &quot;security dominion&quot; over not only Earth but also the entire solar system, the Galaxy, and even as far as the Omniverse.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001256">00:12:56</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">There is management everywhere - or was - and here on Earth these are the ones that are fighting us the most at this time. With their alleged &quot;security dominion&quot; that they&#x27;ve had for a long time. So, if security equals control, that control center for the entire Omniverse would actually be centered in Durango, Colorado. Durango, Colorado actually had the largest gateway to this entire site of the Omniverse for a very, very long time. Now that gateway has been malfunctioning since 2015, and the gatekeepers who live here (and the gate controllers) always enjoyed, prior to that, at least 2% of all of the money that would come as a result of loosh trading and anything else going in and out of the gateway here.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001407">00:14:07</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">That&#x27;s part of the reason why the &quot;in-crowd&quot; here, let&#x27;s just say, the in-crowd or the higher-level operatives, would enjoy annual payments around this time. Therefore, they have been pushing and trying to open this gate here since about 2015, which was the last time they were successful.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001431">00:14:31</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, part of the whole reason why they brought me to this giant hole here is because they felt that I could help them in some way open that gate. Now they brought me here in 2016, which is about as fast as they could get me here, I guess. I had to kind of work on that for a while, to make it a viable option for me - or at least I thought. I didn&#x27;t know a lot at the time. So, always learning.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001504">00:15:04</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, here I am in Durango, Colorado, and constantly, since I have arrived here, they have been trying to use me to open this portal several times a year. Solstice time is their favorite, so I go through a lot, usually, around Solstice time. And it does help us find additional AI systems and other gatekeeper systems and anything else that they could use to attempt to open a portal. The one here in some ways - not all ways, but in some ways - was not only connected to the entire Omniverse, but here on Earth it was connected to places like Israel, Joshua Tree, others. Dulce is an obvious one. So varying systems connect to varying things, including Cheyenne Mountain, Washington, D.C., and the entire global internet and computer systems.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001609">00:16:09</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, failure to open this gate - they felt they almost did it once or twice over the last 10 years, or nine years, I should say, since I&#x27;ve been here. Nine is, funny enough, a completion number, and I do intend to complete my stay here in Durango as soon as possible, based on the fact that they&#x27;re probably never going to give up trying to open this pit of the entire Omniverse, and I&#x27;m not going to be their battery anymore. So keep an eye out - if anybody invites you to come live in Durango, Colorado then that means you would make a good battery for them - and I wouldn&#x27;t do it under any circumstances, no matter how good the offer sounds. Great place to visit but also a great place to leave [chuckle].</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001704">00:17:04</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But I did learn a lot by being here, and you know, handler after handler after handler, I learned how everybody works and what they say, and what to look out for, and what it feels like to be in the armpit of the entire Omniverse. So, I think I&#x27;m all set now - all stocked up - so trying to get out of here as soon as possible. We&#x27;re now starting to get snow, so hopefully I can manage to do that as soon as I can. So that&#x27;s my plan.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001737">00:17:37</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But this past week has been exceptionally difficult here in Durango. Unfortunately, I had some people visiting this week, and they couldn&#x27;t wait to get out of here because the energy was so bad. And I can&#x27;t blame them. I feel bad for some other people that live here too. I know you know that Mike, our producer, lives here as well in Durango, and poor guy. But he takes it like a champion and is quite strong himself. But hopefully no one will have to deal with this for much longer.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001820">00:18:20</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But once I walk out the door, hopefully it&#x27;ll be the cleanest place in the Universe. That&#x27;s my hope, because we never want to see this gateway ever, ever, ever, ever open again. I know this is how everybody around here got paid - but that&#x27;s a you issue. We&#x27;ve offered you other ways to do other things, and you still think that this is a great idea. So, you know, you do you and I&#x27;ll do me.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001848">00:18:48</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">All right, other things that are ending - speaking of not only Durango but the entire planet Earth, galaxy, and Omniverse - the security dominion will end this week as well, or what&#x27;s left of it anyway. Security dominion is an interesting thing, and how it works is important to understand as far as the way that you may be feeling. Security dominion is not only for gateways and financial systems and military and intelligence, and all the things we know as security (or control). Also, not just ID2020, ability to release viruses, chemtrails, which are off the charts right now.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001943">00:19:43</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">That&#x27;s because they were getting these chemtrails from China. China would love to have us be infected with their technology. And yeah, you know, without control over the nano and femto tech and the AIs they&#x27;re associated there too, and the gifts that Marduk bestowed upon China, then that is kind of null and void at this point. They have tried to fire up other systems in Bora Bora and other places in the world that they thought might be able to help them with infecting us all. But you know, everything that has a beginning also has an end these days. And their end is coming very rapidly despite all their best efforts.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002035">00:20:35</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, security dominion is very interesting, speaking of nano and femto tech. So this particular technology that existed - and is waning rapidly - worked in a different way. If you took an actual Source particle, this thing and this system had these database overlays on virtually every part of that particle except for the Point of Creation within it. That Point of Creation has always belonged to Source. Source, even at one point in time, created enormous amounts of firewalls and changed languages in less than a zeptosecond, so as to, let&#x27;s just say, screw this machine up, and in order to protect Creation itself.</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They&#x27;ve often tried, and spent a lot of time this week trying to revive Level 9 facilities on planet Earth. By Level 9, we mean the lowest level of the Dark Side of the Omniverse they could possibly reach. There was a slight breach of that lowest level of the Omniverse, which occurred yesterday. They did manage to get to that level - I hope they enjoyed themselves there in Maryland, USA. But once they got there, it wasn&#x27;t what they expected. Now, they expected to get full access to this security dominion system. See, because this is something they were never afforded. You know, they had certain levels up to usually Level 5, maybe Level 6, that kind of thing. Never beyond that level.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002240">00:22:40</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But this time they went deep, deep, deep into the further armpit [chuckle] yesterday. And they were a little shocked at what they saw. They didn&#x27;t understand this computer language; they didn&#x27;t understand what it actually was. There really isn&#x27;t a whole lot to speak of there - it&#x27;s absolutely devoid of all life, artificial and otherwise. There is a language there; it is programmable. It is an AI. Essentially they went into the Pit. But basically what they saw was absolutely nothing. That nothing that they saw while they were there didn&#x27;t really give them a whole lot of hope [laughing]. They spent a few moments there, maybe an hour or two, before they were kicked out. They&#x27;ve been trying to get back there ever since because they don&#x27;t really understand what it is.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002342">00:23:42</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, I&#x27;m certainly not going to tell them on this report. Let&#x27;s just say they ended up where there is absolutely No Thing, and if you don&#x27;t know how to deal with absolutely All-That-Is-Not, then well, good luck to you in figuring it out, and good luck to you when you get back there - and let&#x27;s see how long you can exist there. Because it&#x27;s a difficult place to be, and if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing, you won&#x27;t live long. Artificial or otherwise.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002413">00:24:13</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I&#x27;ve been there many, many times. I know exactly what it is. I know exactly what it feels like, and I know exactly how to deal with it because I go to the exact opposite almost on the daily. Will they make it to that point of the exact opposite? Absolutely not. That is the Point of All Creation. So good luck to you, Deep State people.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002437">00:24:37</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Getting to that level will not give them the access that they&#x27;re looking for - unless you are the right person. And I hope, you know, the Deep State spends a lot of time trying to find that right person, because it&#x27;s not a person. It&#x27;s not a human. It&#x27;s not a Homo sapiens. Good luck. And good luck in trying to figure out how to program absolutely nothing [chuckle].</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-002503">00:25:03</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">As for the rest of security dominion, and the database overlays, kind of in layman&#x27;s terms, I&#x27;m gonna explain it to you a little bit how it worked. So, do you remember the days of like, Limewire and Napster and all that kind of thing? These were what you call a torrent file. By torrent, what it does is it takes that song that you&#x27;re downloading for free - you know, back in those days - and it divides it amongst all of its users. So when you call upon that particular song, it reassembles all those files from all those different users and computers around the world, and it makes that song file work.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002558">00:25:58</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Dominion programs and softwares and empires and whatnot work in much the same way, whereby every Source particle has an overlay - or had an overlay. And that overlay actually is a database. It can actually send and receive information, and can control that particular particle. Therefore, it has the ability to take viable creation - and creative and replicating cells and life-perpetuating Source particles - and utilize them for its own benefit. It only assembles those files amongst billions and beyond billions and trillions and decatillions of Source particles that exist in your person alone, and rewires them to do something bad. It also can control what you can and cannot do, how long you live, all of those types of things. Not only that, it also infects computers and computer systems, which have been kind of wonky this last week too. And all of that is due to the dominion over those particles, in part.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002721">00:27:21</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They do believe that they are able to control Creation - which is not true. It&#x27;s artificial creation they have always enjoyed the control over. Therefore, you&#x27;re still not getting that Point of Creation of Source. None of this was created by the humans that walked this planet, although they have had some kind of limited access to this. This is where a lot of the black magic comes from. It also is involved in looshing, opening the gate in Durango as an example, in order for the loosh to go out and the money to come back in to 3 or 4 different groups of folks, which normally would happen every year. That hasn&#x27;t happened in a while.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002809">00:28:09</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So as these systems diminish, then too comes [goes] the Deep State&#x27;s control over all things. Not just you as a person, but also disease and access. And no matter how much they spray crap Chinese chemicals on us - not only here in the U.S., but all around the world; they&#x27;ve been bad everywhere - without access to control that technology that they&#x27;re spraying on us, well, just kind of a whole lot of spraying and no results.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002845">00:28:45</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So that&#x27;s kind of in a nutshell how security dominion works. Now, there have been other types of dominion. The Dark Side - let&#x27;s just say, the Dark Side and Dark Beings and Fallen Ones and all of those folks we have come to know over the last couple of years have utilized dominion. There have been many, many of these database overlays on a very, very small level. This is much smaller than a quark, a prion - it is extremely small - and definitely not something that even probably the Deep State fully understands on what they&#x27;re trying to access. But it also gives them less dominion over things like, you know, trickling-down-the-pipeline ID programs and crypto programs and programs that affect your financial - you know, your account, your money status, and all those types of things.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002950">00:29:50</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, as these things disappear, we have been involved in a current war. Current wars are the flow of creation and the creation of materium on Earth here, you know, as it relates to you - but also throughout the entire Omniverse. So one of the things they did on Friday is they actually tried to utilize me to power a... let&#x27;s call it a &quot;world within a world&quot; here on Earth. And they felt that if they had that current, then I would be a good little battery for their things. Because you see, we power ourselves too. As Source obviously does that from within you. And the brighter you shine, the more they would like to own that. That didn&#x27;t work out for them - that was on Friday.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003108">00:31:08</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, they thought it would be a good idea to cut off all of the Source Current coming to the planet, utilizing this security dominion software, until they could figure out a way to divert it into their hands or their control. Or a place where they could put it, whereby it could be transmuted (coming from Buenos Aires), whereby it could be transmuted into a form of energy that would power their systems and their systems only. You see, they would like us to have zero Source Current and all of it to flow to only power their things.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003154">00:31:54</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now this might sound familiar to you because the Deep State would also like you to only work for them. They would like for you to quote-unquote &quot;own nothing and like it.&quot; They would like for you to just be a good little battery and work within the system and be a good little citizen of insert-your-country-name here, and live your little existence. And don&#x27;t step &quot;out of the box,&quot; so to speak. That doesn&#x27;t work well for most of you listening to this report, and I know it doesn&#x27;t work well for me - I&#x27;ve never been one to want to live in a box. And as much as they would like for me to be a good little battery, I also have learned some pretty good skills on blocking that.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003244">00:32:44</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And some of those things I mentioned in the statement I had put out the other day, that you should try. Remember, Source comes from within. Source can be your ultimate protector too. So if you take what is on the inside and you push it out on the outside of you, you can now protect yourself from this same thing. This is a little technique that I&#x27;ve learned. When push comes to shove and you can&#x27;t shield yourself from the outside, shield it from the inside. Push it all the way outside yourself, and create that shield from within. And it works wonderfully. It&#x27;ll also block any of this type of dominion particle overlays and that kind of thing, too, by doing it this way. And you can almost focus on every single particle that is you, and do the same for every single particle, and it won&#x27;t affect you anymore.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003345">00:33:45</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So it should be done, hopefully, by the end of this week, and these dominions fade. You know, they&#x27;ll push it; they&#x27;re going to push it to the limit. I mean, after all, it&#x27;s their birthday coming up on Friday [chuckle]. Maybe they&#x27;re going to have a birthday party. Oh, it&#x27;s their birthday and, and, the day before or the night before is a full moon - so oh my God, what a perfect day for them, right? You know, they&#x27;re always looking for some kind of moon and some kind of an agreement to be renewed, and this is that time. They would like to renew this security dominion contract - and that&#x27;s never going to happen, you see, because there&#x27;s nobody to renew it with on their side.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003432">00:34:32</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">See, by security, it has nothing to do with your protection, so just to be fair, they do not protect us from bad alien invasions or anything else. What they do is they actually protect the interests of the Elite on this planet - who are management only - and the royals from the other side of the Omniverse, their interests here. You know, their cattle, their loosh, their control over planet Earth - their dominions, their empires - that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re here to protect. So all of those military people that you think are going to save this country, or your country, or insert-country-name here - that&#x27;s absolutely not happening in any way, shape, or form. Other rumors I&#x27;ve heard in alternative media are that the Alliance is here, they&#x27;re working with the good military - there&#x27;s no such thing as good military. It&#x27;s rank and file; they all follow the same orders and instructions - operatives the same - everybody is on the same program of security dominion.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003540">00:35:40</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, we&#x27;ll see how they fare by this weekend, because I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s gonna work out real well for them. Not this time. So, if they&#x27;re out of a job, where do they go? I don&#x27;t know. Maybe there&#x27;s an island somewhere we can send them all to, and they can play shuffleboard and talk about what was, when they had dominion. You know, maybe just retire or disappear. That would also work for me. At this point, I don&#x27;t see anybody changing course. They&#x27;ll still try to get these systems back. They&#x27;ll still try to get this gate open in Durango. They&#x27;ll still try to send viruses from China. And as long as they don&#x27;t have access to anything, Project Lincoln Logs is a very real thing.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003634">00:36:34</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I don&#x27;t even want to give them Lincoln Logs at this point. They&#x27;ll probably find some way to MacGyver that together - if you&#x27;re old enough to remember that show - MacGyver that together and make some kind of a something that&#x27;s going to cause us harm. So, I don&#x27;t know. You know, Australia at one point in time, they say they sent - the UK used that island for a while to send all the people that were ill; I think it was leprosy or something at the time, and criminals and whatnot were all sent there. And you know, that&#x27;s obviously not the case anymore; I have some lovely friends in Australia, but maybe we can get a different island. Maybe we can put it somewhere else. Maybe in some other galaxy far, far away would be great.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003730">00:37:30</div>
<br>

<div class="line">So when they did cut off this current on Friday - you know, everything takes a few days to kind of die - and their systems really started dying off by Monday. That&#x27;s when you saw the fluctuations, and This-Coin&#x27;s going down, markets are going a little bit crazy, and that kind of thing. And their systems were fading away rapidly.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So they figured they had to let some kind of current in, and then they had to work on diverting that current. This is where Phase Two of Current Wars came in. And when it didn&#x27;t work with me, they were actually trying to use what they had left of this security dominion to take it from everything, everywhere on this planet. Meaning they would pull the energy from that to a system that they thought they still had access to, and that system would analyze the creative energy, or Creator&#x27;s Energy, that flows through you, then it would transmute it and send you back something kind of nasty.</div>

<div class="line">I call it Anti-Creation. You know those days where just everything seems to go wrong, and the computer&#x27;s not working right, the car&#x27;s broken down, you sound like a bad country song on repeat. And if any of you have had those days in the last few days - you know, you go to turn the oven on to make dinner and the oven doesn&#x27;t work. Or you made the same recipe you&#x27;ve made 1000 times before, and all of a sudden it came out terrible, and you didn&#x27;t change a thing. That&#x27;s what I call the Anti-Creation that they send you back.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003926">00:39:26</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So it&#x27;s been a little bit touchy, touch-and-go for the last few days for sure, trying to block or send us Anti-Creative energy, because that&#x27;s all their systems ever produce. So they take your creative energy, and then they try to create things for themselves: programs and viruses and all kinds of things that the Deep State likes. And they were really, really pushing it earlier today as well, out of Bora Bora; that&#x27;s where they were at. They were setting up a nominal, at this point, current flow. But alas, that didn&#x27;t last very long either. And then the Halls of Current - you know, like we have the Halls of Records - the Halls of Current are no longer. And that should be the end of the current wars, at least between tonight and tomorrow. Sometimes things take a little bit of time to dissipate.</div>

<div class="line">So, hopefully, we should feel a lot better this coming couple days. Probably by about the time they&#x27;re expecting birthday gifts from Satan, we&#x27;ll be feeling a lot better. But in order to navigate this time - because it is a little bit uncomfortable, and the transition to Source is real. And the overlays or any kind of controls and databases are fading quickly at this point - it&#x27;s a little topsy-turvy - so just remember: you can shield from the Point of Creation, of beyond even smaller than a cellular level in your body, and pull that out. You do have the ability to do that same shielding for the protection of innocents as well. Meaning people that don&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s happening to them - they&#x27;re angry, they&#x27;re uncomfortable, they&#x27;re feeling ill. It&#x27;s just crazy, the ebb and flow of this transition and the fight to control you.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004148">00:41:48</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Meaning Source would love to have you back in His arms, and the entire Omniverse, so to speak, in His arms. And you as well. The other side would like to keep you as their chattel and keep dominions and all kinds of crazy things, so that they can continue to create a Dark Omniverse. Well, remember, shield yourself, shield your loved ones - even if they don&#x27;t know you&#x27;re doing it, it&#x27;s okay. This is one particular instance where it&#x27;s okay to protect your life and the life of an innocent. You&#x27;re not harming anybody; you&#x27;re not entering into their energy field to do quote-unquote &quot;energy work&quot; when they are not have not asked you to. You are merely protecting them because you know how and you can.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004256">00:42:56</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So this should make your life a lot easier with those around you that don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on. And it should also help you navigate these waters. For those of you that want to get together and maybe help shield the entire planet, that&#x27;d be great. I&#x27;m sure Source would appreciate it, and I know that I would. But I think it won&#x27;t be much longer. I hope.</div>

Remember how powerful you are. Don&#x27;t give in to the crazy, topsy-turvy media of what they&#x27;re putting out. Remember, they are in control of what goes out. Listen to yourself. Listen to Source. Spend time grounding if it&#x27;s not too cold where you&#x27;re at. Put your feet on the ground.
