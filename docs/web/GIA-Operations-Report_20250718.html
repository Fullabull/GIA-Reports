    <h3>Summary</h3>

    <div class="summary">
        Kim explains that mainstream news, wars, political narratives, and global crises are scripted by Deep State systems and executed through heads of state, militaries, and global institutions that have never operated independently. She states that national governments, wars, and elections are pre-written performances designed to control perception, while Deep State actors, SSP programs, and non-human factions fight over ancient deep underground military bases that support travel, experimentation, cloning, and interdimensional access. Kim emphasizes that nearly every country contains such facilities, and that citizens, soldiers, and patriots unknowingly serve systems that despise them, feeding financial, medical, and food-based control grids. She explains that the true solution for humanity is not political resistance but rebuilding local communities, sourcing food and essentials locally, planning together, and seeing themselves as sovereign custodians of Earth. She concludes by urging viewers to focus on self-reliance, community resilience, and Creator connection while the Deep State collapses under its own failed plans.

    <h3>Transcript</h3>
    <div class="transcript">
        <br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000013">00:00:13</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Technical difficulties always, especially when I go live. So apparently you can now hear me. We&#x27;ve had to reboot modems and internet and all kinds of things several times. But we&#x27;re going to surprise the Deep State a little bit today. You know, it&#x27;s not going to be too bad for them. We&#x27;re going to give you some information based on a lot of things that we&#x27;re hearing.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000035">00:00:35</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So for the last several reports, I&#x27;ve been giving a lot of information: locations, different sites that things are happening right now. Like within 24 to 48 hours of the report, I&#x27;m telling you pretty much blow-by-blow of what&#x27;s happening in the world. It&#x27;s something that you&#x27;re not really getting from anywhere. I know that there are a lot of other people giving quote-unquote &quot;intel,&quot; and that type of thing, but I can tell you - you don&#x27;t hear it like you hear it here.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And I&#x27;m saying this because, well, you know, that also makes me a really big target. And I&#x27;ve been a pretty high target now for a long time, but the last week or two has been, let&#x27;s just say, a lot. It&#x27;s a lot to take in over here and still do my job.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000127">00:01:27</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, we&#x27;re going to talk a little bit about some mainstream stuff. And the reason why I&#x27;m doing that - just a tiny, tiny bit - the reason why I&#x27;m doing that is because there&#x27;s a lot of misinformation out there. And I can&#x27;t stress to all of you enough - and for some of you this might be a little bit repetitive - I can&#x27;t stress to all of you enough that what you see in mainstream media is for your consumption. This is not ongoing operations. This is not Deep State disclosure. If you are listening to alternative media, you might hear some surface-level stuff that they find interesting to pass on to their people who relay intel.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But it&#x27;s not real intel like you get here. I mean, we tell you pretty much where they are almost in real time, at least within 48 hours of when they&#x27;re there.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000229">00:02:29</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And we know a lot of secrets, things that people don&#x27;t tell you. And I know a lot of you might be a little bit confused about that.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And I say this because I get a lot of messages every day. I get messages from some people talking about not just the United States, but other countries, telling me how they believe they can fix said country. A lot of people would like to tell me how to do that. I get a lot of people saying, well look, you know, if you could just do some projects in here and there, everything will be great.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And, well, that&#x27;s not really the case. Not only that, it&#x27;s going to put those people in harm&#x27;s way.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000313">00:03:13</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Then there are other people telling me about government narratives, and how much they hate Israel. But is it really Israel that you hate? No, it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s not Israel as a plot of land. It&#x27;s not Israel as a government. It&#x27;s not Israel as a military.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Israel is a territory, meaning it&#x27;s a territory of non-Israeli-born people in general - never has been since the country name was mentioned in biblical times. It has never, ever been the Israeli people, nor the Jewish people or anything, or the Islamic people in another country. It has never been any of those people.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000401">00:04:01</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But it seems to me that even from people that watch the reports, they want to tell me that what I&#x27;m saying is, &quot;Oh, you don&#x27;t understand, Israel&#x27;s doing this.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Israel&#x27;s not doing anything at all. The Israeli government&#x27;s not doing anything - Netanyahu&#x27;s not doing anything.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, to be fair, let&#x27;s just kind of lay it out there. As I said the other day, every government - because we&#x27;re live now - so there is no president, head of state, prime minister, House of Representatives, parliaments, dumas, or otherwise, who have not participated in what you would consider to be unsavory practices, and special parties where there are underage people present.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000455">00:04:55</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I&#x27;m trying to say this as politically correct as I can for this channel that we&#x27;re on. There are no people in government who do not have what they call a &quot;blackmail file.&quot; Blackmail files are created before anyone becomes head of state. And they start doing that when they decide - years ahead of time - who is going to be the head of state.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I&#x27;ve said this several times, yet I still get emails and texts saying, you know, &quot;Israel is bombing Syria.&quot; No, Israel is not bombing Syria. Israel is being used to bomb Syria currently at this moment. They are also used to bomb Iran. They were also used to do a lot of things in the Middle East.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000545">00:05:45</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They are also one of the few countries in the world who did not sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Israel is bombing Syria right now. That&#x27;s what someone wanted to inform me of that the other day. So that was actually yesterday.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Number 1, obviously we get the information in real time, so this isn&#x27;t new for us. Number 2, about a year ago - and I will reiterate this information because it&#x27;s important right now:</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">What is important to the actual Deep State? Now, pretty much every head of state is a Deep State actor. What does that mean to be a Deep State actor? That means you actually take a job with a script, just like you do in Hollywood, and you talk on TV. That&#x27;s what you do. You don&#x27;t make any decisions whatsoever on your own.

<div class="line">It doesn&#x27;t matter if you are from Tonga, Togo, the United States, Russia, Israel, Syria, Iraq, Iran, UK, you know, you don&#x27;t like those people talking on TV, and that&#x27;s fine.</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">As far as militaries are concerned - and we&#x27;re going to take a little bit of a deep dive into militaries today - just to reiterate and put some information together for you so that you understand that no decision has ever been made to bomb a country by any member of the military. Ever. Or to create a war, or to end a war. No one. Ever.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">No one ever won a war. No military that you have seen in the public has ever won a war. No country has ever won a war. Because it isn&#x27;t really a war. These things are all pre-decided and pre-determined - up to decades ahead of time. This is not - this is for your entertainment. Unfortunately, it harms a lot of people, and I understand that.</div>

<div class="line">But you have to come to terms with where we are at. Because really, the reason why we do these reports is, well, yes, sometimes we play with the Deep State a little bit - sure we do. But really, I put these reports out for you. For the people. Because it&#x27;s time. It&#x27;s time for you to understand that your focus on all of these things is not going to change your life. It&#x27;s not going to change the world. You are not going to get on a plane - although some people have - and try to fight a fake war with somebody.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, it&#x27;s real when you&#x27;re on the ground, and I understand that. But it doesn&#x27;t... No one helps or harms the situation. No one. No soldier. No one.</div>

<div class="line">I understand that there are many young adults that join the militaries all across the world - and in some countries, many young children that join the military, too. I understand they believe they&#x27;re fighting for their freedom, their country, their family, their family legacy. I understand all of that. But honestly, it&#x27;s a waste of time. Really, it is.</div>

<div class="line">See, if I was going to say one thing to military personnel all around the world, I would tell you that you are putting yourself in harm&#x27;s way. And I can tell you it&#x27;s not for God, it&#x27;s not for country, and it&#x27;s certainly not for the freedom of your family and loved ones. It&#x27;s not. It never has been.</div>

<div class="line">I&#x27;m going to tell you more about why I know that is true, today. I thought I&#x27;d take a little bit of time to give information that would be relevant to help you make those decisions if you are with the military, or thinking about joining the military.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I thought it would also be prudent to send the people that keep sending me these messages like &quot;Israel bombed Syria. Oh, no!&quot; It is &quot;Oh, no!&quot; because people are harmed. But they, both sides, agreed to do this - actually, they didn&#x27;t agree to do anything - they were told to do it:</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">&quot;This is now going to happen,&quot; they basically said.</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And it&#x27;s all a part of a much larger &quot;war,&quot; so to speak, that&#x27;s actually being played out, that involves very few humans on this planet. And the ones that are involved have no clue what they&#x27;re fighting for. They don&#x27;t even have a clue where to go.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, honestly, until we say something, they don&#x27;t have a clue, whether that&#x27;s me talking to you on a report, or it&#x27;s me talking to someone on the phone. You know, sometimes I call Tom Melville and talk to him on his phone. Sometimes I call other people. I have conference calls with some other people. Sometimes I&#x27;m having a talk in a different way and they interrupt those messages and signals - or try to anyway - to get information as to where to go and what to do and when to do it.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001135">00:11:35</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Do they have information that comes into their brain at one point in time? Yes, they did. They would get information uploaded into their brain as to where to go and what to do.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now that hasn&#x27;t been happening for a while, so everything that you see play out right now is a part of a very old plan - information that is not in real time - it&#x27;s not happening in real time. They know about certain days and times when they believe that things may or may not happen. And it&#x27;s quite frankly driving the world into the toilet, because they refuse to give up any kind of power or control.</div>

<div class="line">Now, I&#x27;d like to talk a little bit about &quot;power and control&quot; for a second, because power and control of a planet or a country is not what you might think it is.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And it&#x27;s obvious to me that a lot of you don&#x27;t understand that when you tell me that &quot;the people are going to fix the country&quot; of, for example, Russia, or Germany, or America, or UK. Also, you tell me that... tells me that you probably haven&#x27;t been there in some cases, because every country is different. China is very different than the United States, even though they&#x27;re run by the same people.</div>

<div class="line">You&#x27;re going to tell me, &quot;No, I vote - who&#x27;s going to vote?&quot; &quot;We lost the 2020 election because it was rigged.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">My God, can I stop hearing that on the internet, please? Because it doesn&#x27;t matter - you&#x27;ve never voted for anything.</div>

<div class="line">You know, maybe you voted in your parent-teacher conferences as to whether or not you were going to keep the lunchroom open for another hour or something. Maybe you voted amongst your communities as to whether or not you were going to spend money collectively as a group to fix a pothole or something, you know? Or something larger in your community.</div>

<div class="line">Until really, truly, COVID happened, and the pandemic happened, and we were locked down - there wasn&#x27;t a whole lot of influence on your life, other than the fact that there&#x27;s taxes and, you know, they&#x27;re high, and we don&#x27;t like them, as people in general. We think we&#x27;re going to argue about where our taxpayer dollars are going, but you really aren&#x27;t, really, in any way.</div>

<div class="line">And I thought I would take this live, to kind of explain that to people. Because we are appearing... and they copy a lot of our stuff, and they put it on a lot of different news channels, where there are a lot of other people on there that are not talking about anything we&#x27;re talking about. And they probably think, well, we want to hear about what&#x27;s the military action that&#x27;s going to take place.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And matter of fact, leading up to the events of July 1st was one day. Also, leading up to the events that were supposed to happen on the 15th of July, which was just a few days ago - every single channel was telling you the same thing: Military action is happening. Trump is going to do this. That&#x27;s going to happen.</div>

<div class="line">And where are we now? You know, you get all excited for a couple of weeks. &quot;We have the latest intel,&quot; [says] ex-CIA person that tells you they&#x27;re an ex-CIA person. You can probably speculate - insert name here - as to who is telling you this stuff. And then we see nothing. We see nothing.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Why do people continue to listen? Well, I&#x27;ll tell you why: Drama. People love drama. It&#x27;s the whole reason why TMZ exists. And all of these magazines that talk about what stars do when they&#x27;re not online, and who&#x27;s dating who, and who&#x27;s divorcing who, and all of this stuff.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">We love drama. We just do. We watch it in movies. Half of our entertainment is drama. Half of the things that happen on TikTok is drama.</div>

<div class="line">I&#x27;ve never seen more - and I&#x27;m not saying that this is a positive in any way, shape, or form, so don&#x27;t take it the wrong way - but I&#x27;ve never seen more sick people, depressed people, formerly addicted people. Doesn&#x27;t anybody just talk about anything else?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, losing loved ones. I mean, it is the most depressing thing if you&#x27;re not buying insert-latest-trend here. So if you&#x27;re either shopping or you&#x27;re watching somebody&#x27;s tragedy or something like that. I mean, occasionally you might see some kind of a tarot card reader or music, someone playing some music or something like that. But for the most part, a lot of it is just drama.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It creates fear, in two minutes or less [chuckle]. But I guess that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s designed to do.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001748">00:17:48</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I&#x27;m telling you all of these things because the government is no different. The government is designed to create drama narratives: to tell you to feel a certain way; to do a certain thing; to stay in line, to stay under control; to tell you how powerful their police forces are, their militaries are. And if you step out of line, these are the people that are going to come after you.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They are not here to protect you in any way, shape, or form. None of these organizations are created to protect you.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001817">00:18:17</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, to be fair, there are a lot of good people who join military, or they join a police force - in any country, insert-name here, it doesn&#x27;t matter which one - that do have the intention of doing the right thing. You know, they get up every day and they want to save lives. They want to do a good job.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Just like doctors. They get up every day and they want to save lives. Unfortunately, they&#x27;re not given the correct information. They&#x27;re given a limited amount of knowledge in 7 or 8 years of school, and that is all they know.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001853">00:18:53</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So if we&#x27;re going to change the world, these are fundamental truths that you&#x27;re going to have to come to terms with and come to grips with.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Most of the people that are reporting to me that there was a bombing in Syria and Israel bombed Syria are nowhere near there. I don&#x27;t even think if I gave them a map of the world that they could point out where Syria actually is, which accounts for a lot of people.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But they like to, I don&#x27;t know, send me the fear? I&#x27;m not sure what they&#x27;re trying to tell me, because we get the information. That would set off an alarm in the system, and we get that information in real time.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001940">00:19:40</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So it looks like this is broken too... Anyway, I was gonna use the whiteboard to explain a few things to you, but that&#x27;s not gonna happen now [laughing]. It&#x27;s just one tragedy after another today, I gotta tell you - as it relates to getting this report out!</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But I need you to understand these fundamental truths. And I&#x27;m going to give you more information as to why I think the things I do, and why I am hoping you understand that the best thing that you can do for yourself and your family, honestly, is focus on taking care of each other. Taking care of people in your community, and then spread it out further than your community to your province.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">This is the way humanity is going to move forward.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002035">00:20:35</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Unfortunately, they have divided all of us by color, by nationality, and nobody trusts anybody anymore. And that&#x27;s all by design.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I mean, in a lot of places we don&#x27;t even trust our neighbors, or the people at the local store - that too is a program and a human experiment.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">See, because they know that if we all get together and we believe the same things, meaning general love and care for one another, meditation or prayer - however you reach the Creator - the whole world would change.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002119">00:21:19</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So this report is going to be a little bit different because it has a larger reach. And I know we&#x27;re live, and obviously things are breaking constantly [chuckle] - I&#x27;m going to give this pen away because it&#x27;s not working, and they&#x27;re trying to fix it live on air. But that&#x27;s okay - that&#x27;s part of being live. Okay.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002145">00:21:45</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So let&#x27;s talk a little bit about the situation in Syria. We talked for a while about one of the largest deep underground military bases that ever existed on this planet. It&#x27;s not the largest one, but it is one of the largest ones. Why is it one of the largest ones? Because much like Durango was - I guess, Colorado for a little while - it was also one of the largest places in the Omniverse where you could travel literally to every density and every dimension from that location.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002222">00:22:22</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Were there a lot of humans that got to participate? Well, yeah. On the one hand, there were a lot of the SSP militaries - and please do not confuse the Secret Space Program militaries with the U.S. government face-front Space Force - they are not the same. They&#x27;re not even close to the same. The people that work there are given very little information. And again, they are there to be the front for many operations.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Originally, the Space Force in the United States was created in order to get funding from the U.S. government in some of the bills that were funded during the Trump administration - which we did from this office. Believe me or don&#x27;t believe me, but that&#x27;s what happened.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002316">00:23:16</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">See, because black-ops money was drying up. And that&#x27;s a multi-trillion dollar a year black-ops program - the Secret Space Program is - and so they had to throw in a real space program, make you think they&#x27;re doing some progress here. It&#x27;s no different than all the way back to the days of JFK and walking on the moon [chuckle].</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Did NASA send people to the moon? No, NASA did not send people to the moon. People had been going back and forth to the moon for thousands of years, really. And remember, once you leave here, time is almost irrelevant. Time travel means you&#x27;re moving from one place to another at a rapid rate. That&#x27;s it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It means you understand time-space continuums and a lot of quantum physics - and you have permission to do so. And that&#x27;s part of the thing that has been changing.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002413">00:24:13</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But as far as Syria is concerned, they believe that this area showed signs recently of coming back online, and therefore everybody wants control of it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, if you are Israel, that means you are fighting for the Order of the Dragon - you are fighting for the Rothschilds. You are fighting for the color blue in the Prime Wars. Now have you ever heard anything about the color blue? Other than maybe you&#x27;ve got some Democrats and some Republicans - and that&#x27;s all part of the war too.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002451">00:24:51</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But the main war on this planet is between different groups of people. Some people believe that they are fighting for the Light because they were designated to play that role. And I&#x27;m talking about even the Secret Space Program folks - some of them firmly believe they get up every day and they&#x27;re fighting for the Light. They are fighting the other half of the same group in the same organization, it&#x27;s just like wars, you know, regular human wars. Because those people are fighting for the quote-unquote &quot;Dark Side.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And then you&#x27;ve got a bunch of people in the middle that can fight on either side called &quot;the neutrals&quot; - which everybody wants to control.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002533">00:25:33</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">As far as you are concerned, you are not privy to any of this information until we give it to you. Because when I say &quot;we,&quot; I&#x27;m talking about me [chuckle]. You&#x27;ve never heard about a lot of this. You&#x27;ve heard about a lot of deep underground military bases, human experimentation, Project Blue Beam, and Project Paperclip, and a lot of Nazi programs, and all of that.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But I can tell you - long before any of these people ever existed, long before there was a United States - the human experimentation and deep underground military bases existed. Long before we had militaries, these things existed. People were kidnapped, just like in Syria. There were over, oh, I don&#x27;t know, probably close to 100,000 people underneath there in jail cells in Syria.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002634">00:26:34</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And I can see we&#x27;re breaking up again. See, welcome to a Live Report with Kim - they don&#x27;t want me to tell you any of this, I guess.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But yes, all of these people that went missing during many wars in the Middle East - not just wars in Syria - I&#x27;m talking about people that were kidnapped from Iraq, people that were kidnapped from Iran. And matter of fact, we even gave the countries over there the two locations that they could access these facilities and get their citizens back.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002712">00:27:12</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Do you know how many people went there and made an attempt to rescue anyone? Including the alleged new Syrian government that people tried to tell me are not on the program - but I can firmly tell you that they are - because some of those locations were not too far from there, and they could have gone there, and gone in there to get people out.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, is it spooky in there? Is it weird in there? It&#x27;s not as weird as it was, I can tell you that right now. But that&#x27;s because it has a lot of portals to other places. People called them &quot;demon-like experiences&quot; that they had near some of those locations.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They opened the doors. Did anybody leave? No, they&#x27;re petrified. They&#x27;ve seen the things that walk around down there.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002805">00:28:05</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I&#x27;m not telling you anything that you probably can&#x27;t find somewhere. Someone had to release this information on some tube somewhere, some social media site. Maybe they haven&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t know.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But the point is, no government cares about its citizens. You can insert-rebel-group here - doesn&#x27;t matter who they side with. You know, there&#x27;s all kinds of rebel groups in the Middle East. There&#x27;s a lot of them in Eastern Europe. There&#x27;s a lot of them in Asia. There&#x27;s a lot of them in the United States - we call them the Patriot community - they&#x27;re supposed to be fighting for freedom. They&#x27;re not fighting for anything - you&#x27;re going around in a circle - and I&#x27;m sorry to say that, but you are.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002859">00:28:59</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They keep talking about - over here, you know - they keep talking about sending people to Gitmo. They use all the big names and that&#x27;s supposed to make you happy. &quot;Releasing the Epstein list&quot; will tell you - in your mind, if you are not aware - that the government is now protecting our kids.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Meanwhile, the second that they get off Twitter and everywhere else, they bring in a young man or a young woman and, well, you know what happens. Epstein Island is not the only island. There are thousands of islands in the Caribbean that are privately owned, and a lot of them have a lot of parties. Epstein is just one.</div>

<div class="line">Gitmo is not designed to be a detention facility - I&#x27;ve said this for years. Gitmo has a deep underground military base underneath it: those people that go there are often used to feed the Elite.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Organs, if they need an organ replacement, or any kind of special medical treatment, adrenochrome, you name it. The people that they take there as a prisoner that are allegedly terrorists and otherwise - it&#x27;s a med spa down there. Stem cells, you name it.

<div class="line">And you know where I heard that from? The actual being that ran this planet. He laughed. He had a submarine. He used to go there all the time when he would travel in such a way, and I wouldn&#x27;t call it a normal submarine, between you and I. But he used to take women, you know - remember, a lot of these beings inhabit human bodies from time to time. You know, they want to have the &quot;human experience,&quot; they call it. And this particular version loved to have women; loved to take women onto submarines, and travel around for four or five months, and do all the things. And a lot of them were quite young.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">At the same time, they also eat people. So there&#x27;s that.</div>

<div class="line">I guess we don&#x27;t have a whiteboard - I was going to actually draw pictures of exactly how ingress and egress works with deep underground military bases, but let&#x27;s talk about it anyway - apparently they broke my pencil on the iPad [chuckling]. So yeah, we could go old school and grab one somewhere around here - I don&#x27;t even know where it is these days - I&#x27;ve been using that one for so long now.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003258">00:32:58</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">OK, so let&#x27;s talk about deep underground military bases for a little while.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Are there human beings that are going to deep underground military bases to save babies and children? No. Nope. The humans wouldn&#x27;t dare do something like that, really. They wouldn&#x27;t - they operate on their levels. They are permitted, as scientists and other people that work underneath there, to bring people in and out for human experimentation, sure.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But are they actually doing anything? No. Nobody is down there saving any babies.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003343">00:33:43</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Deep underground military bases. If there are humans that are not working in conjunction with those sites, and haven&#x27;t worked in conjunction with those sites, that are not of use to the people that actually run those bases that are going in and out - they are definitely used either as food - there are a lot of species that cohabitate in deep underground military bases that eat people, you know, they are a delicacy - or they are being utilized for further control over the human race.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Meaning, mind-control programs: what works, what doesn&#x27;t work. Uhh, social - you know, there are companies, when they&#x27;re going to launch a new product, they do something called a focus group. Have you ever heard about these? They are consumer focus-group companies - all over the world.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003441">00:34:41</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And they will take the latest frying pan or the latest mascara or the latest shoes and tell them what the shoes do or what the frying pan does and why it&#x27;s different and that kind of thing. And then these consumers all experiment with whatever it is, and they will tell them what they like about it and what they don&#x27;t like about it. And with a certain approval rating, it means that it&#x27;s time to launch the product, whatever it is.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003510">00:35:10</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So that being said, you can consider these people that are kidnapped and taken there as unwilling consumer focus groups. You know, how to alter DNA. Do these diseases work? Are they what you call hot-spreading diseases, cold-spreading diseases? One means that when it hits the air, it burns out very quickly, meaning it won&#x27;t spread unless it either has a human host - or even if it does, it doesn&#x27;t stay on the human skin for a long period of time - or it&#x27;s a cold-burning virus. Meaning, well, it can stay around for a long time, let&#x27;s just say, and it has the ability to infect a lot of people.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003557">00:35:57</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They do experimentations, not only with DNA and not only with mind control, but also... humans have a lot of unique abilities, and I&#x27;ve been telling you this for a few years now. Meaning, you do not need a - in your unencumbered form - you do not need a tin can to go from one planet to another. You never did.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">In your unencumbered form, you can manifest at will, without hindrance from a simulation. You can create children in a way that may seem abnormal to you - without a petri dish and a tube and a this and a... or a spouse, or a partner - you can do that.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003656">00:36:56</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You can do a lot of things. And other species would like to be like you. So therefore, they do a lot of work, to either be like you, or to be able to control you.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, one of the programs that you may or may not be aware of that came from these deep underground military bases would be a full consciousness-control program set against all of you. They actually use your consciousness to create your environment.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But is it really yours? You see, they take all of the things that you would desire, pray for, try to manifest at one point in time, and they twist that consciousness around to be the exact opposite. They had tremendous amounts of satellites that would feed information to bases that are corresponding.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003755">00:37:55</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, you have to remember, these deep underground military bases, once you get below Level 6, that&#x27;s all not humans. No humans go there. Even the Secret Space Program folks that travel on and off planet, that go from their own base to another base, are only permitted to see certain things.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I know they feel like they&#x27;re in charge; they&#x27;re in control; they know everything that&#x27;s going on. Well, you&#x27;re wrong. I&#x27;ve been telling the Deep State that for a long time: they&#x27;re wrong.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003827">00:38:27</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I&#x27;ve seen them [Other beings] use them [the SSP] to achieve an agenda and an outcome.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I&#x27;ve seen them [Other beings] get them [the SSP] to run around in circles, until we literally burn this planet to the ground, or they burn it to the ground.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They [Other beings] tell them [the SSP] that they&#x27;re going to implement a new way, a new type of government, a One World Government, and that &quot;you&#x27;re going to be in charge&quot; - because every one of them will buy it. Their ego is huge. Huge - they should be in charge. I mean, they&#x27;ve been going in and out of these sophons - traveling between bases and wormholes happens between a photon to a photon - it creates an environment where humans can live.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Someone didn&#x27;t go there with a crane and construct a deep underground military base.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003925">00:39:25</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And a lot of times, people that are talking to people in these locations are talking to humans, because they had technology to actually put information into your head. Even the SSP did. They could give you an entire thought, a dream. They sure miss their dream program, as of today, for the ninth time.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So this is a constant battle. They think that they&#x27;re battling for power and control. They think that some of these people that use them for experiments - them too - would give them great power. I can tell you right now that that is never going to happen.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004020">00:40:20</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The deep underground military bases I&#x27;m referring to are pretty much in every single country. You hear about a few, a little bit of information about the ones in Denali, people hear about Area 51, 52, you also hear about laboratories in the U.S. But nobody really talks about all the ones in Crimea. Nobody talks about the ones in Ukraine. Nobody talks about the ones in Russia, Syria, Iraq, Iran, China, China, China - there&#x27;s a lot of stuff in China. Australia, Cameroon, Senegal, Saudi Arabia. They&#x27;re everywhere.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Every country, every land mass on this planet has them. And each one of those works in cooperation with all of the others.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004118">00:41:18</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Was our first Secret Space Program invented with Project Blue Beam? Absolutely not. No. Matter of fact, all of these deep underground military bases with humans or non-humans also have access to things like the Pentagon - in restricted areas where people can&#x27;t go.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Why do they have access? Because they run it - they run the Pentagon. The military is not coming to save you because they have not been ordered to come and save you. Matter of fact, they&#x27;ve been ordered to come and kill you. For $50,000 U.S. dollars a head.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It has been like that since the advent of the United States military. Same thing goes for MI6 and UK and CIA and Russian SVR and GRU and the old KGB and China Secret Service and SAS in South Africa and Egypt. And Gaddafi wasn&#x27;t saving the world. And all of these places and all of these people are not here to help you in any way.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And they&#x27;re not here to do anything that they&#x27;re not told to do by something or someone or some AI system somewhere else.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004232">00:42:32</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So why do we talk so much about - because this is the other thing I&#x27;ve heard too, you know? &quot;You&#x27;re talking about all this stuff, but we need real-world information.&quot; Well, I&#x27;m actually giving you the real-world information. I am. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s really happening.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The fight is not with Trump - I could care less. Orange... apparently, dead people have chronic venal insufficiency. Well, all dead people have chronic venal insufficiency [laughing] - I told you that a few years ago. I don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s playing that role, and nor do I care.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The only thing I can tell you is that I am not here to help the United States government survive. Because that is not what they&#x27;re doing. They tell you they&#x27;re here for the people. &quot;We are the people party.&quot; &quot;Trump&#x27;s the people people.&quot; &quot;We like the patriots.&quot; We like all the things.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004332">00:43:32</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Why don&#x27;t you tell that to the thousands of people that followed orders and instructions, as patriots - that have been sitting in jail for years now?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Deny, deny, deny, reassess blame. Why don&#x27;t you tell it to all those people that are in jail? Because they showed up in Chewbacca bikinis and stormed the Capitol building and they were told that they would have protection. They were told that this will not happen. They were paid for their acting role to show up in ridiculous costumes and go to the Capitol building and they&#x27;re all in jail.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">That&#x27;s your government, guys. Get a grip.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004414">00:44:14</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Deep underground military bases are also used for traveling. You know, there are certain bases... like for example, you would think that, oh, these are deep underground military bases; these are these restricted areas with the big fences.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">What if I told you there&#x27;s a deep underground military base in nowhere... underneath the Kellogg&#x27;s main factory? What does that say about your food supply?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, there&#x27;s some movie out, I can&#x27;t remember what it&#x27;s called, but it&#x27;s like a parody about the fight between Post and Kellogg, and they&#x27;re in the same town or founded in the same town, and something about Pop-Tarts or something - but anyway, I didn&#x27;t really watch it. But underneath that whole thing - everybody&#x27;s going back and forth and back and forth. And there&#x27;s some really strange machines there that do strange things to food, guys. Really strange things to your food. It&#x27;s there for that reason.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004519">00:45:19</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The same thing goes for all of your other big food suppliers. They have deep underground military bases where the poison is then delivered. For us to consume. Tyson factories, all kinds of... Dole, in Pakistan, is another one.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And all of your militaries participate.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So the stuff they tell you they&#x27;re doing - the people that lost their jobs during that couple of years of whatever you want to call it...</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004557">00:45:57</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, people yell about chemtrails all the time. There are bigger things at play here. And I say - don&#x27;t get me wrong, I hate them too. I have essential oils I keep on hand, a little mix I did to prevent allergies and heavy metals and all kinds of different things, just because I don&#x27;t want that stuff in my body.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But also, you&#x27;ve got to consume food. You&#x27;ve got to eat food. Even though it says &quot;all organic&quot; - is it really? Probably not. And the price has gone up significantly.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004632">00:46:32</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So what can you do? You can yell at your government. You know, &quot;Trump&#x27;s not what we thought he was!&quot; Well, I could have told you that. I told you that years ago, but nobody wanted to believe me because everybody on the internet wants to be a patriot and fight with some Orange People.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And all they&#x27;ve done is charge us tariffs - we can&#x27;t get stuff into this country now. So you know what, guys? The price of everything is going up - we are only starting to see the tip of the iceberg.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004703">00:47:03</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">If you want to do something, you will not take out a deep underground military base. You won&#x27;t do it. I can tell you that because there is junk under there that you don&#x27;t understand, and if you actually go there and try to storm the place, they will kill you.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So how do you fight what&#x27;s happening? You create something where you can feed yourself and your community. Where are you going to source flour from? Can you get farmers to sell you grain? Can you create some kind of a small machine to mill the flour if you need to?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">This is where we&#x27;re going right now. Because as long as there are SSP people running your governments - which they are, they&#x27;re trying anyway, God bless their... people... I don&#x27;t know, there&#x27;s no disease or mental disorder that I could call that and pull it off, because then I would be insulting those people with those disorders. Because there&#x27;s nothing... you could call out schizophrenia, or all [other] kinds of mental disorders, to try to describe these people, but there&#x27;s not a word in the English language or probably any other language to describe what&#x27;s wrong with their head.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004826">00:48:26</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But if they continue on the path that they&#x27;re continuing on, which is hunting down portals - I tell them where to go, they go there. Do they see a signal? Sure, they do. You know, Thule base in Greenland, again. I keep sending them to the same damn place over and over and over again, and they keep running to that place.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But the unfortunate part is, this is not going to... this is not getting us anywhere. You know, we lure them in - we even, in the last, I&#x27;d say, four or five days, we have even drawn out those sophon bases from other locations back to Earth - and they couldn&#x27;t get out.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">We&#x27;re trying to get rid of them, but I&#x27;ve got to tell you, as long as they have hope - which we do sometimes, we give them hope, sometimes - we tell them where to go so that we can get them.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004933">00:49:33</div>

<div class="line">You know, you tell everybody you are weak when you are strong: Sun Tzu.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">&quot;Oh God, these SSP people are killing me!&quot; You know, are they really? No. You recharge, you reboot, you do what you&#x27;ve got to do to protect yourself, and I&#x27;ve become pretty accustomed to doing that. Do I know that they send frequencies through our Wi-Fi, our cellphones, and all that kind of stuff? Do I know that they have special ones that they try to send to me all the time? Yes, I do. I laugh when the internet goes out and I&#x27;m trying to do a live report.</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-005013">00:50:13</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So what is it? If I would say there is one thing that the Deep State does not want me to tell you, that is: you need to think of this planet as if you own it. I want you to look at yourself in the mirror, without ego, please, and say, &quot;I am the President of the United States. Now, what am I going to do?&quot; What is the President of the United States, or the Prime Minister of the UK, or the President or Prime Minister of Australia or South Africa - what are they to you? What are they supposed to be to you? And what are you going to do about it? Some of you might look at yourself and say, &quot;I&#x27;m going to change the law.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m going to ban taxes.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m going to ban the IRS.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005109">00:51:09</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Honey, you are not going to be worried about the IRS and paying taxes when you can&#x27;t eat! They have told you on their social media, on Twitter, on X, that they want to destroy America. They have said it - this is your Q community. &quot;MAGA is gone - we&#x27;re going to destroy America now - we talked to the scriptwriter, and this is what he told us to do.&quot; How far are they going to take it? How many of them are there left? And they&#x27;re recruiting all the time. I actually listened to a recruiting call the other day. They recruit hackers. They recruit people. They tell them how special they are, how amazing they are - and they recruit them to work in these programs.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005157">00:51:57</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">How many people are going to fall for it? Well, it seems to me like a lot of them do. They recruit other people who are doing YouTube channels and that type of thing - to give you all this wonderful information that you deem secret intel, all this other kind of stuff - and do that to distract you from doing what you need to do.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">We are not that far away. And I can tell you, we can hold them off, by sending them around - because you can&#x27;t kill them all - they just do another recruiting session and everybody thinks it&#x27;s a great freaking idea.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, they&#x27;ll dip into the pockets of the CIA, the NSA, DARPA. Young kids in the military, recruit them. Soldiers. They go to other countries, do it in other ways, in other places - they threaten people, blackmail people - all kinds of stuff to make them do what they want them to do.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005255">00:52:55</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Because remember, we are the slaves - we are supposed to work for them, in their mind.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So we can hold them off and we can keep them going around in a circle until a day ending in Y, because it&#x27;s working. All you got to do is tap into some AI system, and an old comm line, and be like, &quot;I am Lucifer.&quot; They like that. &quot;I am Lucifer,&quot; you know, and project a hologram or something like that, on a holographic phone like the ones they have in Greenland at that base. &quot;You have been chosen to wait until August 1st [laughing], oooh... when I shall return.&quot; [hearty laughter]</div>

<div class="line">It&#x27;s funny, but it works - every time! You can drive these people around in circles, over and over and over again. And they just fall for it every time. You just can&#x27;t be me - if it&#x27;s me that calls, then they&#x27;re like, oh, and hang up the phone. But they&#x27;ll listen to insert-character-here that they like. They like those people, okay, we&#x27;ll do this one today.</div>

<div class="line">But it&#x27;s not gonna last for a long time. Everything is starting to really fall apart. It took a lot longer than I thought it was going to, but it really is falling apart. Governments are falling apart. They are using operatives, giving them fake bonds and fake cash, and traders and bankers - fake cash and promises of days ending in Y. I believe the next day... today, was one of those days everybody went crazy for a while, yelling and screaming, blah, blah, blah.</div>

I&#x27;m not trying to sell myself here or anything like that, but I give you what&#x27;s really going on, and then you&#x27;re seeing it play out in the mainstream media. I tell you before it happens. Sometimes it comes out in the mainstream media, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t - they certainly don&#x27;t want to prove me right sometimes. But it&#x27;s true.</div>

You know, I do have some good friends and some family, but for the most part, I don&#x27;t really talk to a whole lot of people about this, what I do every day. I try to be normal [chuckle], have lunch and do things whenever I get a chance, but it has been a rarity in the last several months.</div>

It&#x27;s the time to figure out how to lower the price of food, how to lower the price of clothing, how to lower the price of goods in your country - especially in America, because this is target number 1. And if America goes, everybody else will go as a byproduct.</div>

<div class="line">Monika-P:  Hi Kim, happy to talk to you today. I&#x27;ve been thinking a lot about pretty clear ways of collective - I call it blatantly, stupidity. I see stupid behavior in the streets, I listen to many stupid answers where you see people don&#x27;t really follow or they really don&#x27;t process information that much anymore. So I thought about what could be... if I ask a question to Source Creator, I would suggest to him to send a scalar light codes - codes that would amplify the energetic system in the physical vessel again. So people basically, they need to wake up, I feel. I think the brain has a problem more than ever. And I wonder if you could share your thoughts on my idea, basically. Or it&#x27;s not my idea. I heard about the sun being a very potent information transmitter from [Dr.] Jere Rivera, who said that basically when the sun goes up, and when the sun goes down there&#x27;s a special angular momentum from the sun rays that&#x27;s very promoting the deuterium in the water. The water molecules are basically infested by a certain type of... molecular crap, let&#x27;s call it - it&#x27;s called deuterium. And when the sun hits in the right way, it really will reorganize in a real pure H2O molecule geometry. So I thought maybe the potential could be raised a little bit, and not only in the morning and in the evening, but really come on full scale. Maybe that&#x27;s an idea you could think about.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010602">01:06:02</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim:  Well, and it&#x27;s not something that we haven&#x27;t thought about and haven&#x27;t tried to do. There&#x27;s a certain amount of sovereignty, first of all, where it would make us no better than others, let&#x27;s just say, that came before us, if we were to... send you information, as an example. And we can talk on a channel like this and people can choose to listen or not listen, but if we were to do something like that, then they don&#x27;t really have a choice, do they?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And so, allowing for a better connection to the Creator - and let the Creator do what the Creator will - is a whole other thing. But people are going crazier, you know, and I&#x27;ve heard it. It&#x27;s been a very particularly difficult couple of weeks. And honestly, you&#x27;re more in the know - if you&#x27;re watching this, you&#x27;re listening to this - you&#x27;re more in the know than 99% of the people out there. So you can go to a store and you can recognize the behavior and you understand it, and you can say, look, it&#x27;s not their fault, right? You choose how you&#x27;re going to be, and when you feel that coming on, you can say, is it my thoughts? Or is it not my thoughts? Am I having these... why am I angry? I have no reason to be angry. You know, why am I having these reactions? And then you can recenter yourself and make sure that you&#x27;re not participating in what&#x27;s happening.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010747">01:07:47</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But these people, I have to be honest and tell you, I mean, number 1 - and please forgive me, it&#x27;s just one of those days where I&#x27;m just like, really? Again, you know? And I&#x27;m a human too, just like all of you. And I get tired. Not that you can&#x27;t charge up or anything, but sometimes it&#x27;s like, are you still doing this? You&#x27;re still doing this. Like, it makes no sense to me. And really, at this point, it&#x27;s just sadistic, you know, at what they&#x27;re doing to people.</div>

<div class="line">They desperately have been trying for the last 48 hours - really heavily - to control people. There&#x27;s very little left of the simulators. There&#x27;s very little left. There was about... less than you could count on on your hands right now. And they are grabbing at anything and everything they can to try to control people. To cause harm. To try to maintain some kind of control over the human race. And it&#x27;s been coming hot and heavy. So, you&#x27;re probably seeing a lot of people in your peripheral have a lot of emotions they don&#x27;t normally have, have extreme reactions to things, when they&#x27;re normally not those people. And a lot of that has to do with them.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010928">01:09:28</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, the reason for my frustration sometimes with this process - it&#x27;s not like these things haven&#x27;t existed and were not used by others - but the Others understood the technology. These people did not create the technology, and a lot of times it&#x27;s something brand new that they&#x27;re trying to do. They&#x27;ve never used the technology before. If you remember way back in the day, we got the VCR, and then we got the DVD player, and then you got everybody pushing buttons trying to figure out how to use it, right? Well, unfortunately, that just means your movie doesn&#x27;t play. In this particular case, their movie is real. You are in the movie, whether you want to be in the movie or not. It really affects sleep patterns, frequencies - if you&#x27;re very sensitive, you probably hear them right now, you hear a lot of them - high tones, low tones, coming off and on. Which used to mean a spiritual thing was happening, but in this particular case, it doesn&#x27;t.</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-011032">01:10:32</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s them. And they oftentimes push the pedals to the metal. There&#x27;s no filter, like, &quot;Oh, if we want this, then what we need to do is crank it up as high as it will go.&quot; And in some cases, even the machine will shut them down, because they&#x27;re pushing it so hard. So, when you&#x27;re saying that you&#x27;re seeing people go a little crazy, you know, it&#x27;s worse than ever - it&#x27;s really not their fault. And I know this sounds terrible, but, you&#x27;ve got to try to have a little bit of compassion for these people because it&#x27;s not their fault, and maybe your reaction is a little different to these people.</div>

I say yes and I&#x27;m only getting...</div>

<div class="line">Kim:  Well, but humans are very resilient. I mean, if you think of all the things we&#x27;ve been through, you have the ability to repair. You do. If you change our environment, we will adapt, change, and overcome. It might be a little bit chaotic for a while, but it&#x27;s not going to be as chaotic as it&#x27;s been when they&#x27;ve been trying to manipulate us. Remember, two things cannot occupy the same space at the same time. So if there is a program putting consciousness into your head, you are aware that happens. Oh, that happens - it overrides your consciousness is what it&#x27;s designed to do, and keep us more subservient and not able to use our capabilities in a lot of ways.</div>

<div class="line">But the more we correct these situations, the more the wisdom will be able to come directly to your mind, body, and soul. And that&#x27;s on a cellular level, too. So it&#x27;s not just water that&#x27;s in your body. It&#x27;s also, you know, within your minutes: it&#x27;s within your mitochondria, it&#x27;s within your telomeres. You&#x27;ll have the ability to repair where we couldn&#x27;t before. If a human was damaged, or born in a different way, or just different, you know? You&#x27;ll have more of the ability to repair and adjust and change.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s just... we&#x27;re just at this... we&#x27;re in a battle with them, number 1. That part&#x27;s true. But also, I would say, in addition to that, we are also seeing programs come and go - go away, then they come back with a vengeance, and go away. And it&#x27;s so topsy-turvy, it really is driving people a little crazy right now. And I&#x27;ve seen behavior in people that I&#x27;ve known for 10, 20, 30 years, and I&#x27;m like, &quot;Ookaay... Okay.&quot; But you just got to take it for what it is. Recognize that it&#x27;s not you. These people don&#x27;t really want to harm. Humans are not that kind of people in general. You know, the Deep State&#x27;s a whole other story - their brain is fractured, they&#x27;ve got all kinds of things that have happened to them from programs and that kind of thing. But there will be the ability to help guide and repair.</div>

And I try to relay this to people like yourself, that the education division of CARE is so much more than just, &quot;We need to fix our school systems.&quot; And nobody would, at that time - this was a couple of years ago - and nobody was willing to listen to me.

<div class="line">Syl-Laf:  I&#x27;ll go right ahead and ask my question. It&#x27;s in regards to a phenomenon that&#x27;s been going on for probably many decades, and it&#x27;s about crop circles. And we&#x27;ve been seeing them more often recently, and there&#x27;s been many explanations, but not really, I don&#x27;t think, the truth about it. Can you explain what crop circles are?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011715">01:17:15</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim:  Well... There are many things that we see that are done for both positive reasons and negative reasons. And I&#x27;d have to see what it looks like to tell you which one you&#x27;re looking at. I&#x27;ve seen &quot;labyrinths.&quot; I&#x27;ve seen what you would call your &quot;flower of life&quot; patterns. I would say that they are sometimes messages, I can say that. Because there has to be fair and equal ground when, let&#x27;s just say, sometimes when folks do things to us: they have to tell us first. And sometimes those people are human, and sometimes they&#x27;re not human.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011813">01:18:13</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">In other cases, I would say it&#x27;s probably not human communications. And those that are permitted into the &quot;realm,&quot; so to speak, or have figured out a way to bypass that, occasionally send us positive messages too, or try. And for a long time, there was this [consensus that], you can inform or influence, but the people still aren&#x27;t going to do anything. Just watch. That was the general consensus.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">We are seeing that differently now, you know - at least from our side and from our standpoint. We&#x27;re seeing things where people are responding, but the problem is then the information you go to look up is wrong. So if you&#x27;re able to look at these things, and look at them from within - meaning use your inner wisdom, your own discernment, your inner guidance when you see these things. And if it feels bad, it&#x27;s probably bad. We&#x27;re so desperate for something positive or some information, but I would say if it looks bad, it feels bad, when you look from within, then it&#x27;s probably bad. If it feels good, then you have to read it with a different set of eyes.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011944">01:19:44</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, I would take a look at it - if it feels good, then take a look at it. And then really go within, and sit with it for a while and try to figure out what it means. Meaning go from your inner wisdom. And then that will give you the information. And then when you do find the information, if it is good and it is positive, it would be great to share that information with other people. Maybe that&#x27;s a Field Messenger report, or have your own platform.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">No, seriously, because there&#x27;s not a lot of information out there, you know, Natalie. That&#x27;s not... that&#x27;s correct. Yeah. There&#x27;s a lot of garbage out there, and they want to specifically guide people who are just starting to wake up, to send them back to sleep, so to speak. Or put them in fear. There has to be a better way, you know? No pressure Field Messengers if you&#x27;re here.</div>

<div class="line">Christy:  Hi Kim. I hope you&#x27;re holding up well. And my question is: I live in Santa Barbara, which is a beautiful place. We used to be very restrictive with our zoning. But lately it seems like, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s BlackRock, or all these big developers. [They] are ruining all these little seaside towns with these huge high-density housing projects. And I thought BlackRock was broke. I&#x27;m just wondering if you see an end to this before our whole world is just turned so ugly? And then also with CARE, do you see communities getting to choose how to make their places pretty. Thank you. I&#x27;ll get off and just listen.</div>

<div class="line">Kim:  Now, I do understand your plight. There was a time when the same thing kind of happened in Florida, whereby there were all these giant condo towers - ruined the coastline. And I know that that&#x27;s happening a lot in California too these days. But... there, for a long time, there was a lot of Chinese money coming in, even through BlackRock. Outside investors, there are a lot of Middle Eastern folks as well that are investing through BlackRock. As you know, they stole hundreds of billions of dollars from the Mormons recently [chuckle]. And it&#x27;s not a surprise to me that they are doing some real estate development over there. But, I think, the less that they have - and I know people are like, well, we need to have the ability to do our own kind of developing in our way, and we want to see it happen in our communities - and I will, I do agree with you. But this is kind of, you know, sometimes I have to play devil&#x27;s advocate a little bit. Because I look at these big companies and I&#x27;m like, well, no money, no development, right?</div>

<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim:  Okay. So, you know, no money, no development. If you have the money, then you can do the development. And decisions can be made more on a community basis. While I do still believe that they are on a firm path to burn governments to the ground, and our financial system - and changes are happening in the financial system to where we&#x27;re seeing less and less development like that - we also have an affordable housing situation. Especially in California. So their solution to that - because they need to have workers that have lower pay in various areas. They need to live there. So their solution to that is to give everybody a studio apartment, or make affordable housing available.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012440">01:24:40</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So this is something I would take a look at for yourself. You know, think of yourself as the president of your area or the head of your area - what would you do when you start looking at things from all aspects? Right now there&#x27;s no affordable housing really anywhere in the states, and prices are going up for no reason whatsoever. The cost of lumber or wood is very, very expensive in this country right now. Steel is going up. Tariffs are not helping. We have not manufactured a lot of this stuff in the States - because you specifically asked me about the States - we have not manufactured this stuff here in the States in a long time. We import a lot of stuff from Canada. We import a lot of steel from China - which is very substandard at this moment. But anyway, there are prefabricated truss beams and all that kind of stuff that come from outside the country. And I don&#x27;t know how affordable it&#x27;s going to be when it&#x27;s done anyway.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012545">01:25:45</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But there has to be a solution there too, where... we can&#x27;t break the people that are owners of apartments or rental properties either. So there has to be a happy medium here where we figure out a solution in order to rebuild our communities and, like you said, maintain what makes people want to live there in the first place. It shouldn&#x27;t be this expensive.</div>

<div class="line">Rachel:  It&#x27;s about all that is going on regarding the weather and, you know, the earthquakes, the landslides, the floods. We see that there is a crack in the United States that is widening. There is one huge crack in Africa as well. And a lot of that is linked with the chemtrails, the HAARP, and everything. But I believe that it&#x27;s so much - and the volcanoes also, the ring is opening, the volcanoes on the west side of the Earth - what is your thought on all that?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012736">01:27:36</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim:  Well, first of all, there is a little bit of a tit-for-tat and a fight going on with the Secret Space Program. If anybody has the capacity to make a weather change like that, it&#x27;s coming from them. But again, they don&#x27;t even understand what some of this stuff is and what it actually does. Now, as far as chemtrails affecting the weather - the storms that we saw in like Chicago and New Mexico, where there was all this flooding in Texas, that kind of thing - I understand that, and that was them. 100%. They even told you, on some of their social media that they were going to do it. And they thought it was funny. They were laughing, really.</div>

<div class="line">But once the bell is rung, you can&#x27;t unring the bell. You know, you can&#x27;t, like, suck the rain back up, or cause a change in a cloud that quickly. But a lot of it&#x27;s done on a molecular level. Is it chemtrails? I don&#x27;t think so. I mean, those are... the original ones were a lot more harmful than the ones that we see today. Not to say they&#x27;re not uncomfortable, but I know that they&#x27;ve been looking for materials to make something that might work. And it&#x27;s mainly about human control, just like you would spray for pests. We are the pests, you know.</div>

<div class="line">As far as HAARP is concerned, HAARP unto itself does not function without the Secret Space Program behind it. It&#x27;s a government program. And the people that run HAARP have a coordinated effort, and a way to employ more people. I mean, I would say more comes out of NORAD in the States - this is for worldwide - than I see coming elsewhere.</div>

<div class="line">The situation with the Ring of Fire. For those of you that don&#x27;t know, the Ring of Fire goes all the way from that crack you talk about in California, all the way over to Asia. So, it surrounds the entire Pacific. Were there some earthquakes in Alaska? Yes. They were within the last few days, I believe - there have been, off and on. But as far as their ability to disrupt the entire Ring of Fire, usually we catch the technology before it gets that far. And there are a lot of people that are aware.</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-013024">01:30:24</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You&#x27;d be surprised how much influence some of these... simulations, and simulators - how much influence they actually have. One minute there&#x27;s no planes in the sky; all of a sudden there&#x27;s planes in the sky and they&#x27;re spraying things. And some guy at a computer somewhere - here or elsewhere - that&#x27;s tapping some keys on a keyboard, and all of a sudden you&#x27;ve got planes spraying things. You know, it is like living in a video game. And we&#x27;ve been in this game for a long time. It&#x27;s not a new thing here on Earth. It&#x27;s not new elsewhere either. But the amount of influence is incredible.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-013113">01:31:13</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, I know they want to tell you on the internet that this is where this is coming from, and that the cracks are widening, and the volcano is erupting. You know, there are volcanoes on this planet that have erupted consistently, a couple of times a year - for decades, if not centuries - and nobody even thinks twice about it. But when you focus on it in the media, you&#x27;re also giving your attention to it, and you&#x27;re creating a collective consciousness - even if you&#x27;re saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t want this.&quot; But the fear alone helps to manifest that into being. It&#x27;s why simulations are actually a byproduct of collective consciousness.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-013209">01:32:09</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So controlling the consciousness and controlling the mind is of utmost importance when they&#x27;re trying to create a simulation. So I caution you, and [where you put] your focus, because... For example... don&#x27;t get me wrong - we don&#x27;t want people to be harmed, and if we have the ability to warn people that we have seen something happening... You know, I would say, now your question would be, &quot;Is it actually widening?&quot; Not from information a government has put out - you&#x27;re talking about the San Andreas Fault, I assume. Not from information that some Deep State person put out - is there anyone that lives in that area? And this is where Field Messengers come in: is there anyone that lives in that area that can actually confirm that that has widened? And if so, how long and by how much? So, in other words, how long did it take to widen? And by how much? And that would give us more of an indication if that is an actual real threat at the moment.</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim:  The plane landed safely elsewhere - the people did not die in a crash. Unfortunately, like most of these orchestrated events, usually they are taken somewhere for a reason, you know, like I just talked about in the GIA report a little bit ago. Usually it&#x27;s either in some experiment or something - and that&#x27;s terrible to say, if you knew someone on the plane.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">When something like this happens - and hopefully it doesn&#x27;t happen very often anymore. I mean, our technology is so bad, I&#x27;m not to say that we won&#x27;t have any kind of mechanical failures in the future. But I mean, honestly, the tracking on that iPhone that you&#x27;re on right now - on James&#x27; iPhone, I mean - you could literally, virtually almost smash it apart, and several hundred meters below the ocean track where it is. That&#x27;s how that technology actually really works.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-013543">01:35:43</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, you mean to tell me, that out of all the passengers on that plane... you know, half of them probably have an Android phone, and maybe some of them don&#x27;t, and the other half have an iPhone. And the surveillance technology required by the NSA, which is global - you know, you have Pine Gap in Australia, you have Five Eyes, Nine Eyes, whatever you call it. The technology that is in that phone is so far advanced for tracking. And it was started with the advent of ECHELON and some of these other technologies that you can read about on the internet, and watch a movie or two - there&#x27;s a lot of it out there. There&#x27;s no way. Absolutely no way. And the only one that could shut them all off like that would be a government. Or someone like DARPA.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So none of that actually made sense to me, in any way, shape, or form - but I&#x27;m assuming that those people were taken underground somewhere. Probably with about 95% certainty. Probably somewhere in Eastern Europe, eventually.</div>

And it&#x27;s not your typical type of crystal - it&#x27;s not like a quartz you would pick up in a shop somewhere. I&#x27;ve seen crystal used for these purposes for communications long before we had cellphones, and that kind of thing. I&#x27;ve seen people that are within the Order actually put a similar-type crystal in the soft spot of a baby&#x27;s head, so that they could communicate with something like that.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Crystals are also used to claim property, and crystals actually have been used... in even your head - not &quot;you&quot; just personally. But I would tell you, at that point in time, they are probably a lot older than they say they are.</div>

And there was a communication that would take place between non-humans and humans - way back in the day, and probably even before Mayan civilizations over there. So they&#x27;re prized and coveted for their knowledge they used to give, let&#x27;s just say.</div>

I don&#x27;t know of anybody that&#x27;s actually found a real one.</div>

<div class="line">Mary-R:  Yes, thank you. Thank you. Yeah, nice to see you, Kim. I was actually in Durango this time last year, visiting for my birthday treat. So I went to some of the coffee shops and bought some souvenirs. So, that was fun. But, hey, so my question is about something you mentioned today: unencumbered humans. Could you tell us more about that? And how close we are to becoming, you said, &quot;unencumbered form.&quot; And how close we are to becoming that? And then also, if that&#x27;s connected to something else you&#x27;d mentioned about becoming a &quot;Citizen of Source.&quot; Are those connected?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-014119">01:41:19</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim:  Well, yes. So, you have you, in Reality - and this is why I tell people to go within your soul. Look within - because that is still, and always will be connected to Reality. It&#x27;s one thing that they couldn&#x27;t touch. They have messed with the mind, the body. They can overlay the soul, but they can&#x27;t affect the soul itself. You know, they can, once it departs the body, they can send it different places, do all kinds of different things, power certain things with your soul. But they cannot actually get into the soul. And they&#x27;ve never figured out how to soul split either.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-014203">01:42:03</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, if you imagine yourself in a hall of mirrors - is the best way I can describe it. And you are in Reality; you know, you can touch your hand, and feel yourself. Mirrors are simulations. So you&#x27;re mirrored hundreds of times. And if you were - actually, millions of times - and if you were able to manipulate that mirror, that is what a simulation does. So firstly, they mirror you out to another location, you know, where a consciousness transfer can take place - of a collective consciousness of a planet - into a simulation. But then they manipulate that consciousness. They can&#x27;t manipulate you in Reality.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-014253">01:42:53</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So what we&#x27;re... Reality is the Kingdom of Source. That is the Kingdom of Source. So without any mirrors, manipulations and overlays on planets in totality, or yourself, then you are now in Reality - therefore you are in the Kingdom of Source. You know, it&#x27;s been an extremely long journey, and we started with millions and millions of simulations, and we&#x27;re down to just a few - and they&#x27;re dying. You know, the dying plan of the simulations is working. With what we started, it&#x27;s only been like a week or so.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So the Deep State does not want to not have a simulation because they cannot control you. And they would like to have power and control. So, case in point, on a regular people level, if you were actually &quot;Make America Great Again,&quot; wouldn&#x27;t you have gotten rid of the Federal Reserve, given the chance? Probably, if you were anywhere in the world - the Federal Reserve affects everywhere. You know, that&#x27;s the financial system, whole reason why we have taxes in every country. You would have gotten rid of something like that. They don&#x27;t want to get rid of it - they want to control it. And just like they don&#x27;t want to get rid of simulations - they just want to control it. They&#x27;ve never had the ability to control them, but they&#x27;ve seen what a small amount of access can do.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-014434">01:44:34</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So the fight for the last several days has been between me and them. And they&#x27;re wanting to control it, and I&#x27;m wanting to get rid of it. And them grasping at any straw they can find at this point. How close to it are we? I hope very close. You know, days like today, I&#x27;m pretty tired [chuckle]. But the more you understand what it is, the more you can find your path, in the interim, to override it yourself, to some degree. You do have the ability to connect with other people on a soul level. You can do... you can communicate with people telepathically - just by changing the frequency of your voice - believe it or not. You have a lot of ability to change the environment more so now than ever. But I think it&#x27;s going to take a lot of teaching these next generations and other people, and that&#x27;s kind of going to be our job. But hopefully, not too much longer - to answer your question.</div>

We&#x27;ve done a few things in my dream state, in-mission style things, as well as healing type things. So if that&#x27;s definitely you, I want to thank you for that.

At least, not our &quot;TV version,&quot; so to speak. But then again, just like humans don&#x27;t look like we used to look - we were taller, we were... Can they change the way people look? Can they change the way an animal looks, like that? Possibly. As far as cities that used to exist, that you would call - I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re talking about the positive ones, right?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-014828">01:48:28</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Julie:  Yep.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-014829">01:48:29</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim:  Yeah. In some ways you could say yes, in some ways you would say no. Because, like we talked about with the crystals - they can be used to send consciousness in one direction or another direction. Crystals can also be used for protection. They were also used as weapons against Dark. And there were wars fought with crystals. They kind of morphed that in the Star Wars thing to the &quot;Lightsaber&quot; thing, but that&#x27;s not really it - it&#x27;s just a crystal. I mean, they had to make it look more whatever, I guess. And they&#x27;re not just any crystal either. You know, they are - it is a type of crystal that was once abundant here and still is kind of abundant in Earth.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-014923">01:49:23</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Those crystals were overshadowed by something that your Secret Space Program calls a Cintamani stone. Cintamani stones don&#x27;t look like the ones that you would buy like on eBay. They are crystals as well, of a sort. They are used to change a... they can be used to change you. They can be used to change organic life. They can be used to project an artificial consciousness, to the point where Earth has an artificial consciousness, and it looks different than it really is. They have used it for that here. Cintamani stones are often placed on territories as well, of non-humans, because of the power of the crystal. So once something, an organic anything, that could be energy, organic energy in a crystal - a specific type, of course - you can then utilize that energy and change an entire planet. You know, you can change a person, if the person is within that crystal. But conversely speaking, you can also use them for your protection. Because if you are within that, and something is not penetrating that, it can be used almost like a shield. And it was used during times of war. We have been at war on this planet a lot.</div>

<div class="line">Kim:  Okay. No, there was no relation. It was not a person. That was a... what you would call... it depends on how you want to say it. But you would say, it was an evil being. And the Emerald Tablets are a very specific type of - not actual emerald...</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-015310">01:53:10</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim:  No, the tablets themselves that are referred to are actually made of a different type of stone - like we were just talking about the crystals - that hold a green essence, and green is often the color of time. So, it&#x27;s the inserting of time somewhere. Or giving information about that particular kingdom, of time. They portray a lot of these beings like Isis and all of this on the internet as a positive thing, and I&#x27;ve never seen it in any way in that way. You know, they&#x27;ve always been quite hostile as far as our actual real history.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-015405">01:54:05</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, honestly, the Melchizedek bloodline is a bloodline of organic humans. You would say that they are, you know, throughout history they have often called these people like &quot;the priesthood&quot; or that kind of thing - but it&#x27;s not even necessarily a religious thing, although some of them have participated in religious contexts, as you&#x27;ve seen. But I would say to you, it is a group of beings that are able to maintain their connection to God or Source, irregardless of all of the places that they would go.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-015453">01:54:53</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, being here on Earth, as an example: there&#x27;s a lot of non-natural things that happen here. So they would be able to maintain that connection regardless of outside interference, or other interference from other people or beings on this planet. They just have that... and it&#x27;s not necessarily like a, you know, DNA, like you would do a DNA test, you know, like a swab in your cheek or something. It would be more of a living DNA of the soul. It&#x27;s just a specific group of humans that, no matter what happens, they&#x27;re always here to some degree. There&#x27;s always some varying amount, between a few hundred to 15,000, 20,000 on this planet at any given moment in time. And they are here to basically fight for Source, fight for the Creator, fight for God, as you would say. That&#x27;s their specific purpose.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-015607">01:56:07</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Some of them wake up and they remember. Some of them have nightmares and dreams as young kids that they were fighting wars before, here and elsewhere, because they are also... they carry what you would call the Sword of Source, and they are oftentimes warriors too. And some of them don&#x27;t wake up. Some of them choose to try to ignore what they see and what they hear because they just want to be normal. So does that give you a little bit, does that answer your question?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-015645">01:56:45</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">C-Hardnett:  I&#x27;m sorry, it does, it does. I was thinking the same thing when I thought of just the things that like the Thoth they&#x27;ll say like, &quot;Oh, I&#x27;m going back to the Halls of Amenti.&quot; I&#x27;m like, well, you know, I thought that was like the spaces in between. So wouldn&#x27;t it be like an AI consciousness or something of the Lower Astral, that would be able to go to those places and exist? So, it makes perfect sense. Thank you so much.</div>

You know, created what they call like the False Heaven, where people think they&#x27;re going to talk to Source and they&#x27;re really not. So you know, I again, I have to say - if you&#x27;re asking my opinion - I would basically say that connecting with the Creator, with the Golden Light of Source, with the... that&#x27;s the answer. That&#x27;s where the answers always come from. And we just have to remember how to do that. That&#x27;s all.</div>

And a lot of these people are, you know, in America you might say it&#x27;s kind of like the older population that has seen the Depression and the run on the banks and that kind of thing. But that&#x27;s actually not true, because the more people kind of wake up, and they hear about these crashing financial systems and all of this stuff, and they get involved with the Patriot community - these people like to have cash on hand. They&#x27;re told to have cash on hand, so they&#x27;ve got cash on hand. They feel more comfortable.</div>

<div class="line">They did experiments, even in America, where they took away the coinage - or tried to - and then they were going to take away the penny and then try to. But then they realized, how are you going to charge tax because everything is like, you know, $7.39, you know, or $9.99, you know. When you add the tax on there, it&#x27;s some odd number - usually ending in a requirement of pennies, right? Remember, there was the change shortage and the cash shortage, and they wanted people to use debit cards and then they tried to caution people saying that it was dirty and you were going to make yourself sick and all this kind of stuff if you use cash. It didn&#x27;t work - people still wanted cash. You know, sorry, they do. And that&#x27;s in America.</div>

<div class="line">Now in the rest of the world, I can tell you that probably somewhere around probably 60% of the countries out there - if we were just to take countries, not the amount of people living there - would pretty much exclusively deal in cash. Because, one of the reasons for that is because it is very expensive... So our credit card, and debit card, and tap and pay, and all the other ways you would transfer coins - stable or otherwise - from one person to another person, or to a merchant, or to pay for something in another country somewhere, the merchant doesn&#x27;t actually get paid for sometimes upwards of almost a month. Because the processing speed is not there. The merchant point-of-sale system is not ready for that type of transacting, peer to peer, worldwide, simultaneously. Even if you were to take a portion of countries that are used to dealing with this type of technology. Meaning, they&#x27;re not going to the local market in Nigeria somewhere trying to get some fruit, right?</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-020238">02:02:38</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Number 2, the processing is extremely expensive. So I know that you&#x27;ve probably seen - even if you&#x27;re in the States, it sounds like you might be in the States - if you are in the States, you would even see, like on larger purchases, they would say - if you intend to use your credit card - the cost will be 5% more, or 3% more on a large purchase. And the reason for that is because it&#x27;s very expensive - and the merchants can&#x27;t lose that 3% or the 5%. It&#x27;s very expensive as a shop owner to do this. And then, how many shop owners - especially smaller shop owners in other countries - can wait two weeks to get paid? I mean, heck, even if you are a merchant in the States, you don&#x27;t get paid right away. On average, it can take up to a week to 10 days for processing. It&#x27;s not like it used to be at all. I mean, we have First Data and WorldPay, and then they have these insurance companies that actually do like a short-term, almost factoring-type thing, where they would pay out, and then collect it from the banks. You know, they&#x27;ll take all your purchases in cards, so to speak, or tap and pay or whatever it is - Apple offers that service and stuff too - and then they charge you a little bit of a percentage for that service, for getting it faster.</div>

<div class="line">So, I mean, even Stripe transactions: it&#x27;s 30 cents a transaction, plus it is a percentage, upwards somewhere between around three to five percent, depending on the amount of transactions you do and that kind of thing. So to say all of a sudden this is going to be a great idea, we&#x27;re going to now go to Bitcoin - insert coin here - this is just because there is no control over the dollar. They need to have a currency that they can control. Period - end of story. And it would be easier to integrate into a worldwide healthcare system where they could control your healthcare and your identification and all of those types of things as a One World citizen.</div>

<div class="line">And in theory, that is a fantastic thought that they have. They always have these thoughts. I call them, and I&#x27;m joking and being facetious when I say &quot;fantastic.&quot; Because they have these amazing thought processes with no idea how to get there, and then everything takes them back to &quot;Well, if we don&#x27;t have this kind of AI processing, then it&#x27;s never going to happen - so now we need to go get an AI again - or maybe we can hack hers.&quot; Meaning the one that we created. They just don&#x27;t understand how the flow of money works.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So for the last couple of days - since I did the last report - they&#x27;ve been analyzing, &quot;Okay, now how do we get into Reality? Because we need the reality-based root system if we&#x27;re going to change it,&quot; you know. So they&#x27;ve been working really hard on doing that for the last couple of days [chuckle].</div>

<div class="line">But I honestly... you know, a lot of these countries don&#x27;t even have power. I mean, you go to some places in America and they&#x27;re like, oh, our system&#x27;s out, the internet&#x27;s out, the power&#x27;s out. We don&#x27;t even have stable internet everywhere in the United States - let alone in Pakistan. There&#x27;s just no... it is not viable in any way to think that you could process X amount of transactions, when almost 80% of the world&#x27;s business is still done in cash - insert currency here. That&#x27;s only, we&#x27;re only at 20% and they can&#x27;t even handle 20%. China ran tests using China Coin or whatever they were going to call it, it doesn&#x27;t matter at this point. And they couldn&#x27;t even process, for their own citizens, for longer than four to five minutes. So I don&#x27;t really see it happening in the near future - I think it&#x27;s a fantasy.</div>

<div class="line">And a lot of times, what I&#x27;m finding is, they do have a - I can&#x27;t... it was USTC and then it was USDX and then it&#x27;s &quot;USD this&quot; and &quot;USD that&quot; - they come up with a different name all the time. And what they have been doing is they&#x27;ve been giving these wallets with this coin to banks (behind the scenes) and to, for example, like BlackRock and that kind of thing, and they&#x27;re telling them they&#x27;re going to give it to them at this value. And they did try to get banks to issue credit lines against it, and they did for a few elite &quot;reasons,&quot; for purposes - but that does not a world financial system make. That makes a little barter system.</div>

<div class="line">Something is worth something... if you say it&#x27;s worth something. So in other words, if we lived in the same town, and we chose to not use U.S. dollars in our town, and we used &quot;Kimbux&quot; - whatever it is - and all the merchants took them, and we had cards that were denominated in Kimbux and all that kind of thing - then as long as we didn&#x27;t leave the town, we&#x27;re great. We try to convince the world that Kimbux is a good idea. You know, now I got to figure out how to distribute it, print the paper, do all the things. If we&#x27;re not going to have hard cash, now I got to figure out how to get every human on the planet a cellphone.</div>

<div class="line">I mean, Trump&#x27;s trying to sell cellphone service at $45. OK, in the States, that&#x27;s kind of the going rate. But what about the other 7 billion, 700 million people out there? Like, where&#x27;s their cellphone? I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re - you know, $45 U.S. is a lot of money in a lot of countries - there&#x27;s no way. There&#x27;s just no way. I can&#x27;t see it. It&#x27;s a fantasy, and I think that they&#x27;re doing it because of their investors. Really I do. You know, they&#x27;ve even had people - and I know this for a fact - from the Secret Service, who have been in the White House having conversations with the dumb operatives in there, trying to tell them they need to turn over - what&#x27;s the other big platform? Coinbase. Yeah. And they&#x27;re like, it&#x27;s not gonna do what you want it to do. It works for this, but it&#x27;s not gonna process all those transactions. There&#x27;s no way it&#x27;s gonna replace the dollar. So. I don&#x27;t see it happening any time in the near future.</div>

I know we&#x27;ve had 300 people, lots of people have questions, but we&#x27;ll do it again next month. So, please come back again next month and you&#x27;ll have an opportunity.</div>

I haven&#x27;t been able to for a couple weeks. Hopefully this week I can, but it&#x27;s just been too busy. But maybe we could consider doing a Question and Answer like that. Where we&#x27;re not actually streaming it live. Maybe we could do it more often if it&#x27;s just a Zoom call, you know, where people could join and we&#x27;re just chatting and asking questions. So maybe we can put something like that together? That way we can answer more questions and we have more time to talk to everyone.</div>

<div class="line">Nat:  That&#x27;s a good idea, Kim. So we don&#x27;t really have to have this formal GIA streaming thing. We can just jump on Zoom together and we might make it last minute even because we don&#x27;t know with Kim&#x27;s schedule when she can do things. So if we can be more flexible, we can definitely do that. So again, I know it&#x27;s disappointing for the people that didn&#x27;t get to ask a question, but we know that. So we&#x27;re going to try and accommodate you in some way. So Kim, great idea.</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim:  Yeah, so if everybody thinks it&#x27;s a good idea, you know, maybe either drop a note in the community or instead of having your hand up, maybe a little heart up or something like that, if that&#x27;s a possibility. That way we can have more of an opportunity to chat. You know, we might not be here on camera or something - you might just catch me on a phone, dialing in or something. But if you want to do that, we can do a little question and answer like that.</div>

<div class="line">Kim:  Well, sometimes maybe, sometimes not, but we wouldn&#x27;t be streaming live. But it would obviously give us more of an opportunity to answer more questions. I might be gardening or something at the same time. You know, sometimes I am with the Field Messengers, or I&#x27;m working in the lab or I&#x27;m doing something else, but it would at least give us more of an opportunity to answer some more questions and have some more interaction. So I think if everybody would like to do that, drop something in the Community Chat, or in the Field Messenger chat or wherever. Send us an email, and we&#x27;ll try to make it happen. You know, at least maybe instead of once a month and so formal, maybe we can do it on the weekend or something when most people aren&#x27;t working - change the times up a bit.</div>

<div class="line">Kim:  OK. Thank you so much for coming, obviously. And thank you so much for your support. I hope that we get to talk more often, because I do love having these chats. It&#x27;s just such a big thing, you know, to put it all together like this. And it takes hours of prep time from the Production Team. And even then, it&#x27;s not always right, and they always want to interrupt us. So I would love to get feedback on times you think that might work. Maybe we have three different times where we do it, maybe a couple times a month instead of just once a month. And, yeah, that way we can have a little question and answer and talk some more.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But I do appreciate all of you. Thank you so much for all of you that try to work as hard as you can to make this all happen too, and keep people grounded - oh, dear, that&#x27;s been a tough one, ask Natalie. And for the last couple of weeks, just keeping people grounded and you&#x27;re going to be the voice of sanity in a crazy world right now. So stay safe.</div>
