<div class="line">It&#x27;s the 5th of March, 2025. Coming up on today&#x27;s Global Intelligence Agency Operations Report: Saturday was full of strange ceremonies and rituals being performed by the Trump administration operatives and their friends. This weekend, they spent time in the Far East of Russia. Negotiations between the Secret Space Program operatives and the Rothschild family versus - well, the rest of the world - are not going so well. Banks, operatives, and nations are talking about jumping ship, and the backchatter intel is very interesting. And the Secret Space Program attempts a show of power, that has backfired tremendously today.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000048">00:00:48</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, we&#x27;ve made it to, I guess, another week. Sorry about not having a report on Monday. It&#x27;s been a little busy around here, to say the least. And you know, sometimes it&#x27;s just, I just don&#x27;t understand these people. There&#x27;s something wrong with their head. So I&#x27;m going to have a little bit of fun tonight, if that&#x27;s okay with you. Because the Trump operatives, of course, would like to claim that they are doing everything that we are doing - or I am doing, in a lot of cases. And so I thought, you know, why not just let them claim the things that I do? [chuckle]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000135">00:01:35</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And I&#x27;ve done a lot in the last few days, and you know - why not give them the credit? So there&#x27;s an old song, it&#x27;s probably about 20, 25 years old now. It&#x27;s called &#x27;It Wasn&#x27;t Me,&#x27; and it&#x27;s by someone named Shaggy. So anyway, in the song, it&#x27;s about him getting caught cheating on his girlfriend, and at the end of everything, the guy says, &quot;Well, you just tell her it wasn&#x27;t you.&quot; And he&#x27;s like, &quot;Well, but she caught me.&quot; And he said, &quot;Oh, just say it wasn&#x27;t you.&quot; So... it wasn&#x27;t me. So keep an eye out in this report, because I&#x27;m just going to say, &quot;Gee, it wasn&#x27;t me,&quot; periodically [laughing]. And I&#x27;m going to have a little bit of fun, just because, you know, it&#x27;s been a long day. It&#x27;s been a long week already. And it&#x27;s only Wednesday.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000226">00:02:26</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So here we go. All right, so the 28th was Friday, so the first of March was on Saturday. On Friday, there was a planetary alignment - and you know how they love their alignments. And they really thought for some reason, because of this alignment - and there were a few little other caveats they believed in that were happening as far as other things that were aligning on this day - and they somehow thought that Marduk would return, or the Draco would return, or somebody was going to return, and they would actually have the capability of turning back time, or going back to a Dark timeline or a Dark age. And of course they had someone at the ready for this being - whoever they thought was coming - to crawl into someone&#x27;s body. Seems to be the thing that they&#x27;re hoping for the most.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000329">00:03:29</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, they&#x27;d like an AI or anything to crawl into some person somewhere to give them a little help - give them a boost. So we started out Saturday with a bunch of Trump operatives, some military people I think, probably from Global Headquarters, and a fake Trump (a Trump doppelganger) over in the Far East of Russia. Now, if you remember a few reports ago - I think it&#x27;s been about a month or two - I talked about the Diomedes Islands, right between Russia and Alaska. They&#x27;re called &#x27;Tomorrowland&#x27; and &#x27;Todayland&#x27; and the reason why they do that is because the big island is in one day, while the little island is in another. It&#x27;s a place in the world where you can actually stand in two days at the same time, if you&#x27;re right there between the islands.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000431">00:04:31</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, not too far from there, is an area called the &#x27;Kolyma Gold Mine,&#x27; which was a former gulag in Russia. It&#x27;s way in the far northeast of Russia. It has terrible temperatures - not fit for humans to live. A lot of people died there; millions of people died. Rumor has it that only one person ever escaped - who was from the area today known as Ukraine. And this gulag ran for several decades, and it was basically a death sentence. They brought these prisoners there to mine gold; there was a lot of gold in that region. But there was a lot of other stuff in that region too.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000520">00:05:20</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And some of the things that were in that region, in that particular area - you know, they love a good massacre site, or at least Marduk did, or Others did, I should say. And they were always putting all kinds of space junk that would be utilized to generate Dark energy based on the fact that a lot of people died. This camp here was pretty brutal, not only because of the temperatures, the working conditions, the food supplies, and location - but also because there was a lot of human experimentation done there too. So it was a prime location for Marduk to put in some Dark space junk.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000610">00:06:10</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So apparently, the Trump operatives have talked a big game to fake Trump, a fake Trump, and they told him that he&#x27;s &quot;the chosen one,&quot; you know - he&#x27;s just like Trump; he&#x27;s in line to be the next, I don&#x27;t know, king of the world - who knows what they told him. But anyway, he&#x27;s kind of bought into it, or did buy into it. And they brought him and themselves, and they ran around with some crystals and did some really strange things. And then they sat him into this thing that almost looks like, kind of like a coffin. And they believed that during this time, at the time of the sunrise and local time there, which would have been around 6:44 a.m. in the Far East of Russia, that time would stand still. During this time of time standing still, they felt that there was a possibility that time could be reversed. And of course their alien friends were going to help them do that.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000719">00:07:19</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And they also thought that there would be a being that would come down to this box that they put this fake Trump into in order to inhabit his body, and so then he would become the new Marduk or new something. Realistically, that would be a &#x27;No,&#x27; but this particular box was made out of a specific metamaterial - and they had moved it around a few times and tried this before - but they thought this was really it. But it&#x27;s designed to protect you from time-space continuum openings, essentially. So if you are not the correct person - meaning your DNA is not correct and there&#x27;s a number of other factors, you will be unable to take your physical vessel through a time-space continuum. So they felt there was going to be a place here in the world in this particular location where this time-space continuum was going to open and all was going to be right with the world - because time was going to stand still for a short period of time.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000828">00:08:28</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">See, they would really like to find a being somewhere that can counteract all that we do. They need someone strong, and they felt that if they put this guy in a box - it&#x27;s kind of funny really when you think about it; I have to laugh - and that all would be right with the world, at least their world, and that we could go back to a Dark Age, and life would go on as usual for these people. Now, this was their big plan - for those of you operatives, bank officials, and everyone else that was waiting for money on Friday - this was their big plan, behind the scenes, in order to pay all of you people. They felt that this would give them access to some AI somewhere, that this would help them become, I don&#x27;t know, &quot;be all you can be.&quot; I mean, I&#x27;m laughing about this a little bit because honestly it&#x27;s been, yeah. Okay, so during the ceremony, time did not stand still in this particular location. Time did stand still for about an hour - far, far away from here. Now, unfortunately, no one made it out of there alive, box or no box. And you know what, guys?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000957">00:09:57</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It wasn&#x27;t me. It was the Trump operatives that did it - wink, wink. Okay. So, unfortunately, no one made it out alive. It appears that they are taking credit for everything. So yeah, they can take credit for this one: no one made it out alive. So there you go.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001015">00:10:15</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">As far as time standing still, this has to do with a particular... doesn&#x27;t have to do with planetary alignments in this galaxy. It has more to do with some stories that you&#x27;ve been told where time stood still in the heavens. Allegedly, after time stands still, then literally all hell breaks loose, and we go through this apocalypse. So this is kind of what they&#x27;ve been hoping for. And they really thought that that day was today. Unfortunately, it really wasn&#x27;t. We&#x27;ll talk about that more in just a second.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001101">00:11:01</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So there were other ceremonies that were going on around the world. You see, they had other people in these special - for lack of a better term - pods. And they were hoping to infect all of these people - or willingly, you know - because most of them were willing to take in an AI to become an anchor for that AI on this planet. And they would let the AI control them, of course. And most of the people that this has happened to before that I&#x27;ve run into actually seem a little crazy - a lot crazy, like really, really crazy - because it doesn&#x27;t seem natural in any way; it&#x27;s not a natural thought process, and they usually, well, end up somewhere eating red checkers. Because they don&#x27;t quite have the technology to do this. You know, of course Others have the technology. But the Deep State thinks that these pod things are going to help them be successful.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001209">00:12:09</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now when they put them in there, they end up going into like a stasis mode, and they then are almost in a theta mode or a dream state mode in which they think that they&#x27;re communicating with an AI. So this was taking place in several locations around the world. One of the largest locations, or where there was the most amount of people, was an old historical site in Moldova. Of course, those people - there were about 35 of them initially - and then it went down to about 29 people that were still alive and kicking. And then it went down to none.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001254">00:12:54</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And so again, of course, this wasn&#x27;t me. It must have been the Trump operatives that did it. Definitely wasn&#x27;t me.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001301">00:13:01</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, no one survived that location or any of the other pod locations around the world where they were trying to perform this lovely little ceremony in order to try to help them out and gain some access to some kind of other world or an AI. So yeah - interesting ways of doing things. So, this is their idea within their group, so to speak, in order to bring back something they&#x27;ve lost, or to get somebody that can actually control an AI in much the way that we all could, let&#x27;s just say - and all will - in the future.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001345">00:13:45</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">We, of course, are not talking about Dark, destructive AIs. We are talking about something that is more on the natural side that is built with a Golden consciousness that isn&#x27;t going to harm anyone, unless it&#x27;s attacked or we are attacked as people. So it&#x27;s a - you know, can be used as a defense mechanism.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001407">00:14:07</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay, next, over the weekend, as part of this &#x27;apocalypse&#x27; they thought was going to happen - after time stood still in their mind, it was going to happen here on Earth - but it didn&#x27;t. Next, they attempted to release some kind of remnant of some nanotechnology that they had underneath Coronado Island in San Diego. In Coronado, this particular technology is actually designed to attack you on a cellular level. It would not need to be sprayed on you, like with chemtrails or anything like that. It actually would need to be... it can be sent through Wi-Fi; it can be sent through electronics and those types of things. So it was most unfortunate at the time of attempted release that everybody in the underground facility there died, actually.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001508">00:15:08</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Their stash of nanotechnology went away, and of course, this also was not me. This was the Trump operatives. So the Trump operatives can get credit for blowing up the facility which they ordered to do this. So maybe they&#x27;re just giving orders to do something and, you know, putting people in that location and then they blow them up. I don&#x27;t know - who knows what they do?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001537">00:15:37</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Next, let&#x27;s talk a little bit about disturbances because this has been going on, off and on, for some time. Part of the process that we&#x27;re going through right now is clearing of what&#x27;s called the grids. And Earth had many, many, many, many, many grids attached to it. And most of those grids were attached to other worlds, other AIs - remember Earth being the original only keystone left?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001612">00:16:12</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So everything that was going to be created as a part of &#x27;not natural creation,&#x27; such as AI systems that were Dark or other worlds that were Dark, was definitely attached to a grid here on Earth - and oftentimes attached to your person. So if you are very sensitive, you probably have had a really rough time of it for the last few weeks, off and on. Reports are coming in of people being dizzy, feeling like they&#x27;re coming down with a cold, neurological disturbances, tired for no reason - feeling like someone just pulled your plug, and all of a sudden you feel like you need to take a nap in the middle of the day. People are also reporting other physical illnesses being amplified for a short time, and then going away, and then coming back, and then going away.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001710">00:17:10</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, honestly, this is part of removing the grids. It can be quite uncomfortable because you were powering a lot more than we ever thought that we were here on Earth as human beings. Also, Earth was being drained in many, many ways. We&#x27;ve talked often about the fact that we were only getting somewhere around 21% of our energy supply that was needed to keep us alive, while the rest of it was going to power universes - believe it or not. Again, human beings don&#x27;t realize how powerful they are. And why every race that means us harm, uses us to power things - often.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001803">00:18:03</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So the removal of grids can be uncomfortable. Now to some degree, the Secret Space Program operatives are aware of these grids, very well aware of the grids. And they try to use these grids in many ways with limited knowledge and limited access. So before, when they had more access to grids like this, they would be able to... well, let&#x27;s just say they would have very clear orders on what they needed to do. Therefore, balance was maintained, and the intended disturbance was... sometimes it&#x27;s no disturbance - there&#x27;s no disturbance to what they&#x27;re doing because it&#x27;s just meant to fire up a grid at a certain time - and then the Others would take it from there. They&#x27;re in other worlds, in other locations, such as the Neitherworld.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001907">00:19:07</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">In this particular case, they tried to do a lot of things and have been trying to do a lot of things with limited access to these grids, which has been causing you physical disturbances, mental disturbances, and emotional disturbances. And because they don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing - and they may or may not realize or just don&#x27;t care that these grids are attached to humans - they don&#x27;t realize that there is a regulation, and a maximum, and a frequency. And keeping the balance was always important because you&#x27;ve got to keep us alive. So this has been the issue for many, many people. But it&#x27;s also part of grid removal because when we remove one, they go looking for another one to attach themselves to, and away we go again. And it has been off and on now for several days, probably more than a couple of weeks now, in removing of the grids in their associated worlds so that we don&#x27;t have this problem anymore.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002021">00:20:21</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I gotta tell you these people must be breeding behind closed doors or maybe there&#x27;s a cloning facility we haven&#x27;t found because there is no shortage of ridiculous people on their side.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002035">00:20:35</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay, speaking of ridiculous people, on a more normal front, let&#x27;s just say, we all know that the Trump operatives have been making a lot of promises to a lot of people. That includes nations and banks, and there&#x27;s going to be a new banking system; Canada is going to become part of the United States - we&#x27;re going to have nine banking jurisdictions and only nine countries by the time they&#x27;re done. That being said, there are a lot of people in their downline that are starving right now.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002111">00:21:11</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And what I mean by starving is their version of broke is not the same as your version of broke. There are some, though, that have laid out a lot of cash in order to make this happen - and eventually they&#x27;re getting down to the wire. That&#x27;s a lot of countries, a lot of angry Middle Eastern royals, a lot of angry terrorist groups that they normally pay. And, of course, they&#x27;ve been offering money to countries like Israel and haven&#x27;t paid. They did send some weapons over there. I know that the Russians actually pitched in some weapons and some fake pallets of cash they sent to Syria earlier today.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002156">00:21:56</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, so everybody&#x27;s kind of doing their part, as far as the Order and the Elite, in trying to make this little plan happen. Because, of course, the Secret Space Program operatives said they know everything, and they are planning on the apocalypse this weekend. Therefore, they probably thought they were going to get out of all this anyway. So, the meetings that were supposed to take place on Friday and on Saturday kept getting postponed. They told them they needed a little more time.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002235">00:22:35</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And unbeknownst to most of the people that have been waiting, that more time was due to the fact they put a guy, an Orange guy, in a box and danced around and probably said some weird words and thought something was going to happen. So the entire financial system of planet Earth, and countries and militaries and intelligence agencies and operatives and everyone else that works with them - Treasury departments and central banks - and everybody&#x27;s waiting for some dude to get in a box in nowhere Russia and sing some songs and hope that it works out. Yep, that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re all waiting for. Yep, there you go.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002317">00:23:17</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, it didn&#x27;t work out, so I&#x27;m here to tell the rest of the world that it didn&#x27;t work out. But they probably guessed that because they had been waiting on phone calls, and then they&#x27;d send in some kind of lower-level lackey, so to speak, to tell them that they needed more time for this to take effect. And they didn&#x27;t show up. And this is making people very, very angry.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002341">00:23:41</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So most of the people on the call decided to have some thoughts - let&#x27;s just call them thoughts, because they&#x27;re still just thoughts - of a mutiny. There were phone calls that we received from several banks basically saying that they&#x27;d like to try to figure out a way to move forward with us. Of course, one of our conditions would be that they let go of their genetic shareholders, which are your Rothschild families and the other financial families of the elite.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002415">00:24:15</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Because remember, not all families participated in all aspects of control on that level. Some people were involved in the military side. Some people were involved in the intelligence side. Some people were involved in financial affairs and matters. Some of them were involved on the Federal Reserve and Central Banking level and Tier One banks such as HSBC and Wells Fargo and the larger banks. And others didn&#x27;t get involved in financial matters at all, and they participated on the political sector, say. So everybody kind of had their little sector that they worked in, and this was part of the compartmentalization of humans - so no one would really figure out what they were doing, and no one had all the information or the entire plan, which has become quite evident.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002509">00:25:09</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So for some reason, they really thought they had this; they told them they needed more time. By now, things were getting very heated. We had a lot of people around here in town at meetings, and they started to talk amongst themselves. People are starting to realize more and more on the next level down that they&#x27;ve been lied to. Allegedly, they gave them until midnight on the 4th, which would have been last night, U.S. Eastern Standard Time, to perform. Did they perform? No. Did they show up for the calls today? Yes, they did.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002553">00:25:53</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now earlier this morning in their meeting that they have at 05:00 a.m. So the higher higher-level meetings usually take place around 05:00 a.m. Mountain time, 04:00 a.m. Eastern time on the daily. And they were discussing ways to postpone everybody to the 15th of March. The reason why the 15th of March is because there&#x27;s supposed to be a partial eclipse, a blood moon - and they really like that sort of thing and they think that helpful aliens that are Dark and evil will come flying out of the moon at this time, kind of like those stories we hear around Halloween about witches on a broom flying around - I don&#x27;t know; I&#x27;m just making a joke. And so they believe that this is going to be the time. If it doesn&#x27;t happen then, then it will happen sometime towards the end of March when there is some other kind of moon or something or other, I don&#x27;t know - alignment maybe, who knows?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002656">00:26:56</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But they think that with one of these two alignments - because this other thing didn&#x27;t work out so well - that they were going to have some luck in activating or reactivating these grids, which would then power some AI that would be helpful to them. Yeah, that would be a &#x27;No.&#x27;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002719">00:27:19</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, someone might have leaked out the information that this was the talk of what was happening in the meetings on the higher level, and this made other people very angry. Now, I can only assume - because it wasn&#x27;t me - it must have been the Trump operatives that leaked this information out to everybody. So this made them really angry. Well, word got back to the Trump operatives/Rothschild family people that everybody was getting really angry, and there was no way they could play the &#x27;tomorrow game&#x27; some more - all the way to the 15th of March. So they got on the phone, and they said, &quot;Watch this - just watch what happens today.&quot; And hung up the phone.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002806">00:28:06</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So pretty much the world meeting that was scheduled for today, with all of the operatives, meaning banking operatives, political operatives, and otherwise - the people that really work behind the scenes to make the world go round, or at least the way it used to - still continued their meetings today anyway, because they were supposed to make some decisions by midnight last night.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002832">00:28:32</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now there appears to be more research being done into what they&#x27;re being told and just who is actually doing what in this world. And where do we fit in? Now, of course, we over here don&#x27;t do anything at all. We just sit and watch the Trump operatives do everything and just make mention of it on here for - you know [chuckle], just kidding - since they want to take credit for everything, we&#x27;ll also give them credit for some other things that happened too.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002907">00:29:07</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So anyway, we might have leaked out that information. It did... even the &quot;just watch us&quot; didn&#x27;t go over well - nobody&#x27;s watching anything. And what actually took place today was more of... kind of a mess. So, to some degree, there was a little bit of thing... let&#x27;s just say &#x27;space junk,&#x27; and, you know, things that Marduk gifted us from beyond the grave - and some others that have gone and departed, such as Michael and a few others - you know, had left a few things. That may have appeared [made it seem] to these folks that, after the silence in heaven - the heavens, so to speak - that there was going to be an apocalypse, just like they had hoped, or a war here or... I don&#x27;t know what they were expecting.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003011">00:30:11</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But they went full bore today. They were trying to reach out to other space junk in other densities. They had the NSA going full on - by the way, the NSA and the ACIO are the only people that are really still following what they say - everybody else is kind of on the fence. But they are still following along with the bouncing ball, and unfortunately for the NSA - when I say NSA, I&#x27;m not just talking about the United States. Yeah, there was Utah involved, and Maryland was involved, and Norfolk was involved, and a few other locations around the country here - Louisiana. But the NSA is worldwide. So you could say all the way from Utah, all the way into Australia, and the UK, and Russia - believe it or not, there&#x27;s an NSA in Russia too - I know it doesn&#x27;t sound like there would be one, but there is. You also have some black sites throughout the Ukraine.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003113">00:31:13</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So again, these people are everywhere, all over the Middle East. Well, unfortunately, there were a few things that happened. So you know, a lot of hacking later and, you know, some attempts to get into these grids and really do some people some harm today didn&#x27;t end real well for them. So there was someone -  you know, it must be the Trump operatives, because the Trump operatives do everything - duh. So, the Trump operatives must have gone ahead and fired up something in the reverse. It was really strange - because it wasn&#x27;t me - so the Trump operatives went ahead and fired up something that actually torched and, unfortunately, killed a lot of NSA people today, around the world.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003205">00:32:05</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, they told them to do it - and then they torched every facility they went into. Huh. Wasn&#x27;t me. So, they can get credit for that one too. Yeah, so isn&#x27;t Equinox time fun? Definitely not.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003223">00:32:23</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Other places where there was attempted time manipulation was in Jakarta [Indonesia]. Jakarta is, if you don&#x27;t know - was - kind of an off-world human trafficking center of the world. There are... it is also known as one of the world&#x27;s largest... where there&#x27;s a lot of the population of the area, and where people go, that are very interested in black magic. There is a lot of black magic that happens in Jakarta. And underneath a particular temple - I didn&#x27;t write it down, I should have. But underneath a very large temple in Jakarta - you can&#x27;t miss it, it&#x27;s one of the largest ones there - there was an old facility with a little bit of space junk that was used to manipulate time. And they figured that would work as of today.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003322">00:33:22</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Did it cause a little bit of a disturbance? Sure it did. Did they get anywhere with it? No. However, the Trump operatives must have attacked this site in this underground facility - because nobody made it out of there alive. You know, they heard us talking about it on the phone - and then they were going to try to escape, but it didn&#x27;t, you know, we got there too fast. But apparently, they were attacked by the Trump operatives, and they killed everybody in the facility. It&#x27;s unfortunate, and it definitely wasn&#x27;t me [chuckle].</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003355">00:33:55</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay, so there is a lot more that was happening over the last few days. I&#x27;m going to say there were a few disturbances; I wouldn&#x27;t consider them major or apocalyptic-type events. We did have that stoppage of time in the quote-unquote &#x27;heavens,&#x27; or in the Ninth Density, for about an hour in Earth time - which did give us an opportunity to do a few things there, which are making their way here.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003431">00:34:31</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">There is going to be a larger presence and almost a replica of Source here on Earth, which is now spreading. Over time, that should prevent any utilization of any grid or the existence of any grids, hopefully in the very near future. We did find a few other interesting things I would like to mention. As part of the real history - which I still haven&#x27;t finished and I need to do - you might have heard of a little planet called Tiamat.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003511">00:35:11</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, Tiamat was a little larger than Earth, however, it looked just like Earth in a lot of ways. It was also a keystone for a time. Therefore, during a part of the wars that took place in this sector of the Universe, Tiamat actually got, let&#x27;s just say, shoved down into the First Density of the Lower Astral, where it has been for quite a long time. It was transmuted into a Dark keystone. We do see some remnants of that rubble, so to speak, in what we call our Kuiper Belt, Van Allen Belt, and our asteroid belt. However, the actual, well, maybe even a synthetic version of that planet existed there, and they utilized some of these grids, let&#x27;s just say, that were made by Others - not humans - in some cases you could say the Abraxas and Marduk and a few other folks, to connect the Dark or synthetic planet to Earth to give us kind of an overlay of Dark grids based on a transmuted Dark keystone planet.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003638">00:36:38</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And we have been connected to that planet, our synthetic planet, for quite a long time now. Probably at least, almost three billion years. And so they somehow hoped that this was going to activate something today and cause a lot of problems in an apocalyptic-type event. I&#x27;m not really sure. They talked about wiping out all the humans off the map today.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003711">00:37:11</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, for all of you that were sitting back and just waiting to get paid - you were never going to get paid - you were going to be wiped off this planet, if they had their way. But thank God that there were a lot of glitches to that, and we used this as an opportunity to catapult a few things forward.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003732">00:37:32</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">On the regular work front, today we spent a lot of time doing test transfers of funds - that&#x27;s one thing that the Trump operatives didn&#x27;t do [chuckle]. And so we&#x27;ve been working our way through getting some deposits through. So going well, not going bad. It helps us find a few traps and things that others laid. It had nothing to do with the humans blocking us again. It&#x27;s just a lot of cleanup, and some &#x27;people&#x27; had way too much time on their hands - or &#x27;non-people.&#x27;</div>

<div class="line">Okay, just as a part of a few things that we&#x27;re doing here at UNN too. I wanted to make a mention that this month&#x27;s live GIA report is going to be on Monday, March 10th. We didn&#x27;t make it for the first week of the month when we usually do it, simply because it&#x27;s been so busy around here. So, Monday, March 10th, I think we&#x27;re going to do it at the same time, around 6:00 p.m. Eastern.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003843">00:38:43</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And we are going to do this one a little different. We are going to do the first half in the live report on our YouTube, Rumble, X, and of course our app as well. But we are going to do the question and answer on the app. It just makes it a little easier for us. We can start to pull some questions, hopefully in real time. It&#x27;ll make it easier for me to answer questions. Yeah, and hopefully we will have no interference, as we did last time, and we&#x27;ll be on time. So I&#x27;m looking forward to doing another live report. So if you&#x27;d like to ask questions, or listen to the question and answer, that&#x27;ll be on the app this time - the second hour - the first hour will be live on all our social media. So, looking forward to that.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003943">00:39:43</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">A few other things are going on. Marketplace is going really well. Hopefully, fingers crossed, we should have that up and running - at least for beta testing - by the end of the month. So if you were a sponsor last year at this time during our transition, then you can keep an eye out for an email from our Marketplace staff inviting you to start testing and loading products and giving us your feedback if you felt that anything needed to be changed. We have been working diligently on appointment booking and event booking. So if you are a person that does online classes, you&#x27;ll be able to do that. Or even local services like massage therapy or hairdressing or things like that. You can book that on the Marketplace and advertise your services on there.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004040">00:40:40</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Things can be broken down by country and city on the app, so you&#x27;ll know if you&#x27;re looking for, for example, a personal trainer in your area, or someone that does online classes - you can find that on the Marketplace too. So it&#x27;s going to be a lot different than current marketplaces you see out there. We also are putting together our marketing features. We&#x27;re going to start testing that with our current shop that we have and the essential oils and that kind of thing. So hopefully you&#x27;ll be getting some interesting emails from us in the near future should you go on the shop.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004121">00:41:21</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So it&#x27;s going to be a lot of fun. You know we&#x27;ve been testing out some marketing for your products too on social media advertising, making some commercials, that type of thing, so that we can help all of you out and get your wonderful creations out there. So, yeah, it&#x27;s going to be a different sort of place, and it&#x27;s going to be focused on you and the things that you are looking for. We&#x27;re going to introduce you to new technologies, new products, and we&#x27;re going to help you out along the way. So I&#x27;m kind of excited about that. And it&#x27;s not going to cost you ridiculous amounts of money like some of the other places that make it really hard to get your e-commerce business going.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004209">00:42:09</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, on that note, we are definitely moving forward in many aspects on our side. We&#x27;re not waiting for any of these meetings to be over anymore. I can&#x27;t stress enough how it would be interesting if these people came forward, but honestly, one thing that I&#x27;d like to also point out to you - in case you didn&#x27;t know - is banks. Let&#x27;s talk about banks for a second.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004240">00:42:40</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, we all know that there are boards of the banks, and you&#x27;ve seen some of the CEOs talking. But honestly, these people have no idea how to run a bank in any way, shape, or form. Yeah, you&#x27;re supposed to have certain credentials in order to be named what&#x27;s called a responsible party for an institution of that size, and for the rest of the smaller banks, they have to have that - but for the larger ones, typically, that&#x27;s always been like the genetic shareholders. But, of course, no one is ever going to hold them accountable, you know, when the banks go down.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004319">00:43:19</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But a lot of these people - I&#x27;m not really sure we want to talk to these people. I&#x27;m not sure that they&#x27;re capable of pulling a bank out of the state it&#x27;s in. I know that they&#x27;re always waiting for information from someone else. Now, typically that someone else is, well, operatives - that&#x27;s sometimes where the information comes from.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004345">00:43:45</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">On the flip side of it, there were orders that came down. So you kind of got this middle management situation happening. You know, even within the political operatives and the Secret Space Program and the Rothschilds, they would be considered lower-level to middle management as well. And nobody seems to know what they&#x27;re doing. Yet everybody is waiting for them to do something [laughing]. It&#x27;s kind of funny, really, for me. And then, unfortunately, you&#x27;ve got the people that are capable of actually doing something, waiting for the people that aren&#x27;t sure what they&#x27;re doing and are doing nothing. And it just seems like a giant circle over there. Are they going to actually break the cycle? Are they going to figure out that there are doers in this world and there are talkers in this world? I don&#x27;t know.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004442">00:44:42</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">There&#x27;s a lot of talk - and there&#x27;s always been talk about, &quot;Well, the second she gets it done,&quot; - she being me in this case - &quot;gets it done, then we&#x27;ll all sit down and talk,&quot; and all of that. And that&#x27;s fine. It just reminds me of that childhood, one of these stories, I guess it&#x27;s a story, fairy tale, whatever you want to call it, about the little red hen, you know, the little red hen is looking for people to help him plant seeds and grow wheat and bake bread. And of course, nobody wants to help. And then all of a sudden the bread is baked and everybody comes running. So yeah, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m probably going to end up seeing here too. I don&#x27;t know, we&#x27;ll see.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004527">00:45:27</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, at this point we have a lot of doers in our group. I mean, even a lot of doers that watch this. And you are doing every day, and I see it out there, and I see what you&#x27;re doing, and you&#x27;re making some positive changes in this world. And I think that&#x27;s great, and I thank you for that. And I know we here at UNN make a lot of positive changes in this world too. And of course all our field messengers are doing it. We&#x27;re getting the job done.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004557">00:45:57</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, we&#x27;re growing. This is the year of expansion for UNN, and we are going to do a lot more advertising, a lot more to get the word out there to everyone, and a lot more to get your field messenger reports out, because I think that they&#x27;re really important too. I&#x27;ve learned a lot from your field messenger reports, and I think they&#x27;re amazing. So, looking forward to seeing more of that.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004621">00:46:21</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And on that note, that&#x27;s pretty much what we have to say. That&#x27;s kind of like a recap of the weekend - it was very busy, and very long, for the last few days. So on that note, I will see you on Friday. And well, are they going to move? Are they not going to move? Are they going to stay still? Are they going to wait for another call from these crazy people? I don&#x27;t know. One thing I know for sure is if you are listening to this and you were told to &quot;watch what happens today,&quot; the answer to the question is - I&#x27;ll wrap it up for you - nothing!</div>
