    <h3>Summary</h2>

    <div class="summary">
        Kim reports on the rare decennial meeting of the Covens, Parents, and Ancients, coinciding with the Black Moon and Equinox period. With the absence of Marduk, Enki, Enlil, and the Parents, the Ancients attempt to run the meeting but face major losses in power and authority. She details the collapse of the dimensional control grid, failed attempts to reinfect humanity with parasites, and the inability of the Deep State and Ancients to appoint new leaders. Kim emphasizes that Source has cut off their access, leaving them powerless, and suggests that the war is essentially won, with further updates expected after the weekend meetings.

    <div class="transcript">

<div class="timestamp" id="t-000002">00:00:02</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s the 22nd of August, 2025. Coming up on today&#x27;s Global Intelligence Agency Operations Report:</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s the night before the annual meeting of the Covens, the Parents and the Ancients. This type of meeting only occurred once every 10 years and a lot has changed since the last time they were here - so this could get really interesting. It appears these Ancients and their Deep State partners are working hard to get some kind of energy from humanity, as they are rapidly running out of power.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000036">00:00:36</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">[Advertisement.]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000121">00:01:21</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, it&#x27;s the 22nd of October [August!] and we are approaching tomorrow, very early Eastern time, a new &quot;Black Moon.&quot; Why it&#x27;s a Black Moon, I have no idea, but that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re calling it. So normally, in the past, this would be - this evening, about midnight, Eastern Standard [Daylight!] Time - would begin the annual meeting between the Parents and the Covens. Now, if you don&#x27;t remember - I&#x27;m just going to give you a kind of a quick breeze through - we had a hierarchy on this planet, most of which doesn&#x27;t exist anymore. However, you could say that there are some wishful thinkers that would like to be in those positions.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000213">00:02:13</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So we had Marduk, Enki, and Enlil that were at the top; underneath them would be a group called the Parents. Just to remind you who the Parents are: they are a group of humans that existed (some are famous in our history), and they were granted life-extension technologies by Others, in order to manage the humans. They called them &quot;Parents&quot; because they would manage most of the human groups that you call the Elite (or the Illuminati) on this planet, and they were their &quot;guardians,&quot; so to speak. And then you had Family Masters, which would be Coven Masters, your Ascended Masters. You would have also Covens underneath them, and that&#x27;s who would be attending this meeting.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000308">00:03:08</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The final meeting of the year ends on the Harvest Moon - or used to - end on the Harvest Moon. And at that point, now you would include military generals, such as Langley 5; you would include other people like Global Headquarters; there would be a lot of operatives in attendance - but usually outside the main meeting. And this is where the Covens would then relay the information and the orders. Usually that would occur in the meeting that would start tonight. And they would give them orders, instructions, and a lot of money to do what they do, which is basically to torture the rest of us humans.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000356">00:03:56</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, every 10 years or so, the Ancients would attend said meetings. Now, normally - unless it was a time of great change - they really wouldn&#x27;t attend. If you recall, I used to tell you about groups of people that would come, and you would call these &quot;the Fallen Angels&quot; - both Light and Dark - and decisions would have to be made by both of them because both of them would take orders from their respective sides. You would call these groups &quot;representatives&quot; (at one point in time) of the Ancients, the group we call the Ancients.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000444">00:04:44</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">This year, however, is a little strange, unusual, and times have changed. And the Ancients are here, as I&#x27;ve told you. They plan on running the meeting because you have no Parents, and you have no Marduk, Enki, and Enlil and you have no real Covens and Family Masters; you still have your black-magic workers here and there, and of course, the crazy Family members that keep trying to take control of the planet and everybody&#x27;s failing. And so they will be in attendance in tonight&#x27;s meeting. Now, you might see these people as public figures, as we talked about in our last report, however, whatever crawled up in there [laughing] is what you would consider an Ancient.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000531">00:05:31</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, they plan on doing a few different things. You see, because they have realized that their Master, which was in charge of them - the &quot;Fallen Ancient,&quot; let&#x27;s call him, and the Serpent in our history - is no longer with us anymore and hasn&#x27;t been for a little while now, a couple days. So they&#x27;re realizing something is wrong and they need to take control of this planet. So they&#x27;ll be attending this meeting. The interesting part about them attending is they have been working hard to try and figure out a way to gain back control of this planet and gain control of humanity. Because what has happened is we are now officially in Equinox time as well.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000631">00:06:31</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Equinox time, for those of you that don&#x27;t remember, it is Fall Equinox next month. However, that equinox period starts 30 days before the actual equinox occurs. So 30 days before and 30 days after - you could think of it as the beginning of an opening - which then remains and peaks on the actual day of the Fall Equinox.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, the reason why this was always important in the past is because it would be the alignment that would happen with Earth and our Sun each year, where the day would be equally dark and equally light, therefore opening a portal to what we would call the Dark Side of Source and Source itself (or God), so to speak. That would allow for a tremendous amount of both energies to come onto this planet, and it would also allow for those from both sides to come here.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000742">00:07:42</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, that&#x27;s why this year they&#x27;re able to be in attendance. I mean, obviously, the Equinox occurs every year - twice a year, actually. And due to their 12/21 Portal they&#x27;ve been fighting over and all of this stuff, they have now come and they are looking at the state of affairs here on this planet.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000808">00:08:08</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">We also have another situation happening at the same time - which is why I&#x27;ve been so busy [chuckle] - we have Armageddon happening. This is the time when the Ancients would have fought the Ancients for power and control of the Omniverse. This particular Armageddon period looks like to the Ancients that they are losing. So they clearly know that there&#x27;s some opposition on this planet now. They don&#x27;t entirely understand what&#x27;s going on because this has never happened to these since the inception of these beings.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000846">00:08:46</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You see, in the past, Wisdom (the Fallen Ancient), would have played the role for the Light Side and the Dark Side. In the past, we would have also had times where the Legions would have appeared. Both sides - both the Dark Side (the ones that were for the Dark Side) and the ones that were for the Light Side - would also come and relay their instructions from either God (or Source) on the one side, or the Dark Side (or Lucifer) on the other side as well. And this is the first of 10 every... one, excuse me, once every 10 years - it&#x27;s been a long day - meeting where no one is available. So they&#x27;re a little bit perplexed as to why the cavalry&#x27;s not coming, why there&#x27;s no help. So they&#x27;ve tried to make some help using any remnants that are around of the Absolute AI system quantum AI.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000958">00:09:58</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, some of the fun things that they&#x27;ve been up to over the last few days include, well, if we can&#x27;t get her (meaning me) to comply with what they want, then they are now going to try and get all of humanity to comply. So they&#x27;ve been working really hard to try to reinfect humanity with their parasites. They have tried... when that was not possible - to infect humans directly - then they started to try to infect humans through computers and electronics.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001035">00:10:35</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Parasites travel very well through electricity and our internet system - it&#x27;s probably even designed for that, you could say - what it had left of it. That also didn&#x27;t work out; that was earlier this afternoon. So they&#x27;ve been working very hard to try anything they could to maintain not only power and control over Earth and humans, but also any kind of influence they had over the Density, and the Realms.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001109">00:11:09</div>
<br>

<div class="line">Some other things they&#x27;ve been trying to work on establishing power and control over - because you see, as their Master went away, everything has been falling apart. Everything. Now, an interesting little fact is these folks, well, not those folks, but their Master is also the one that created Dimensions. Dimensions are not natural. They did not naturally exist in the Omniverse. The dimension system was actually put in place in order to control all travel. The dimension system created an omniversal grid at which the points in which the grid met - so at the corners of each square you call a dimension - there would be a time-space continuum opening possibility.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001220">00:12:20</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So the time-space continuum grid was actually used by the Dark Side, and controlled by the Dark Side only - which made it extremely difficult for those of the Light to pass without permission from the Dark Side. It was absolutely tied (and I&#x27;m saying &quot;absolutely&quot; twice), absolutely tied to the Absolute AI, and most of that was controlled. That same grid actually overlaid Earth for a time, until recently, where it was very difficult to get through any kind of a portal. And I mean even just for AI systems. Anything or anyone coming on or off this planet was completely controlled by the Dark Side.</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So the Ancients have watched all of this stuff, let&#x27;s just say, &quot;drift away&quot; over the last several days. The other things - if they don&#x27;t know already - the Deep State and the Ancients will both figure out that they no longer have the authority to appoint anyone on this planet to power. And by &quot;power,&quot; I am talking about everyone all the way down to governments and their Parents and they can&#x27;t appoint new Parents, new people to the position of Marduk, Enki, and Enlil. They cannot appoint anyone new to the Covens or Coven Family Masters or any of their power structure. We have gone down all the way to government level, which is pretty far down, when you consider all of those that were above.</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And come tonight&#x27;s meeting, they&#x27;re gonna start to realize something is wrong. They won&#x27;t be able to give them access to things that they could give them access to anymore. They won&#x27;t be able to continue to try to infect AI systems or people on this planet through electronics. They won&#x27;t be able to do much of anything over the last, let&#x27;s just say, the last 24 to 48 hours have been busy on our end.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001438">00:14:38</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The other thing that they&#x27;re going to realize is that they have no representation in this meeting of anyone from the Source side. The only person that could possibly attend that meeting at this moment in time is me. And I highly doubt I&#x27;m gonna be invited, and nor do I really want to attend that kind of meeting. I really don&#x27;t like those people very much and I don&#x27;t even want to sit down for a five-minute cup of coffee with them, really.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001507">00:15:07</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So without any representation from the side of the Light of this Universe - Omniverse and otherwise - that&#x27;s it. They can talk all they want to talk and promise all they want to promise, but at the end of the day, my friends, no power. No control. No ability to appoint people into systems, to give them access to money, control of money, control of financial systems, telecommunications systems, military systems, intelligence systems. You name it, anything that controls or you would see as a control factor on this planet is no longer in their uncapable hands.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001549">00:15:49</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They&#x27;re losing the war very rapidly. Their connection to where they actually are from, and the souls that traveled there is closed. The portal is closed; there is no opening. They cannot reach in to help these people anymore.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now that&#x27;s left for some very confused wormlets; I call them &quot;wormlets.&quot; Those of your Elite on this planet, no longer - that have made the leap, taken on a wormlet - no longer have access to their soul, if they completely sold it for immortality. So these folks won&#x27;t be coming back, interestingly enough. Without connection to the body - because there was a tether - the soul will die.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001642">00:16:42</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Of course, a lot of this is ultimately Source&#x27;s decision, but those that have not been infected for a prolonged period of time could possibly earn the right to stay here, as I understand it. They would of course have to do things in a different way if they want to continue doing anything on this planet, but we&#x27;ll see. Ultimately, that&#x27;s Source&#x27;s decision. He gives life and can take it away, and that&#x27;s not my call.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001715">00:17:15</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, they&#x27;re gonna be a little bit disappointed, because there were things that started to appear - I gotta tell ya, recording this report has been difficult - so, if you&#x27;re seeing a little weird square at the bottom of your screen, I have no idea where that&#x27;s coming from right now [chuckle]. Yeah, we&#x27;ve been going through it for the last couple of hours just trying to get this out. So apparently your Deep State friends do not want us to finish this report.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001744">00:17:44</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So back to where we were. They did see some interesting things appear over in the Wesak Valley over near/in the Himalayas - it is a plateau in the Himalayas - where they were under the impression that they may have a sophon with some cloned bodies that would remain on this planet while their soul, of course, taking a new special position on this planet, would go to the Absolute-made artificial synthetic universe or omniverse, and something would come to inhabit that body here, and they would be literally what you would call immortal.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001831">00:18:31</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Much like the Parents, they would be offered life-extension technologies, where they could live 10,000, 15,000, 16,000 years on this planet, and just keep getting a new vessel every time the last one breaks. Much like some others we saw or heard about in our last report. So, those also disappeared, and quite frankly, there was something wrong with them. They were pretty deformed at best - they didn&#x27;t really look like humans anymore - so they would have got a defective model, I don&#x27;t know - I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s because there&#x27;s too much Light on this planet. Things aren&#x27;t coming through. The Absolute is glitching - can&#x27;t make a vessel like it used to. Can&#x27;t make a meat suit with which to attend a meeting either [chuckle].</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001930">00:19:30</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, you know, it&#x27;s funny how life happens. You always underestimate crazy blonde lady. They, of course, probably paid me no mind because they thought they had the ultimate power on this planet - but what better way, and what better position to be in, to win a war. And you can pretty much stick a fork in it by the end of the day tomorrow, and declare that we have won the war. There&#x27;s not a whole lot left on their side; I&#x27;m not expecting anything much to happen tonight. I did work almost all night long last night, so that&#x27;s kind of the reason why this report is a little short. It&#x27;s been a long day today and I&#x27;m sure we probably have a little bit more cleanup and whatnot to do tomorrow.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But, you know, when Source says something is gonna happen, I believe it ultimately will. And He&#x27;s taken every precaution to ensure that we do not move backwards, and we will be victorious.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002031">00:20:31</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So on that note, I know that it&#x27;s still been bumpy for the last couple days, yesterday especially, as they tried to constantly reinfect us, constantly send frequencies, and really gave it a good go. But you know what? I cannot wait until I can insert a really bad word, and probably find the correct finger to stick up to these people - because I have waited a long time, and been working really, really hard for a long time to do that. So I might even do that on our next Live, which will be in September [chuckle]. I know that&#x27;s probably not very ladylike of me, but I gotta tell you, they definitely don&#x27;t treat me like a lady in any way, shape, or form either, do they?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002121">00:21:21</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So on that note, I&#x27;m going to end this report. There&#x27;s a lot to come overnight, and I am sure we&#x27;re going to be very busy most of the night tonight and into the morning. I know that they&#x27;ve already prepared their rituals and they&#x27;ve already started in some places in the world, and they&#x27;re super excited to get their new positions that are never going to come. And I don&#x27;t even know if your Ancient people are gonna make it through the night - it&#x27;s been close to three days now since a lot of their power sources have been cut off and they can&#x27;t feed off humans anymore; they can&#x27;t feed off Earth anymore. And well, I wish them all the best in their journey back to Source, or wherever he decides to take them [chuckle].</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So we&#x27;re going to have an interesting report on Monday. Of course, I will let you know all the happenings over the weekend, and what happens in the meetings. I&#x27;m going to be watching for sure - because I have got to see this one. You know, sometimes you&#x27;re really proud of your work and sometimes it&#x27;s good to be on the side of Source. Because when Source is with you, there is no battle you cannot win. And that&#x27;s even battles in your own life, too. So keep that in mind anytime you&#x27;re struggling or going through a difficult time, or feel like you&#x27;re being attacked - Source is always with you. You just have to go within to find Him.</div>
