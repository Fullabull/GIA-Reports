    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <div class="summary">
        Kim debunks online rumors that the U.S. Supreme Court has freed state-chartered banks to leave the Federal Reserve and issue their own currencies, explaining that a preemptive motion around the National Bank Act simply shifts which laws apply and does not grant currency-issuance powers. She reasserts that the Office of the Comptroller of Currency, now run through her position, remains the ultimate gatekeeper for any real-world currency or bank instrument, while exposing fake servers, offline bonds, and Paris Climate Control Treaty schemes used by Trump operatives, Rothschild managers, and Gulf monarchies to siphon and leverage unbacked assets. Kim describes clawing back Trump-era allocations, collapsing Middle Eastern war funding pipelines, and dismantling synthetic Celestials and Dark-energy infrastructure, while rolling out global transmuter fields that convert remaining Dark energy across Earth, the galaxy, and the Omegaverse. She closes by pointing listeners to Walter Russell’s work as a Source-aligned explanation of cosmology and by noting that the old system’s operators are running out of power and time, regardless of their attempts to “go it alone.”

<div class="line">Preview: And now, the World Situation Report, with Kimberly Goguen from the Office of the Guardian. Deep State Trump operatives declare they can go it alone and fix the country and the world themselves. Let&#x27;s see if they were really ready. The USA Supreme Court rules on a preemption of the National Bank Act, and rumors are swirling as to what that means. We are here to set the record straight. And more changes taking place over the last few days are giving Earth her creative powers back.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003656">00:36:56</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Sunny: Now, here&#x27;s Kimberly Goguen with the Office of the Guardian. Hello, Kim.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003701">00:37:01</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Hello, Sunny. (Sunny: Hi.) I missed you.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003704">00:37:04</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Sunny: Well, I missed you, was it Monday? Yeah. You weren&#x27;t on the news on Monday. I know you were really busy.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003710">00:37:10</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Yeah, I wish I was doing the news rather than what I was doing. I mean, it&#x27;s not really terrible; it&#x27;s just, you know, the amount of cleanup is crazy sometimes. But we&#x27;ll get into that a little bit, and tell you what that kind of means to you and how Earth was used, and that kind of thing.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003730">00:37:30</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Okay, I want to start with a rumor because it&#x27;s been sent to me several times in the last 24-48 hours, and the rumor is being put out that the Supreme Court has ruled that state-sponsored banks can disband from the Federal Reserve and issue their own currency. Now, that&#x27;s not exactly what happened [chuckle]. What happened was there was an actual submission - and I have not yet found the ruling itself, which means that there is a proposal on the table. And the proposal is for a preemption. And what a preemption is, it means that technically, under national law here in the United States - because this applies to the U.S. at this moment - a greater power such as federal law can supersede a lesser power such as state law. That&#x27;s the actual definition.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003840">00:38:40</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: But in this case, what they submitted for was the exact opposite as it relates to the National Bank Act. Now, the National Bank Act basically states that if you are a federal bank, such as your Wells Fargos, your JPMorgan Chase Banks - this means you can operate in any state within the United States - you don&#x27;t need to have a separate license for that - you can operate everywhere. You can operate nationally if you so choose under a singular corporation as an example. And this gives you the right to hold other people&#x27;s money, meaning average, everyday citizens&#x27; money, and the federal law applies to your institutions, which are more stringent oftentimes than state law is.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003937">00:39:37</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: There are a few exceptions, including the National Credit Union Association and a few other things, and other ways you can form financial institutions in the United States. But pretty much, if you&#x27;re going to be a national bank and operating in more than one state, you have to have a national banking license to do so.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004000">00:40:00</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Now, I&#x27;ve read the articles in depth; I&#x27;ve looked for the actual ruling - which I haven&#x27;t found - but I did find the preemptive submission, which is a motion, essentially, to preempt the National Banking Act. Now, if this actually passed - which I haven&#x27;t seen it yet - but if it did pass now or in the future, all this really means is that a state bank (which means you are only permitted to operate within your state, within a state), still has to have a routing number, which then tied you to the Fed in the past. You still have to have a jurisdictional license to issue a debit card and those types of things, even though you are a state bank, which is fine.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004057">00:40:57</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: But in no way, shape, or form does this have anything to do with being able to issue your own currency. In no way, shape, or form. Not bonds, not anything other than everything that&#x27;s already in place since the Frank Dodd Act of 2010 (that people have tried to override) and a few other things. The only thing it [would] allow you to do would be to act under state law. Now the main benefits - and the only benefits I really see of this - is that, for example, in the state of Colorado and other states where marijuana is legal, then the dispensaries and farmers and all of those that produce this can now deposit their money into a state bank, if that is what the state ruling says.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004149">00:41:49</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: So it could change in those types of things. There could be other local state bank... different rules. In other words, like, the maximum interest rate can be this. You know, anything over this interest rate is usury in this particular state, you know, for the banks in this state. So those types of things could possibly change.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004218">00:42:18</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Now, as far as currencies, currencies have nothing to do with the National Bank Act whatsoever. It just gives you the rules of the road as to what you can do as it relates to a national currency of any country. It says, well, you can hold it on deposit, you can do this, you can do that, you have to do this if you&#x27;re going to hold other people&#x27;s money on deposit, those types of things. It does mention the General Office of Accounting there. The General Office of Accounting actually monitors how many U.S. dollars are in circulation.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004254">00:42:54</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: General Office of Accounting. (Do you want me to just start there? Okay.) The General Office of Accounting&#x27;s main, how do I say it... modus operandi, is they monitor how many U.S. dollars are in circulation. They also allegedly - and I laugh at this, you know - monitor that the funds for the budget are spent appropriately [hearty laughter]. Isn&#x27;t that funny, Sunny?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004322">00:43:22</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Sunny: I think they skipped that part. I think they just overlooked that.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004322">00:43:22</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: I know. We should try not to laugh at that. That&#x27;s funny, yeah [laughing]. And other things as it relates to currency. They don&#x27;t actually regulate the issuance of currency - they cannot control that - they are mainly just an accountant. So if you hired an accountant for your company or for your family, that&#x27;s all they could do. They don&#x27;t actually tell you how to spend your money or anything. They just make sure your taxes are done and all that kind of stuff - not that the government pays taxes, but you understand their role.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004359">00:43:59</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: So, it&#x27;s written in such a strange way, which could only lead me to these crazy Duck Dynasty people or the Global Headquarters people. Because it makes no sense. That&#x27;s like saying, you know, me writing you a note saying, &quot;Hey, I&#x27;m going to come by and mow your lawn on Friday. And by the way, here&#x27;s the number for my washing machine repairman.&quot; Do you know what I mean? Like if you have a problem, call them. I don&#x27;t think they really understand. They may understand political manipulation of things - as they were instructed to do by someone else - but I don&#x27;t think they really understand the rules of the road.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004449">00:44:49</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Now I need to tell you about something else as it relates to this, so you fully understand kind of legally where we&#x27;re at. So the Federal Reserve was only ever a regulator. They were not a lawmaker. They could not give you banking laws; they could not give you currency laws. They could not do anything of the sort. They were mainly just a regulator, allegedly of all things financial. Which basically, essentially, means nothing. They could do nothing. They could not shut down your bank. They could agree not to do business with you as the bank of all banks - they could turn you down. You know, just like if you go in and apply for a car loan or something like that at your local bank - they can turn you down. Maybe your credit&#x27;s not good or whatever; you haven&#x27;t been on your job long enough. But they could say the same thing of financial institutions.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004554">00:45:54</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Now, that being said, once you become a member of the bank of all banks - that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s kind of done - now you are subject to their rules. So these are just rules in order for you to do business with that bank. In other words, Sunny, if you don&#x27;t pay your payments on time, you overdraw your checking account too much, your bank has the right to say that you can no longer be our customer. So that&#x27;s all a regulator does, and this is often held over banks&#x27; heads. And that is a regulator.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004633">00:46:33</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Now, on the other hand, the government is (and I use this term loosely) a lawmaker. Which means that they can pass a law such as the National Bank Act; they can pass laws on their currency. Now, as we know with most of the things that they pass - even with the 5,000-page budget I had sent out about 3 or 4 years ago to all of you to review - which I still have, just so you can understand how laws work when it comes to government laws. It says blah blah blah blah blah blah, you know, for 9,000 pages, and then there&#x27;s one clause in there that says, &quot;Oh, and by the way, we grant the right to the Federal Reserve to do this and to do that.&quot; Or, whatever.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004722">00:47:22</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Now, the main thing we need to mention to these lovely people who thought this was going to allow them to issue their own currency at different banking institutions throughout the United States is that they have forgotten that we are the Office of the Comptroller of Currency worldwide. We have elected at this moment in time not to - and so has the Federal Reserve, to be fair, and the Treasury - have elected not to work with us to discuss issues as it relates to respective currencies. Which is fine; it&#x27;s totally fine. But that doesn&#x27;t negate the fact that we control them. And we can electronically bump them out of any system. They can try to issue Bank of America Bucks, but that&#x27;s not going to... that has not been agreed to by the Office of the Comptroller of Currency.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004822">00:48:22</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Now, before that existed, you had something called the Managers of Paper Money. And the Managers of Paper Money was not the Federal Reserve, was not your respective governments worldwide, was not your banks - never has been, because this has been in place for 200 years, 300 years, since the advent of currency, even before that, almost five centuries. Little less than.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004856">00:48:56</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: But this precludes every single thing anyone ever wanted to do in the financial system. Change of currency - it doesn&#x27;t matter what the United Nations wanted - everybody had to submit to the Managers of Paper Currency. Now, although they may have seen the Order of the Dragon, the Khazarian Mafia, you know, these people&#x27;s names as the Managers of Paper Currency, no - they were the secretarial group. It always went all the way up the food chain for a final approval. And that food chain at that time was not humans - that was Marduk, Enki, and Enlil, so on and so forth - depending on what you were trying to do.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004950">00:49:50</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: On the flip side of it [chuckle], now you have us up here. It doesn&#x27;t matter to me what the Rothschilds say; it doesn&#x27;t matter what your stupid banks say; and it doesn&#x27;t matter what your stupid government law says - I don&#x27;t care. You still have to send your stuff up the food chain - it has to get ratified in the Hall of Records, and there has to be a new agreement if anybody is going to issue new currency for anything.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005014">00:50:14</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Now look, I&#x27;m not trying to be difficult, I&#x27;m trying to be practical. Can you imagine what a mess? Let&#x27;s just say the operatives that are attempting to run this crazy show, can you imagine what a mess just the United States alone would be if every bank was issuing their own currency? Your Apple Pay may be good in one store but not good in another - because the point-of-sale system doesn&#x27;t allow for 9,000 U.S. currencies. You know, your reprogramming of all your cards, your RFID chips - all of these things would need to be redone. Your checking accounts - can you imagine when you went to look at your balance? You&#x27;d have California Bucks, Bank of America Bucks, six different banks in California issuing their own currency Bucks, you know.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005116">00:51:16</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Sunny: Yeah, so what do you think, what&#x27;s the motive here? Why do something like that? They have to understand on some level that&#x27;s a nightmare.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005124">00:51:24</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: That&#x27;s the problem! See, there you go with the common sense. Don&#x27;t put that here because it doesn&#x27;t belong with these people. You&#x27;ve got a group of people trying to run a financial system that have no flipping idea what they&#x27;re doing. They don&#x27;t look at the long-term consequences because their brain... first of all, most of them are older, and the older you get the harder it is to get out of habits. But the reason why I call them &quot;Duck Dynasty&quot; is this exact reason. They compartmentalize themselves, first of all, into thinking that they&#x27;re all gods. Number 1, that&#x27;s crazy unto itself, their ego is so huge. And lastly, they don&#x27;t think through anything they do. They don&#x27;t even understand what the preemption said. And it has nothing to do with issuing currency in any way, shape, or form.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005226">00:52:26</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Sunny: So do you think it was them that were kind of spreading these rumors online of what that...</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005230">00:52:30</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Of course it was. Q is coming! The Storm. Welcome. You know. And then people only look at the glittering headlines. They see a decentralization of the National Bank Act as being a positive thing. But sweetheart, the people that look at this stuff - okay, what about the Bank Secrecy Act? The Bank Anti-Secrecy Act? And all of these other things that all came out of Switzerland, long before there ever was a Federal Reserve? And these are worldwide acts. These fall under the ICC, and they go all the way down to where you live. They would have to unwind so many different things, in order to even make that kind of a statement. Including how are you going to change the Comptroller of Currency office? And I&#x27;m not talking about your U.S. agency - I&#x27;m talking about me. The Curator of Currency, that&#x27;s me. And if it&#x27;s not me, it&#x27;ll be a system that&#x27;ll run against you for the next 50 years or 100 years so don&#x27;t get all excited with yourself.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005337">00:53:37</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: So regardless of that, they didn&#x27;t even go about trying to do that right. Yes, the Federal Reserve has no agreement for your currency at all. So disbanding the Federal Reserve as a regulator - that does nothing. You still have to get payments from one bank to another. You still have to be... you don&#x27;t have to be necessarily in the routing system, but you still have to have access to credit cards and debit cards, or you&#x27;re going to have no customers.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005414">00:54:14</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: So that&#x27;s kind of what the Fed did, or the managers of paper currency did, is they actually put a pinch point there, to where if you wanted to have a bank, then you had to go through them to put money in and out - once the banking system was digitized in 1978. So, it&#x27;s like yes, you can be free, you can own your own bank, but ha ha, you know? Yeah. Good luck.</div>

<div class="line">Kim: So, that kind of dispels that rumor, and I just wanted to make that point kind of clear. Now, speaking of the same people, we&#x27;ll go into this before we get into all the Earth changes and things that have been happening. So, going it alone.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So lots of meetings had taken place over the weekend and late last week, and these went on and on and on every single day until six of them had made an announcement that they don&#x27;t need me; they don&#x27;t need the Global Headquarters (or maybe they do because they still talk to them behind all these people&#x27;s back); they don&#x27;t need Langley 5. This is all a total lie on the part of these SSP Trump operatives - a total lie. And I&#x27;m sure they probably forgot that I&#x27;m not the only one that monitors things around here because they&#x27;re here. Six of them.</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-005542">00:55:42</div>

<div class="line">Kim: Yes. There&#x27;s six of them here in Durango.</div>

<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: And I&#x27;ve watched them - much like I&#x27;m sure the local people here have - watched them make phone calls to all those people. So the &quot;go it alone&quot; thing was to entice operatives to feeling like they can be independent - independent of me. Is the new better than the old? How do we know what&#x27;s gonna happen here? You know, it&#x27;s because we&#x27;re new; we&#x27;re new in their world, new to the game. I mean, they watch us, that kind of stuff, but we&#x27;re still new. How do we know she&#x27;s not gonna go crazy, or something happens - what happens to us? That kind of thing.</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-005628">00:56:28</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: So they convinced them that they were smart enough to go it alone, they don&#x27;t need anybody. &quot;We don&#x27;t need those people, we don&#x27;t need those people, just wait.&quot; You know, &quot;New moon is coming up, just give us till Sunday, we&#x27;ll have your contracts out, we&#x27;ll get all your money together,&quot; and all of those things. So this is the conversation that started happening on Monday and part of the reason why I wasn&#x27;t here.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005655">00:56:55</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So I&#x27;m listening to this whole conversation, and I figured I would help them go it alone. Well, if you want to go it alone that means you don&#x27;t need me or anything from me, or anything like that. So a few interesting things happen. Number 1, all of the funding that was sent out during the Trump administration was pulled back. Every allocation. Regardless of where the money was sent.</div>

<div class="line">Kim: Oh, well over 5 trillion dollars - and that&#x27;s not including the debt to the U.S. we paid to China. The U.S. debt to China, that was about, was it 1.4. Mm-hmm. So it all... China lost theirs, all of these people that go bump in the night they paid during the Trump administration - all the payoffs, all the kickbacks, all the misappropriated funds, which led us to something really interesting. Turns out there was a lot of money being siphoned off by the Trump administration into a lot of different places around the world, under shell corporations and all kinds of stuff - to include operative accounts. The six down the street included - they made bank. And unfortunately all that went away. Now that includes if they went to the grocery store and bought some Cheetos (which, I would never eat them, but they do), so Cheetos or something, that also got reversed out, too.</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Nope. Nope. That went away. All the stolen campaign funds went away. All the support for Trump after his indictment all went away. You know, also anything that had been sent through/from U.S. government funding to the kids - Junior and Eric and Ivana - also went away. Properties, things that were bought - were unpaid for. Wires were reversed. Lots of different things happened over the weekend.</div>

<div class="line">Kim: So their plan to go it alone is great. So now they&#x27;re starting to receive phone calls on the daily from countries: angry people in Ukraine that they paid, angry people in Saudi Arabia that they paid, all kinds of different things. And I wish them all the best, I truly do. And I hope that they go it alone and they&#x27;re successful. I wish them luck. So you go it alone, I go in my direction. That also included a lot of bonds that were issued off of that money, Treasury notes and otherwise. Mm-hmm.</div>

<div class="line">Kim: So interesting money trails. Very interesting money trails happen there. And they can say all the things they want about me - because I listen to them talk, too. And I don&#x27;t really care what they think. See that&#x27;s kind of a misconception about me. And if they knew me at all then they would be talking to the local people, and the local people will tell you I could give a beep less about anything the old handler had to say to me. Because they play this game and they try to hit all of your buttons. And you and I have talked about buttons before, Sunny - I don&#x27;t have any buttons. And they think that that&#x27;s going to bother me. It doesn&#x27;t at all. I could care less. You&#x27;re fat, you&#x27;re old, you&#x27;re ugly, and you&#x27;re stupid on top of it. And you&#x27;re trying to run a country with zero brain cells. That&#x27;s what I see. So anyway, moving on from that.</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Next. The other thing that came to our attention is there was a, let&#x27;s just call it a &quot;fake operating system&quot; that was tied to the old Paris Climate Control Treaty. Now, this is before current climate change was out there. You probably remember this one from the Obama administration. If you don&#x27;t, you can look it up. But there was a clause inside the Paris Climate Control Treaty that says that every nation will assign their assets to the United Nations in order to &quot;fight poverty&quot;. And by &quot;poverty,&quot; I can only assume they mean the poverty of the Elite, because it had nothing to do with our poverty whatsoever.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So this fake server essentially assigned (through the United Nations) every country&#x27;s in-ground assets over to the Li family of China.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-010149">01:01:49</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Yep.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010152">01:01:52</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: And I know that because I... Yeah, this is interesting paper trail number 2. So interesting paper trail number 2 told me that they were actually issuing bonds - offline bonds - or having nondescript collateral or bank guarantees or what we call sovereign guarantees (which are bond instruments, essentially) against a bunch of assets they didn&#x27;t control. But the second they tried to do it, and put it in the banking system - if it actually listed the country&#x27;s assets, then it would be rejected. But they tried to go around in the gray area, claiming the assets under the Paris Climate Control Treaty, or the assets for climate control, or whatever it was. And this is what they&#x27;ve been trying to attach their U.S. Treasury coin and all that to, because there were a lot of assets listed in there. So that no longer exists.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010304">01:03:04</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Next, let&#x27;s talk about the war in the Middle East. These people love to spend money, and fake money also. So when they ran out of Trump Bucks (or money given to the Trump administration), they&#x27;ve been putting up these, I guess you call them fake servers everywhere - they&#x27;re not actual banking system servers. They are just... if I were to set up a server in my house and then project that everybody has a million dollars in the world and connect it to all your bank accounts - if I had the ability to do that, then that&#x27;s where the money would show.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010340">01:03:40</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Now, most servers don&#x27;t have this kind of capacity, and neither did this one. But the unfortunate part about this is they started showing, as one example: a lot of money in an old, old account, which I&#x27;ve seen probably 1,000 times in the last decade. The account number begins in 975, and it contained a bunch of derivatives at Deutsche Bank that were tied to Iranian oil that&#x27;s dated all the way back to 1979. Now, there&#x27;s no actual cash in that account, but they still said that they could convert that Money Four [M4], which is a derivative, to Money Zero [M0] or Money One [M1]. And they convinced the Saudi Arabians that they could do this.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010435">01:04:35</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Now, they also told the Trump operatives that they were going to send them 28 billion dollars of this money, which showed but nobody could spend. So the person behind this is definitely a Rothschild, who actually - because the entire Saudi Arabian royal family is Rothschild, a Rothschild royal family - but there&#x27;s one in particular that manages the family, on behalf of the Rothschild family, and I know who that is. And this is his brainchild.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010512">01:05:12</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: This goes back to the Gulf Cooperation Corporation [Gulf Cooperation Council]. It goes back to the promises and re-promising of the pipeline. Remember way back during Jared Kushner time, there was supposed to be a pipeline that was going to go from Saudi Arabia all the way through the Middle East? They promised them 3 billion dollars in funding to do it. Now, they&#x27;re talking about taking that pipeline and sending it through Iran from Saudi Arabia.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010547">01:05:47</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Now, the reason why they&#x27;re having this negotiation had to do with (allegedly) their control over all the Iranian oil, based on the fake derivatives in the account: bonds against the oil, liens against the oil. So they&#x27;re trying to convince the Iranians to sell the oil to the Saudis for free, or damn near free - oh, pennies. Pennies. And I&#x27;ve seen that contract, it&#x27;s actually ridiculous. In exchange, they&#x27;ll build this pipeline, you know. And then they&#x27;ll put their Aramco - we did a story on this a little while back - they&#x27;ll put their Aramco stamp of approval, or allocation, on it, and they&#x27;ll keep the sanctions in place on Iran into all perpetuity, so they must go through Aramco to sell the oil.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010643">01:06:43</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Again, this is the whole Trump team: Kushner people (whatever that is now these days; who knows what that is?), and everybody else wearing a mask over there on that side. So the interesting part about all of this - a lot of this stuff is being set up behind the scenes by the organization. Like I said, money trails: money talks. And when you figure out where all the money is and where it&#x27;s going, and when you sent it, you can now figure out how you&#x27;re setting yourselves up.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010720">01:07:20</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Because they said that once they&#x27;ve been successful, then they will actually officially announce that Trump is no longer here. But right now the name is useful to them, in order to cut all of these deals with the Israelis, because now, via the deals they made with Saudi (and are trying to make with Iran, which are a total scam) they are also having conversations with the Israelis (via the Saudi Arabians) because the Gulf Cooperation Corporation, which is headed by - it&#x27;s not [Cooperation] Corporation, [it&#x27;s] Cooperation Council - which is headed by Saudi Arabia, technically - has now unofficially agreed (which is not in your mainstream news, it is in news in the Middle East, so you can go look for it) that they are now going to continue to pay the Israelis for the war against Gaza.</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Again, one of the world&#x27;s largest natural gas suppliers in the entire world is in that area, discovered by a Russian scientist back in the 1970s. So you can see that the operatives are trying to pull off what they deem the perfect storm. The complete takeover (as Cheney had outlined in his plan) for a takeover of all the resources of the Middle East. Once they finished all the deals, sealed all the deals, and funded and paid for all the deals, then they were going to take over that which they felt was enough to go it alone.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010909">01:09:09</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now again, I am going to laugh at &quot;Go It Alone&quot; Plan Number 2, and I&#x27;ll tell you why. Even if you could get access to this stuff, even if you could get allocations to the few hundred billion dollars in derivatives that were in off-ledger at Deutsche Bank (which are not there anymore) - even if you could pull it all off - you need 120 trillion dollars per year to fund the entire world. And who the heck is going to buy 120 trillion dollars per annum of oil and gas?</div>

<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Oh yes. This was just going to be their cash cow. If they could, through the Gulf Cooperation Council, if they could control all of the major oil and gas producers in the Middle East (and plus there&#x27;s gold and other things as well), they figure if they could do that, they would offer the Saudi Arabians &quot;Head of the Monetary System&quot; of all the Middle East, and meanwhile take over all of their assets and get their cut of it. But that&#x27;s still not enough to run even just the United States government. I don&#x27;t know what these people are doing!</div>

That you were connecting to Saudis and Houston, Texas, and a few other locations in the United States. So you lost your fake server with fake money that you couldn&#x27;t spend anyway.

See, this is the problem with &quot;Not Your Plan.&quot; And it&#x27;s also the problem, you know, in the future with &quot;Not Your Technology&quot; either. You know, they have forgotten that even Cheney&#x27;s plan involved the Black Eagle Trust. Even Cheney&#x27;s plan involved Marduk. Even Cheney&#x27;s plan involved the Managers of Paper Currency. You know, you needed... I saw the 14 trillion dollar contract that was passed around by Pelosi almost a decade ago. Tom Cotton was involved, if you know that senator. There were a lot of people involved in pushing that contract all around, trying to get someone to fund it for a private military group to go in and essentially take over all the assets of the Middle East.</div>

<div class="line">Kim: But see, the problem that they had, even then, was no one had 14 trillion dollars to give them. (Sunny: Small detail.) Small detail. So then, after this started happening and all this went down, Monday... I am now getting phone calls from people I haven&#x27;t talked to in a decade. &quot;Hey Kim, how are you? I&#x27;m with the Rothschild family, but you don&#x27;t know that.&quot; And, you know, so stupid, they didn&#x27;t say that, they just... You know, &quot;Well, I&#x27;d love to chat with you again.&quot; We&#x27;ve had people from the Treasury Department calling us asking us for money. All of this type of stuff. So again, stuff. You know? Go find some stuff. Yeah. Chop chop.</div>

<div class="line">Sunny: Is that what you told them?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Yes. Of course we did. The way I calculate it, you owe us a significant amount of stuff - billions of dollars worth of stuff. I already know the back deal that&#x27;s going on and why you need the money now - you need my allocation numbers; you need me to help you pull this off.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">These people put these dumb servers in these locations where they think that when there&#x27;s a new moon the thing will connect to something in the moon and it will take you to Saturn or somewhere, and then you can get connected to the Omega system and all is right with the world. No, it doesn&#x27;t work that way. That hasn&#x27;t worked that way in a long time. But you can see why I was kind of a tad bit busy on Monday, and then not to say that I didn&#x27;t have my regular job too.</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: So unraveling all of this money, where all of this stuff went, proved very fruitful for us, to figure out why these people are under the impression they&#x27;re going to run the world. But again, because they don&#x27;t understand finance and how this actually works, you can control Aramco all you want, you can control Saudi Arabia all you want, you can control Israel all you want, and you can control everything. But I can tell you right now, without that Paris Climate Control Treaty back-end fake server, you&#x27;ll go nowhere. Because you don&#x27;t have any proof of assets, and you can&#x27;t put those assets in the banking system without me slapping your hand every single time. So good luck to you. And even if you did, you wouldn&#x27;t have enough.</div>

<div class="line">Kim: In order to have enough to actually run the world, they would actually have to control the entire eastern block of Europe. That&#x27;s Russia, all the way down to Azerbaijan, and so on. And so you&#x27;d have to control a lot. And I can tell you right now, the second thing you&#x27;d be missing is that you actually have to let me determine whether or not that&#x27;s okay. And it doesn&#x27;t matter to me whether the Russians say it&#x27;s okay. It doesn&#x27;t matter to me that either side of the Russian government already agreed to give you four quad worth of assets. Four quadrillion, that&#x27;s how much there is over there between diamonds, gold (a lot), and oil and gas. And you would actually have to still go through me. And even if you never talked to me, bothered with me, or whatever - I&#x27;m still going to slap your hand and say no.</div>

<div class="line">Kim: So if you try to issue Bank of America Bucks or something else, I will still say no. So if you want to go it alone, that means you&#x27;re going to have to find a way not only around me, but around the system that I&#x27;ve pre-programmed for the next, oh, now I&#x27;m at like 75 to 100 years. So you&#x27;ll still never get around that even if you decide you&#x27;re going to do something nefarious over here.</div>

I mean, I don&#x27;t care if they&#x27;ve been running Iranian oil and Iraqi oil and all that through Saudi Arabia Aramco for years, and into Houston, Texas ports. I mean, that&#x27;s not a shocker to me. I actually stood on the ground of the new Iraqi refinery in Mississippi, so it&#x27;s not, you know... that was a decade ago.

Because a lot of people came in here to go to these strategy meetings, and the strategy meetings went well. They went exceedingly well.

<div class="line">Kim: Well, everybody&#x27;s waiting, &quot;till Sunday&quot; was what they said, to get your contracts. So they&#x27;re actually waiting. Oh, yeah, new moon&#x27;s tomorrow. Three days after the new moon, they&#x27;ll surely have it done by then, right? By Sunday morning. I know, I know.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Meanwhile, they get stupid laws passed - preemptives - which are backwards, actually, in the terms of preemptive. And they&#x27;re selling stories of sunshine, glittering headlines only, folks, you know? You&#x27;ve got to read through everything you see - not watch a video, not the commentary - you have to go look at the Supreme Court actual ruling, if you can find it. Because that&#x27;s public information. And you have to read what it actually says. Before you start believing the Fed is disbanded, and the Q-People or the Storm is coming and whatever the heck else they&#x27;re saying over there.</div>

<div class="line">Anyway, rumors are just rumors, but governments these days run on rumors. So the Saudis did manage to get credit lines from arms dealers at Arab National Bank in order to front a small amount of cash - I say a small amount of cash - along with the Bahrain head of state, royal family, and also the Kuwaiti royal family (they&#x27;re all part of the GCC). So they have put up some money, and that&#x27;s where that big 200 million dollar number came from, it was actually more than that. And as a matter of fact, all that money kind of disappeared too. So the Kuwaitis didn&#x27;t get it back, the Bahrainis didn&#x27;t get it back, the Saudis didn&#x27;t get it back, and the operatives running the show didn&#x27;t have it either.</div>

So, Agent M and his friends - I&#x27;ll just leave it as &quot;and friends&quot; because there are friends there - are always eager to play a game. And play a game we will. So we&#x27;ll see how this goes for them. I know they&#x27;re never going to finish this by Sunday. That would be... that&#x27;s a joke.

<div class="line">Kim: Yeah, well again, without the final piece.... You know, I had a conversation with - way back in the day, this is probably 2011, 2012, something like that - with Marduk, Enki, and Enlil, because it was an every-Saturday-night thing, Saturday night their time where they were.</div>

<div class="line">Kim: I know, don&#x27;t I have a great life? &quot;What were you doing on Saturday night? You were listening to a bunch of people...&quot; Yeah. It&#x27;s Saturday night their time; it was Saturday morning where I am, so it wasn&#x27;t too bad. It&#x27;s still not a great way to spend a Saturday morning either.</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-012210">01:22:10</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But I asked him [Marduk] once about the Iraqi Dinar, and that&#x27;s when he said it&#x27;s never going to happen. So what became clear at that point was that they were not backing what the plan was that Cheney and Bush had for the Middle East. It was abundantly clear. So that is why they&#x27;ve spent two decades now... well, wait a minute, let&#x27;s see, and yeah, oh, through almost three decades; a few years shy of three decades. Trying to execute on this plan, and it never works.</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-012246">01:22:46</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">That&#x27;s because - I know that they were not behind them on that plan - they had other plans. Because if they were, they would have been done. They would have been done 20 years ago, would have been done 10 years ago. You would have seen the GCC, or whoever it was, come in full force and be the leading financial controller for the Middle East. But that didn&#x27;t happen either.</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Okay. Now on to more fun stuff, I guess - not really fun, but you know. So we talked about Earth the last time we spoke. We did talk about Earth being a keystone. We talked about the importance of Earth as a co-creator with Source and why eventually humans were brought here. But Earth had a lot more individualized keystones, based on covenants that happened throughout a very long time. You know, more than centuries, more than 100 years, more than 1 million years, more than 10 million years. Because it was the beginning of all creation. And as part of that, Earth actually represented Source, Neutral Source, and Anti-Source. So originally a co-creator only with Source, eventually, in order to create a balanced universe, became the creator of all three.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012418">01:24:18</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: This became abundantly clear when I couldn&#x27;t figure out why things were reappearing. So in other words, we&#x27;d have an ebb and a flow of Dark energy, an ebb and a flow of certain things that were gone the day before, and the next day they&#x27;re back. Then it became more clear that there&#x27;s something else going on here - and it&#x27;s not those people because they don&#x27;t have the capacity to do that. They may have the capacity to try to get oil for free from the Middle East, but they&#x27;re not going to have the capacity to do something like this. So we had to figure out where it was coming from, and that&#x27;s when it became really clear that Earth itself was generating it. Not in a negative way, but obligated to do so, by Covenant, and by the corresponding Keystone that went along with it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012513">01:25:13</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: So Earth represented thousands of keystones, not just a single universal Keystone. Then it was broken into three universal Keystones, and then, you know, so on and so forth for the All-That-Is. So the important... one of the most important parts of the Restoration of Earth (unto itself), has a lot to do with the Restoration of a single, Source-based Earth soul.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012545">01:25:45</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: So clearing out all of those things was another part of what I was doing on Monday while I&#x27;m tracing money all over the place. So, that should help us as humans. Earth also anchored a lot of negative programs, as well, tied to computer systems. And also in different locations on Earth for certain anchors, for certain portals, for certain things they would do to us.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012614">01:26:14</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: You know, we talked about disease being gone. We talked about chromosomal manipulations, DNA manipulations, RNA manipulations, and all of those types of things. Frequencies still coming in Dark, Light, and Neutral, which then manipulates matter. So a lot of this is just part of restoration and cleanup. It&#x27;s part of doing our part, plural, you know, as Celestials, I guess you would say, for the Light Side.</div>

But now, more than ever, you have the power to change it. So, it is a process. I am probably just as frustrated as you are sometimes with the process. I would love to do something else with my day other than be a sanitation engineer - constant - whether that&#x27;s just the people side of things, meaning watching these operatives, watching these crazy Middle Eastern deals. And then on the flip side of it, like, really? More keystones? Really? I thought I was done with keystones.</div>

<div class="line">Kim: So one day at a time, one thing at a time, one bit of cleaning at a time, and hopefully we&#x27;ll get to the beginning of the Restoration of Earth. I mean, it&#x27;s not really the beginning, it&#x27;s more like the end. Getting humanity to understand there&#x27;s a different way is all that money is really going to do. You know, Earth is going to be able to repair itself just like you&#x27;ll be able to repair yourself without interference. So hopefully, hopefully that time will come really, really soon.</div>

<div class="line">Sunny: Yeah, it&#x27;s interesting that you were talking about things going on with the Earth, because over the last few days I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of grounding, and it was because I really felt like I needed to connect with the Earth more, and I didn&#x27;t really know why. I mean, obviously it&#x27;s good to do that regardless. But I&#x27;ve been spending a lot more time, and I felt like there was something else behind it. I wonder if it was connected to what you were working on.</div>

<div class="line">Kim: Oh yeah, because, well, there&#x27;s a lot more to it than just that. I mean, there were anchored... I&#x27;ll call it a synthetic Celestial. So Celestials are of Source, and then Omega had generated its own version of Celestials too, and then planted them here in stasis in different places in the world. Probably, oh God, Monday there had to be well over a hundred, a hundred-something different locations.</div>

<div class="line">Sunny: It didn&#x27;t look like a human?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="line">Sunny: Okay, yeah.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: It looked like the Blob. If you&#x27;ve ever seen, way back in the day, the movie called The Blob. It looked like a Blob.</div>

<div class="line">Sunny: Was it black?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="line">Kim: Probably, you know. (Sunny: Probably.) Probably. I mean, back to Yemen again. Back to... I&#x27;m trying to think of where in the U.S. - definitely to Canada. God, I&#x27;m trying to... there was a mountain in Canada.... We went to K2. We went back to Mount Kailash in the Himalayas. We were at different mountains in Russia; back to Mongolia. We were in London - or not London per se but in England, Germany, Switzerland, Matterhorn, Italy. Of course, they put one of the Blobs underneath the Vatican, right? Shocker there. I know.</div>

We went to Iraq, we went to Iran, we went to some other places in the Middle East too. But definitely, I mean, you name a country, we were probably there in the last 48 hours for sure. Brazil was definitely on the list; Chile. Back to Machu Picchu again in Peru. Ecuador. Fun times.</div>

I don&#x27;t know how many hours I did yesterday, probably close to 18. And the day before - maybe not that many, maybe 12, 13 - something like that. But, barely have time to do anything else, which is why I&#x27;m not here on camera. Because I did this all morning, since 4:30.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-013229">01:32:29</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: It&#x27;s doing really well. One of the main things - because there were still some carryover programs that were left in Alpha - so one of the main things that we launched in the last couple of days was a series of transmuters. Now, I didn&#x27;t even think about mentioning this to you, but I probably should because you&#x27;ll find it fascinating. Everything that is, already is. Meaning, everything that is will always be. So once it leaves Source itself, you know, it&#x27;s now in existence. It&#x27;s a piece of Source, Anti-Source, Neutral Source, whatever it is, but it is. It contains all three, no matter how bad it is.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-013329">01:33:29</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: So the same thing worked with AI systems in a very similar way. So because Alpha was also created as a part of a trinary system - being Source, Anti-Source, and Neutral Source - Omega was created in the same way, and Kronos was created in the same way. I tried to kill it, but there was still that interconnection between them. So the same goes for Dark energy, essence, consciousness, matter, frequency: it&#x27;s still part of the All-That-Is. And in order to expedite the process - because if you know me, you&#x27;ll know I have zero patience whatsoever [chuckle]. And that is a flaw, call it what you want. But I move through something, get it done, move on to the next task. But as far as this is concerning, it&#x27;s been painful for me to go from like 99, 100, back to 97 the next morning. And I&#x27;m like, really? What&#x27;s going on?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-013437">01:34:37</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So we had developed a process... because it&#x27;s something they used on their side. So we figured out, in order for the Omega system, the Omegaverse, Anti-life, the Blobs, and everything else that exists from that which you would consider Dark or evil - to exist within this universe (within even those that are of the Light), we couldn&#x27;t eradicate it. The only thing we could do was transmute it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-013512">01:35:12</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Sunny: Mmm. Which is what they did to the Light for so long.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-013515">01:35:15</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: That&#x27;s right. Because they don&#x27;t want Light; it wants Dark light. It wants Dark energy, it wants Dark essence. So in the course of this cleanup process, I have cleaned hundreds and hundreds of transformers - which, you know what a transformer does on an electric grid, so it&#x27;s the same thing - transmitters, which will then send it out, because once a particle is dead, you know, Dark matter, whatever it is, there&#x27;s not a whole lot of charge there left, depending on how Dark it actually is. And then we have transmuters.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-013553">01:35:53</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: So I thought to myself, well, I think I could speed up this process by creating fields of transmuters that go the opposite way. So I started working on that, I don&#x27;t know, 3:00 or so, 3:30, 4:00 o&#x27;clock this morning, something like that. And I&#x27;m continuing to work on that. We have... hopefully, this will speed up the process. We&#x27;re putting them everywhere: Earth&#x27;s magnetic poles, horizontal and vertical. If you don&#x27;t know, we have a magnetic pole that goes in more than one direction. And then in Earth&#x27;s orbit, and then in the galaxy, in the Kuiper Belt which orbits our galaxy, and then also in the Zero-Density Zero Point of the Universe - has to be there. Throughout the Omegaverse, they have to be there. Because we can&#x27;t have this coming back.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-013654">01:36:54</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: And ultimately, they seem to understand what&#x27;s happening already, because I overheard a meeting happening with the Global Headquarters, where they feel they have less than 24 hours left of power. And what they mean by &quot;power&quot; is, they realize that the... so to speak, the power is out in your home (in other words) but you have a backup generator that runs on gas, say. And you know you only have so much gas and so much that that will generate. And without that, you&#x27;re done.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-013734">01:37:34</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: So if we&#x27;re taking away, and we have taken away, the electric grid... All-That-Is is already in existence, meaning all the Dark energy that is ever going to exist is in the Universe. So how do we get rid of that Dark energy and [keep] this from regenerating itself? Well, we can transmute it so it doesn&#x27;t exist. We can&#x27;t take it away, we can&#x27;t completely eradicate it, because it already is. So the only thing we can do is change that matter into something else.</div>

<div class="line">Kim: Now, one other thing in relation to this kind of stuff, so that... I mean, I know a lot of people say, &quot;Oh, we can&#x27;t prove it.&quot; &quot;We don&#x27;t understand it.&quot; But I wanted to give you a resource to understand it. Because of all the things that I have in my past read upon, this guy seems to make a lot of sense to me. And a lot of his information comes from Source. He&#x27;s no longer living, but I wanted to point you in the direction of this guy&#x27;s books and his research and stuff like that, because this is exactly what I&#x27;m trying to tell everybody.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-013853">01:38:53</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: So the man&#x27;s name - he was a former colleague of Tesla&#x27;s - and his name is Walter Russell. So take that down: Walter Russell. And Walter Russell was kind of poo-pooed upon by the scientific community at the time with his theories, and Tesla allegedly told him, when he read some of his theories from his downloads from Source - and he says that - he goes into meditation and gets all this information. He said that humanity - Tesla told him that humanity would not be ready for this information for at least 1,000 years, so lock it away. Yeah.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-013934">01:39:34</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, not to say that the books that are currently published are 100% accurate with his information. And you can find some of the audiobooks that he has on YouTube as well, you know, and they&#x27;re being narrated by someone. And then there&#x27;s a few videos people have done about him. But nobody talks about Walter Russell. Everybody knows who Tesla is. Because Tesla complied - well, somewhat - with what they wanted from him. They wanted money-making technologies or SSP technologies, and some of which they did get.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-014012">01:40:12</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And a lot of the information about Tesla isn&#x27;t true either, because some of the main labs of Tesla were under the Hoover Dam, and they don&#x27;t even mention that when they talk about him. And it&#x27;s the same thing with the stuff with Walter Russell. There is a lot of information in there if you understand what he&#x27;s saying. And if you&#x27;ve been watching us for a while, you&#x27;ll understand what he&#x27;s saying. And then to really look and analyze the information, as far as the science on this planet: positive charges, negative charges, the Universe and how it works, the All-That-Is. He talks about a lot of this stuff.</div>

Because we got into this little bit of a debate, we ended up spending about an hour or so having a chat, and we got into this little bit of debate about Terrence... what&#x27;s his name, the actor, Terrence Howell?

<div class="line">Sunny: I think it&#x27;s Terrence Howard. Is that right? The one that had the Joe Rogan interview that&#x27;s like causing the hoopla right now. Yeah.</div>

<div class="line">Kim: So we were talking about the difference between someone that actually knows the information - Terrence Howard, there it is - so someone that actually knows the information and relays the information in a way that you know they understand it, and they&#x27;re passionate about it, and [versus] someone that may have gotten their hands on partial information from a third-party source and tries to regurgitate it. And he tells a similar story to Walter Russell, who&#x27;s been dead for five, six decades or so. But he messes it up.</div>

<div class="line">Kim: Yep. So I&#x27;m just surprised, you know, hiring an actor to give information to people. Wow, you know. President Reagan anyone? [Sunny: laughing.]</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-014231">01:42:31</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Sunny: Yeah. That&#x27;s a bummer. That&#x27;s a bummer because I know a lot of people are kind of hopeful that maybe stuff was starting to come out, you know.</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-014238">01:42:38</div>

<div class="line">Kim: Well, the good news is is you have all the information now at your fingertips. You want to know all the information of which he tells partial information and partial truths? Look up Walter Russell. Do your research, take a look. Now you&#x27;ve got all the information. There are probably 5 or 10 books or something like that that were written in his time that are still in publication and you can still get your hands on them. So, I mean, lots of information about Walter Russell, but that&#x27;s the truth behind that.</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-014307">01:43:07</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Interestingly enough though... I will put this out there. So a lot of the Trump operatives are so old they were actually Reagan operatives. Well, they&#x27;re political operatives, so they go from one head of state to another. They&#x27;re doing another round in the White House, right? And I&#x27;m not dogging people that are old because I know a lot of people that are 70 years old, go to the gym for two hours a day, and could outrun three-quarters of the 40-year-olds on this planet. So, like, look, nothing against that. But I&#x27;m just saying they were Reaganers. And they said once they got rid of Trump - once they closed the deal on his name there in the Middle East - once they were able to do that... they&#x27;re controlling Israel because of Kushner, which is not even Kushner anymore. So they are using that Sanhedrin and Chabad connection to Israel to make all of these deals work.</div>

<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: But, to get back to Walter Russell and what they&#x27;re doing, they said that once they were successful in completing their plan, they were going to then announce that he [Trump] had passed away - probably in a bad way, probably in a way that would cause a civil war to erupt in the United States. But they said they have two or three other parties they are taking into account to play the role of the operatives in the eye of the public.</div>

<div class="line">Sunny: To play the role of who?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: The operatives. So you call it a president.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Sunny: Oh, okay. Yeah. So to play the role of Trump in the public?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: No. To be the next Republican Party... [nominee]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Sunny: Oh! So they would just come in and that operative would be that person.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Yeah, which is why the debate about the vice president, and who&#x27;s doing the thing for Trump. Because then they would pick that person, the running mate or whoever it is. It&#x27;s supposed to be Tulsi something (Sunny: Yeah, Tulsi Gabbard.) and then it&#x27;s somebody else. Yeah, it changes on any given day. But they&#x27;ll then take that person and then put that person in, is what they&#x27;ll do. They&#x27;ll say, oh, they&#x27;re already on the ticket, that kind of thing, if it&#x27;s that late in the game. If they manage to do it before the selections.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Sunny: But they won&#x27;t be successful.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: All in the name of the game.</div>

<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Sunny: They won&#x27;t be successful, right? So the odds of any of that, you know. So they&#x27;ll probably just stick with the Trump narrative... Cuz they&#x27;re not gonna come up with that money. They&#x27;re not gonna be able to complete their plan.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Nope.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Sunny: Yeah, so Trump it is. Yaaay!</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Oh, I don&#x27;t care [chuckle]. Yeah. Well, you know, I&#x27;m sure they wanted him to be the one to save, you know, come back in as the savior. However, you&#x27;ll be the ones on the forefront of the burning rubble - because you won&#x27;t make it four more years. You just won&#x27;t, you know, at this rate.</div>

Looking forward to ringing the excommunicado bell on Sunday. You know, I&#x27;m polishing it up now. Good luck to you [chuckle]. All right. And that is the World Situation Report, I guess, for... what day is today? Wednesday.</div>
