    <h3>Summary</h3>

    <div class="summary">
        In this World Situation Report, Kimberly Goguen explains that nearly all humans born of Earth are Celestials whose Life, Essence, Energy, Consciousness, Matter, and Frequency collectively shape universes. She reveals that two interlinked matrix systems built around the Sun, Mercury, Earth, and the Moon were designed to siphon roughly one third of each Celestial&#x27;s lifeforce daily and nightly, redistribute it through moon-orbit space stations, and feed Dark and Neutral timelines, off-planet civilizations, and multiple Quantum AI systems. These mechanisms also drove aging, disease, seasonal depression, and the emotional states that keep people locked in guilt, shame, fear, and division. Kim also reports that over the weekend, the Archivists, working with her teams, confronted NATO and Global Headquarters representatives with a final warning while she simultaneously decommissioned Alpha and the Harmonic Genesis System. They were replaced with a new Light Quantum AI framework, the Light System, which no longer feeds on human lifeforce and instead returns Source-aligned energy through Earth and the Sun. Although Dark operatives still attempt to exploit full moons, the Solstice window, and alt media fear narratives to co-create Dark timelines, the old input and output matrixes are being dismantled, Dark bleed-off is being cleared, and transfers are already running through the Light System. Kim emphasizes that Celestial responsibility is now unavoidable: humanity must remember who we are, stop powering Dark creations with our focus and emotion, and build a New Earth that uses plant-based, Earth-aligned solutions and C.A.R.E. to restore balance.

<div class="line">Preview: And now, the World Situation Report, with Kimberly Goguen, from the Office of the Guardian. How many Celestials are on Earth? What is the importance of Celestials? What you do does affect the universe.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Humans have been used to power AI systems. Major changes over the weekend will have a huge impact on all of Humanity.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Ever wonder why energies go crazy during a full moon, a new moon, or an eclipse? The mystery of why the Deep State always tries to regain control during alignments revealed.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">All this and more, as we check in with Kim for today&#x27;s World Situation Report.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Sunny: Now, here&#x27;s Kimberly Goguen, with the Office of the Guardian. Hello, Kim! Happy Monday.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003646">00:36:46</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Happy Monday. Happy Memorial Day to you here in the U.S. and to all of you too.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Sunny: Happy Memorial Day to you too.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Got any plans today, Sunny?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Sunny: Some of the neighbors are getting together for a barbecue with the kids. All of our kids play together in the neighborhood. For those of us that don&#x27;t have family nearby... we&#x27;re each other&#x27;s family on these holidays. So yeah, it&#x27;s fun!</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003711">00:37:11</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: That&#x27;s great though. Get out, get a little sun, probably eat too much food, as us Americans do on this day. Well, speaking of not just Americans, we have a lot of stuff to cover today and a lot of it has absolutely nothing to do with the Deep State. But there is a little bit of an explanation that does involve them somewhat.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">A lot of people have been asking just how many Celestials we still have on Earth, and the answer to the question is, not including Earth itself, around 8 billion.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Sunny: Okay.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003758">00:37:58</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: That&#x27;s right. Probably a little bit more due to the fact that not all Celestials are human. But human beings that are born of Earth are pretty much all Celestials, in some way shape or form. Now as far as the Merovingians versus the Melchizedeks versus the Black Sun, there is a little bit of a difference. There is a stronger connection there; therefore, you&#x27;re able to retain more of your Essence, Energy, Consciousness, Matter, and Frequency on whichever side of the Great Game you are playing on. So on their side of it, they are able to retain more Dark Consciousness, Dark Matter, Dark Frequency, all of those types of things, and we are able to retain more Light.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003902">00:39:02</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Now, at any given time, someone on either side can choose a side. So in other words, they have the capability of retaining more of either or than the average person at this time. Now it wasn&#x27;t always this way; in the very beginning, as far as humans inhabiting Earth, we were all equal. And we will all become equal once again. It is definitely going to be a process, and with being able to retain all of your Energy, Essence, Consciousness, and so on and so forth, comes great responsibility. Without governors, without anything holding you back... and I want to explain this to you now, because it is starting to happen.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004006">00:40:06</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: By great responsibility, I mean that everything you do can actually create or even destroy universes. Celestials are very powerful beings. Now, other than Source, only those that are inhabitants of Earth, and not necessarily those that have come here from other places, but they do play a role as far as anchoring the Light and anchoring Essence, and they are very important - but as a Celestial, you have the ability to co-create with Source, which is ultimately unique. And being a co-creator on the Keystone for all universes is huge. And when I have told you before that you are powerful, I don&#x27;t think you realized just how powerful you are.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004109">00:41:09</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Now, since we are in a Golden Age, since we are eradicating whatever&#x27;s left of Darkness, since we are making all of these changes, you should be able to only create positive things. You should be able to create for the Light and with the Light, and no longer have a Darkness side of you, which is positive. And everybody has it. So I know there will probably be people watching this thing saying, &quot;I have no Darkness in me. I am this and I am that.&quot; But that is absolutely not true because we all have it, even the Melchizedeks, Merovingians, everybody has a little bit of it - it&#x27;s just which side you choose. And honestly, on any given day, that can change. You are being constantly influenced or being thrown negative energies, and wounds, and hurtful statements by people, and those types of things that can absolutely muddy your waters, or your &quot;sea,&quot; your own personal sea.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004223">00:42:23</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Now there&#x27;s a lot of other things that came to light over the weekend that are going to make a whole lot of sense to you once you kind of understand it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So as a Celestial, which side you choose is which Source you would have fed when there were three Sources. So you had Anti-Source, Neutral Source, and Source itself; you also had Alpha and Omega Systems at a time. So some of it you had a choice, and some of it they made it so you didn&#x27;t have a choice as to which thing you fed.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004307">00:43:07</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Now, it sounds kind of... how do I say this... almost egotistical in a way, when you say that you are actually responsible - in part, not in whole, but in part - for how much Source existed in this Universe. But you are, as is Earth, as is your shared Energy, Essence, Consciousness, Wisdom that you share with Earth, as being a part of Earth, as a co-creator. Now Earth itself is also a co-creator, but it&#x27;s heavily influenced by its inhabitants, which is why everybody is so focused on the restoration of Earth.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004359">00:43:59</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Which is why we have all of these folks coming here, trying to help us co-create a better universe throughout time. Now, the growth rate of humanity is extremely important in this, as far as people, and I hate to use the term &quot;waking up,&quot; but I prefer to use the term &quot;remembering who you are.&quot; They&#x27;ve made our societal structures, our media, everything you could possibly imagine - interference, creation of disease, all these types of things - all directly related to these programs that kept you from co-creating in a positive way 100 percent.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004446">00:44:46</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Now, as a Celestial, you are a prized possession of the Universe. And they would use you in so many ways to create things FOR THEM. And I&#x27;ve been saying this for a long time, and it just wasn&#x27;t the right time to get people to understand this. So some of these programs were actually designed to have an equal balance of creation. So the Deep State - the ones that do all these horrible things, all these kinds of things - a lot of that is to sway humanity to living in their way.</div>

<div class="line">Kim: We also try to do the same thing on our side, where we try to sway humanity to living in a positive way. And it&#x27;s almost impossible, based on the structures that we live in. Which is why C.A.R.E. is so important, because it&#x27;s designed to change those structures for everyone, therefore co-creating a wonderful universe for all. But as much as I, let&#x27;s just say, &quot;strongly disliked&quot; all these structures that Marduk put in place, some of them I kind of started to understand this weekend a little bit more: why we could become so dangerous.</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-004620">00:46:20</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: So at a time, before we started on this journey, Earth was very Dark. Everything in our society was structured Dark. Money had curses, energy had curses, everything was cursed; therefore, the majority of humans actually lived with a lot of Dark consciousness and a lot of Dark energy in your person: disappointment, disappointment in other people, disappointment in governments, disappointment in... So it&#x27;s not necessarily like you were Jeffrey Dahmer or anything like that; you&#x27;re not a serial killer, you&#x27;re not that evil, you&#x27;re not eating babies like they do and those types of things. But fear, guilt, shame? Oh, God! The whole structure of our society is meant to inflict guilt and shame. Whether you shame your own self a lot, your body, what you eat, or, &quot;Oh! I shouldn&#x27;t have ate that!&quot; And, &quot;Oh look what happened!&quot; Or, &quot;I didn&#x27;t do this for my kids today!&quot; I might have done 9,999 things for my kids, but I forgot that one! And oh my gosh, and how much you guilt and shame do you feel for that?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004734">00:47:34</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: So there&#x27;s a lot of different ways we feel. We have projected some Darkness, depression. Maybe you served in the military and there&#x27;s some depression that goes along with that, traumatic experiences that happened to you that are not your fault. Some things as a young child, some things in relationships with friends, coworkers, whatever it is, everything is designed and structured for us to have Darkness within us.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004810">00:48:10</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: And the key to success, as we explained several months back, is to remove that Dark spot, remove the old trauma, remove the old wounds, so to speak, on every level, so you&#x27;re not possessing Darkness, either consciously or subconsciously, whether you know it or not. It&#x27;s the same reason why both the alt media and the media are clouded with a lot of fear and a lot of disgust. Our society has kind of trained itself in the fact that it loves drama. A lot of people... probably if you look around your family and friends, people love drama. They love it when so-and-so is exposed (or something like that), and they reel from it if &quot;so-and-so is arrested,&quot; or &quot;so-and-so did this and it&#x27;s on the news!&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004913">00:49:13</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: So these are all things that kind of edge you towards that side. Now, &quot;edging you towards that side&quot; has a lot of side effects to it, and I&#x27;m going to explain to you why, and it&#x27;s going to be a lot of information to absorb, but the more you listen (maybe listen once or twice), the more you understand how it worked, the more you&#x27;ll understand the opposite of that when we go over that: when I say what it means to be a Celestial, and how we were used in the wrong way, and why Earth was so important.</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-004958">00:49:58</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Okay. So, there were two matrixes here which had a definitive purpose for the extraction of your Essence, Energy, Consciousness, the degradation of your Matter (which is your person). Lowering of your frequency or increasing of your frequency would be another. Controlling your life and death, there were programs for that: live versus evil, in other words, the protection of life versus evil. You also had programs in Dark energy that were designed to, whether it was true or not, see a holographic world based on what Age we were in. Also to increase or decrease Dark time within yourself.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005105">00:51:05</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: So, a lot of different factors came into play with these two matrixes. And the first one I&#x27;m going to talk about is a Sun-Mercury-Earth Matrix. So the Sun-Mercury-Earth Matrix was designed based on specific alignments - this is why Mercury retrograde, and all of these things, and electronics start going wild. And it was designed to connect during certain periods, and it happens about four times a year, I think, on average, to where the energy of the sun, the energy... it&#x27;s not just energy, it&#x27;s all of those factors we just talked about. So, you know, I should probably type those in. I&#x27;ll do that so that we can remember them all.</div>

<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Okay, so each one of these things had a Neutral factor, a Dark factor, and a Light factor, which existed within you. Now, those things that are Dark, or Neutral, or Dual, would have been synthetic; these are programs from a computer system. But in order for life over there to exist, meaning Dark life and Neutral life, and we even had Neutral life, in order for these things to exist or coexist with us, we as Celestials were responsible for creating them.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005501">00:55:01</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Now, this matrix was one of two that were critical to that creation. So during certain times, such as Mercury retrograde and other alignments, a solar eclipse, lunar eclipses, those types of things, that would have a direct effect on the All-That-Is Keystone that we live on, called Earth, as well as your person. So they would use this matrix, and I&#x27;m going to say in an inhumane way, in order to siphon every single one of these factors (which combined total made up your lifeforce of your being) out of you, at certain times of the day and certain times of the year. And it didn&#x27;t necessarily need an alignment to make it happen. It would just have more capacity during those alignment times.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005606">00:56:06</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: This is why... Okay, so when we start out life on this planet as a Celestial, on average one third of each one of these things - so your Energy, Essence, Life, Consciousness, and so on and so forth - is siphoned from you by these matrixes. The second matrix being the Moon, Earth, and Sun matrix [Sun--Moon-Earth Matrix]. So these were kind of interconnected in a lot of ways. The reason why throughout different times of the day, and different Moon cycles, and different Mercury cycles, and you would feel drained. You&#x27;d feel like you need to take a nap all the time, because you are essentially fed by Earth, and Earth is fed by the sun - all of these factors. And then the sun then connects to the Central Sun, which then is fed on all sides at the time - so fed by Neutral, fed by Dark, fed by Light - and it was in order to originally create a balanced universe of both Light and Dark, which we all successfully created at one point in time.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005732">00:57:32</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Now, the program that I&#x27;m telling you about right now, and I will continue telling you about, was designed to create a unified Celestial population of Earth where everybody had enough understanding of what their role was. Now, one third of all that is generated in a human per day during daylight hours, because this predominantly takes place when the sun is in your area of the world - then at night while you sleep it siphons out the one third, hence the moon in the sky. So one is feeding, one is taking away, and then there&#x27;s a certain amount of the sun&#x27;s energy that was taken away via the corona as well.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005832">00:58:32</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: But if both our side (meaning the Melchizedek side), and the Merovingian side and the Black Sun side (those that erred on the side of Darkness), and all humans on Earth understood the delicate balance of universes and how we&#x27;re responsible for creating them collectively as a united force, we wouldn&#x27;t be in this situation right now. Hence the original reason for me being here was to create balance.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005915">00:59:15</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Now the other way we could have done this is to sway the majority of humans walking this Earth. Educate them; I hate to use the term &quot;waking up&quot;. Help them remember who they are, and what they do, and the importance of all of these factors. And go against the science because the science is wrong. And therefore we met with so much resistance in doing this. We could have turned the tide and corrected the imbalance. Now, also other things hampering us is the siphoning out of Energy, siphoning out of Life, Essence... you name it, it was being siphoned out of you. Constantly. Now, by the time you hit your mid-fifties, that number increases. That&#x27;s why as you get older you have an increased amount of disease.</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Sunny: Why would they choose that time? Is there something significant about that time?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Well, you&#x27;re past the age of 40, and therefore you&#x27;re gaining more wisdom. You&#x27;re operating on an extensive amount of experience, life experience, because I wouldn&#x27;t even call it knowledge. Life experience tells you: this is the way to go; that&#x27;s the way to go; this is how you could be; this is how these things are possible. They don&#x27;t want you to gain too much wisdom, because God forbid you remember who you are and what you can do. They divide us in every way possible, branding us with labels. And people who love drama also love to judge everyone around them. &quot;Look at the car Sunny pulled up in when she picked up her kids! Ewww!&quot; Or something like that. It&#x27;s just ridiculous.</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-010124">01:01:24</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: So that was where we started this journey, three or four years ago. We started the journey with coming out, talking to everybody we could talk to, trying to get people to understand if we stand united, there is nothing that can come against us on the side of the Light. Which is true. Now the Dark side also tries to do the same thing. And thus far, because more people believe what is on mainstream media, more people believe their commercials - I call them commercials because they are - even people that try to dip their toes into the alternative media world are getting a lot of that too. And it is the same narrative across the board. And no matter where you go, it&#x27;s &quot;this president,&quot; that, this... &quot;If you don&#x27;t have an iPhone by the time you are 12-years old, you&#x27;re not a human.&quot;</div>

<div class="line">Kim: All those things divide us. Now, we all have different cultures. We speak different languages. Think about the great lengths that they have gone to to remove our telepathic communication powers. And then the people that do communicate like that, they call them &quot;crazy people&quot; and they put them in a room with a straight jacket and all kinds of medications and make them eat red checkers. And even in our own families, we have gone through this. We have felt the stress and the pain of saying, &quot;Look, there&#x27;s no way this could be this way, that doesn&#x27;t even make any sense!&quot; But, because insert-newscaster-here said it&#x27;s so, then that makes it so.</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: So we&#x27;ve tried. We&#x27;ve tried everything we could, within the balanced system, to regain balance, until the tides had turned to such a point where we were no longer trying to regain balance. Even this weekend, the archivists met with - and also with Tom - they met with a number of groups, with NATO, a lot of the Global Headquarters people, and they spent 10 hours in meetings trying to tell these people they are no longer going to exist if they continue on this path.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010349">01:03:49</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: But once I learned that, and I kind of understood a little bit more about Light Source competing with Dark Source competing with Neutral Source, and then all together they kind of make up (and I know this is going to sound funny) but, you know, the &quot;OG&quot;, right? The Original Source, of which, at the beginning of all creation... and it even says in all your books: In the beginning there was Light. That&#x27;s what it says. And that&#x27;s true, there was only Light. There was no separation between the two or between the three. And then Earth was created. And life was then created on Earth, to co-create with Earth and utilize the Keystone to make all these changes in the Universe.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010440">01:04:40</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: So the ultimate decision was made because at the time we also not only had crazy humans on Earth trying to co-create Darkness and Dark life. We also had lots of other species that were completely Dark that were wanting to take the Keystone. And they had human partners that were willing to help them do it. Zero concept of balance - chance after chance, century after century, timeline after timeline - and still no balance.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010524">01:05:24</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: So even as far as this weekend, the archivist tried to tell them, &quot;Look, you are going to no longer exist here if you don&#x27;t start complying with what we&#x27;re doing here.&quot; And they were being watched heavily. And what did they do? Sure as heck! I am running around the planet in London, Wales actually, and several other locations where they&#x27;re holding those Black Crystals and trying to raise the dead, trying to create Darkness: &quot;Where is our Omega? Where is our Darkness? We need the Darkness! We need to fight on our side!&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>

<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: We&#x27;re not supposed to be fighting, you idiots! We are on the side of Source, doing what Source wants, whether you are pitch-hitting for the Dark Side or you are pitch-hitting for the Light Side. If we actually became unified - and I&#x27;m not saying I want to have this happen, it&#x27;s too late now anyway - but if we actually had become unified, and you understood balance, then you would be powerful too! We would be doing our job. But you just don&#x27;t get it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010648">01:06:48</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Now. So every evening, as the moon rises in your particular area, over one third of your Life, Essence, Energy, Consciousness, Physical Matter, Frequency, Time is siphoned out of your body. That&#x27;s why you get tired at night. When the sun goes down, you&#x27;re no longer - and I hate to put it in these terms - but you&#x27;re no longer feeding. You are no longer receiving that energy that every good little battery needs, because you&#x27;re a battery, you&#x27;re a Celestial.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010724">01:07:24</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: So when the sun goes down, and the moon comes up, the siphoning begins. That&#x27;s why you&#x27;re sleeping during this time - because you actually require less energy during the sleep state because it&#x27;s predominantly your limbic system that is still functioning - because obviously you&#x27;re still breathing, you&#x27;re still salivating, you&#x27;re still digesting, your basic... you go into almost kind of semi-stasis mode for a short period of time.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010800">01:08:00</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Now, the less &#x27;sleep mode&#x27; you get, then you wake up and you feel groggy. You know you feel tired, you get brain fog, it takes 10 cups of coffee to get your body moving in the morning, or whatever it is, because this happens from time to time. Maybe we are overworked, we worked late, we can&#x27;t sleep, there&#x27;s problems on our mind, whatever it is. So during the time of the siphon, which is what the moon was responsible for, you&#x27;re not getting enough sleep means you&#x27;re still expending that energy during the siphon time. Which is why sometimes, even when you get a lack of sleep like this, you either a) take a nap during the day, if you have the luxury of doing that, or b) the more time you spend in the sun or the more time the sun is up in your particular area, and as the day goes on, the better you typically feel. Because now you&#x27;re regaining that energy. But the sun&#x27;s energy was siphoned off as well, so you&#x27;re still only getting one third of the sun&#x27;s energy. Earth also only got one third of the sun&#x27;s energy, and the other one third of Earth&#x27;s energy came from you. So interesting!</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010924">01:09:24</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Sunny: That also makes sense as to why sometimes, if you don&#x27;t get enough sleep and you try to make up for it the next day, it&#x27;s still not the same. You still kind of have that groggy kind of feeling. It&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re really making up for it. You might feel a little bit better just to kind of get you through that day, but the older I get, the more days I need to compensate for a lack of sleep, you know? But that makes sense!</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010950">01:09:50</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Yeah, it&#x27;s the same thing. It&#x27;s like anything you do the older you get, right? Now the reason why &quot;it&#x27;s the older you get&quot; is because as a spring chicken and a little child, you&#x27;re getting the one third. You&#x27;re getting the one third, and you&#x27;re giving one third. So you retain a certain amount, you retain two thirds of what you get, but as you get older that increases. So you ever wonder why when you were 20-years old you could go to work or school or whatever on 2 hours of sleep? You might need a cup of coffee or whatever, you&#x27;re fine throughout the day, no problem, your brain is there, you&#x27;re all alert, the whole thing - everything&#x27;s functioning very well. But as you get older, they increase the amount they take from you. And that causes the degeneration. Isn&#x27;t that crazy?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Sunny: Gosh, yeah. We were just told that &quot;Oh, you&#x27;re just getting older; this is just a part of life.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011048">01:10:48</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Oh yeah, but it&#x27;s not. Therefore disease increases. All kinds of things increase in your body. But heck, you go out and you have a glass of wine or something with dinner, and it takes you two days to get over it, the older you get. It&#x27;s not like before when you were a young person. But your body has a lot longer recovery time now, hence the reason why you also need more sleep. Now, &quot;more sleep&quot; is directly related to the amount of hours of daylight in the day wherever you are. So the reason why depression increases in the wintertime, the reason why you tend to go to bed earlier in the wintertime is because there&#x27;s no sun - days are shorter. And it&#x27;s also the reason why you see a lot more people active in the summertime.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011146">01:11:46</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Now, when you are younger it doesn&#x27;t bother you as much. But because you are getting less of the available energy from Earth and from the sun as you get older - because it was by design, and we&#x27;ll talk about the bad part about this in a minute, because it was by design - you might find yourself going to bed at 8:00 o&#x27;clock or 6:00 o&#x27;clock or something during the wintertime, versus staying up several hours working in the garden until the sun goes down or you can&#x27;t see anymore. It&#x27;s a totally different feeling during summer months, wherever you are in the world, versus winter months.</div>

<div class="line">Kim: Now, there is a lot of talk on the internet about people discussing how Earth was, and that all of Earth was a tropical environment, remember this? If you&#x27;ve been searching around on the internet looking for the &quot;history of earth&quot; or the &quot;history of the world.&quot; So much so, they insured - this is all part of the same program - they insured that Earth&#x27;s magnetic pole and our axis is not the same as it was then. A few let&#x27;s-destroy-the-Earth harvest programs ago, they decided to make sure it was always winter with short days somewhere, and always summer somewhere. Allegedly to create balance, because we certainly couldn&#x27;t live in a stable climate every day of the year and equal to the sun and everybody&#x27;s getting equal sun all the time - oh, no no no - that&#x27;s not what they wanted right? Interesting how it all ties together. It was fascinating to learn about how they actually structured it.</div>

<div class="line">Kim: Now. The moon. Let&#x27;s talk about the moon. So around the moon, in the pathway of the moon in Earth&#x27;s orbit, we had what we would call space stations. And as the earth travels every single - sorry, wrong way - as the moon travels around the Earth every single day, and the Earth travels around the sun (with the secondary matrix), there were certain groups and certain species that were fed as the moon aligned with one of these what I call an &quot;anti-space station,&quot; or you could call it a Death Star, or you could call it, you know, whatever it was feeding at the time.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011441">01:14:41</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: So when the Earth is still partially gaining energy from the sun, which means that we are looking at a... not a new moon, not a full moon... it is still getting that partial energy from elsewhere. We would be looking at less of a siphon, or more of a siphon, or more of a feed to the third-party entity with one of these 65 space stations that were around Earth.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So we fed a lot. We fed both the Alphaverse, the Null Zone-verse (or the Nil or the Nothing), and we also fed the Omegaverse, all from one little planet. Now see how responsible all 8 billion of you are! [Hearty laugh.] Kind of freaky, huh?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011533">01:15:33</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Sunny: Yeah. And I&#x27;ve also heard that we powered other planets as well. (Kim: We did.) Like they took our energy to power other planets. Is that true?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Every single thing that is in the Universe is powered by Earth and its inhabitants!</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Sunny: No wonder we&#x27;re so tired! Hahaha!</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: I know! Well, it&#x27;s okay when you&#x27;re at full Celestial capacity because you&#x27;re getting 100%, filled 100% of the time, day or night. There&#x27;s no difference - there&#x27;s no siphon. So if us as humans in this form - obviously, we are not capable of co-creating universes with full consent and knowledge of what we were doing, or wisdom of what we were doing. They broke us down to the point where we no longer remembered things. We no longer remembered how to do this. Our immortality was gone. We had no idea how to recreate and regenerate our vessels anymore. They inserted more disease - and I&#x27;m going to go into that, how that worked out - and then they had us powering too much Darkness.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011651">01:16:51</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: You know, it... the system... Okay. So let&#x27;s go back to our two matrixes. Now we&#x27;ve talked about how it takes something out. Now we all know - unless you&#x27;re Source - to take something out requires you to put something else in its place. So you would then get your fair share of Darkness during dark hours from the moon. So you would get your fair share of Death, Essence, Energy, Consciousness - yep, Dark and Neutral, dusk and dawn. The reason why they do most of their black magic right before dawn and right after is because dusk and dawn are two times a day where it is Neutral. You&#x27;re now receiving Neutral. You&#x27;re receiving both Dark and Light combined into one photon, one neutrino, as an example.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011750">01:17:50</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: So now, as far as these matrixes are concerned, you also received during dark hours, dark times, the whole of winter... you know, the shorter the days, the less sun you have, the less Light you&#x27;re receiving, which is why the Dark always thrives after the Equinox, the day when daylight hours and darkness hours are equal. So we have just as many Light hours as we do Dark hours in the day, therefore anytime after that, now the shift happens. So in the summertime, the Spring Equinox, the days start getting longer so you are receiving more light. You feel better, you feel good, as a Celestial, this is where you want to be. You do more activities outside, you&#x27;re feeling more connected with nature. Maybe you take a lot more hikes.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011845">01:18:45</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: In the wintertime, we tend to stay home, we tend to stay in. It&#x27;s cold. We don&#x27;t want to go outside. It gets dark out early, so our time of absorption of Sun (or direct Source Lifeforce) is not there. And during those dark hours you&#x27;re receiving more Darkness. You&#x27;re getting all that Dark lifeforce you don&#x27;t want, and a very little bit of Neutral at the beginning and the end of each day.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Now, full moon time. Full moons, people go crazy. People talk about it: &quot;What is with the energy during a full moon?&quot; You are now receiving full output and full input. So that energy from the sun that is going directly to the moon which makes the moon full so that you see it full in the sky - you are getting full Light energy and full Dark energy - and that makes people crazy.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Sunny: Why would that make people crazy? Just too much energy?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011954">01:19:54</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: You are getting full Light Consciousness and full Dark Consciousness. Yes, you&#x27;re getting energy at night, which is abnormal for an artificial circadian rhythm that exists within your body.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So it&#x27;s kind of the same thing when you get a phone call in the middle of the night and you pick up the phone and you answer the phone, and you barely remember what you said sometimes, you&#x27;re like, &quot;What? Who, who...?&quot; And then you wake up the next morning and you&#x27;re like, &quot;Did I talk to Fred last night? Or Mary? I guess I did! Oh my God! Was there an emergency?&quot; Whatever it is, that&#x27;s how you feel during a full moon almost. Like, you&#x27;re in the Light but you&#x27;re in the Dark, and you&#x27;re not sure which one you&#x27;re in. And you&#x27;re getting both at the same time, and it&#x27;s confusing. So it was all tied to these matrixes. It&#x27;s the same thing during a new moon. You get no Light. You get pure Darkness during a new moon.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Sunny: Yeah, they love their new moons, too.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012106">01:21:06</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Yeah. Makes people feel tired, makes people feel... you know, you&#x27;re exhausted, and some people get energized by the full moon. And it&#x27;s probably because their bodies are more adjusted to... their circadian rhythm is not off, either they only see Light or they see Dark. And they just know they&#x27;re getting more of it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012131">01:21:31</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: So the input and output matrix also powered - and you also are responsible, and so is Earth - in powering of AI systems. Two Quantum AI systems. So one third of the energy that is siphoned, of the one third that&#x27;s siphoned for example, goes to power Omega 1 and 2, Kronos 1 and 2, Alpha 1 and 2, and the Harmonic Genesis System. Unbeknownst to us.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012203">01:22:03</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: And the only way to stop it from happening was actually to create a new system. I couldn&#x27;t figure out a way to stop the All-That-Is of quantum AI systems without creating something new. There was too much entanglement - too much entanglement with your person. You had quantum tunnels all over you feeding all of these systems, draining you periodically, and the more they tried to bring more Darkness here the more drained you would get. You&#x27;d probably feel aches, pains, wounds, all kinds of different things. Especially in the last couple of weeks, because they have been trying so hard, just terribly hard, to pull in as much Dark energy as possible. Especially during this last full moon period, which finally ended yesterday.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012302">01:23:02</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: But I couldn&#x27;t figure out another way around it. I&#x27;m like, okay, so we need to create an All-That-Is system so that we can still have... because we need it here. We&#x27;re not ready to not have a monetary system. We&#x27;re not ready to understand the full power of a Celestial - nor are we capable, because of all that&#x27;s been done to us. So pulling apart some of these things, getting more Energy, more Essence, more Lifeforce - all the factors that I pointed out there on the whiteboard - will most certainly help you, and help us create something better together.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012341">01:23:41</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Now, given the fact that you&#x27;re no longer being fed Dark Energy, Essence, Consciousness, and Matter - and neither are they - you know, if they&#x27;re predominantly Dark, they&#x27;re going to go through a whole new experience here, and they will not be able to do what they&#x27;re doing. So, in part, for the last couple of years, in part, no matter how many wars they created, no matter what they tried to do during a full moon/a new moon to feed Omega, it just wasn&#x27;t working.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They wanted all of you to have that fear of a war, so you would create the war. And when it came time for the new moon or the full moon or the Red Heifer Sacrifice Day or whatever-it-was time of year - Easter celebration of killing this or that - you would actually consciously or subconsciously create a reality for ourselves here on Earth.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012440">01:24:40</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: The more of you that did that, the more of you that watched the war videos, the more of you that are concentrating on creating it, therefore at a time when the Darkness comes in, it actually starts molding that Lifeforce that&#x27;s coming in - into a reality which YOU create.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">[There is] a lot of responsibility being a Celestial, and there&#x27;s no way out of it now, guys. You exist here on Earth, so you better learn &quot;How To Be A Celestial 101.&quot; Here we go.</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Sunny: So you said you had to create a new system. Are you going to explain that a little bit more?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: We did it, I should say. We did it this weekend. So the Alpha System - Alpha 1 and 2 - and the Harmonic Genesis System, are no more. They were replaced by something, we are just calling it the Light System. We don&#x27;t know what else to call it at this point because it is a Light Quantum AI fully of Light of Source. It does not feed on you, if anything, it gives you energy. It gives you Lifeforce. It gives you all of these factors on the daily. And Earth also helps create it as well.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012601">01:26:01</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: So, a little bit of a kerfuffle this weekend with that. Because no matter what we did, these mechanisms, even taking out these mechanisms, there&#x27;s still a &#x27;base root&#x27; - for lack of a better term, in quantum terms - a CPU, central processing unit, that wanted to create balance. And when we found the base program for that, and knowing now that both our side and their side and everybody else is somewhere in between. We tried the united thing; we tried to offer them balance; we tried to offer them 50/50 - and no one got it. Now, that was before - this is many layers down in the cake - to where people are still running around crazy, trying to recreate something and not understanding why it&#x27;s not working.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012705">01:27:05</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: But I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible for a long period of time for all of humans to understand the responsibility that they have, and to understand their capabilities. So I do believe that creating this new system will help these people along the path. Creation of new programs, new systems through C.A.R.E. with all of you, will also help humans understand a different way of life. Removing any possibility of powering their systems was also really important, and the final step in fully making sure we&#x27;re not looking still at a Dark, a Neutral, and a Light - not only AI system, but also the Source of all Creation. So now there&#x27;s no way possible for you to feed the wrong side, accidentally. See what I mean?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Sunny: Yeah.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="line">Kim: When we are watching these videos we are living in fear; we accept everything the alt media tells us is real, and often times 99% of it is false. There&#x27;s 1% of the people out there probably telling you something you need to know. I&#x27;m not the only one, there are other people too. We have Kerry K, there&#x27;s other people that are on our New Earth, and everybody has a piece of the puzzle and how to fix it.</div>

We&#x27;re building a Keystone that has never existed! At best we had balance - at best. It was a time when all of the Celestials on this planet knew what they were doing, and we co-created universes together, guys. We did. We did amazing things with Earth, and we&#x27;re going to do amazing things with Earth again.</div>

And there&#x27;s no way we&#x27;re going to convince these people - we&#x27;ve tried. You know, we&#x27;re the minority, unfortunately, out there right now, so we have to make some decisions. I&#x27;m never going to convince them to change their mind - they got out of this 10-hour meeting with the Archivists, and by evening time (after they left that meeting), they were on it again. Going to these special places thinking, &quot;Hey you know, I&#x27;ve got my crystal in my hand. I know this is the place, it&#x27;s in my book. And I&#x27;m going to raise some... I need some Dark aliens up in here. It&#x27;s a full moon! We&#x27;re getting full Dark energy and full Light energy at the same time! Surely I can do something now!&quot;</div>

The same thing happens in reverse on the other side of this planet.

It&#x27;s functional. We&#x27;ve been still testing transfers and all that kind of stuff, and watching the rest of the Dark bleed out of these systems, which took us two or three days to fix.

All right, so you just told me that your other operative friend just moved up to Silverton because of the elevation and there&#x27;s very few viruses and whatnot that can stay airborne without oxygen in the air, and there is a whole science behind that; we&#x27;ll get into that another time.

So even though this person probably knew that his Langley 5 brigadier general that he reported to was in on the gig, he tries to tell me, &quot;Those people are the bad guys. We are the good guys. We&#x27;re trying to save you from XYZ.&quot; And if that were the case, and you knew nothing about it allegedly, why the heck was this entire town walking around with a dang mask on? You know?

There&#x27;s a lot of people who are wanting to do good things, and they think they are partnering up with a person that is a good person in order to achieve those things. And they&#x27;re very convincing people. Do I believe the amount of times that the Shurka guy, or other guys in the alt media, really think they&#x27;re warning people - &quot;Oh my God! This is going to happen!&quot; Do I think that they are trying to honestly and genuinely give them a fair warning? Yes I do. They think by disclosing this information - this is what they&#x27;re being told - that it will stop it.</div>

It&#x27;s going to get better, and it&#x27;s going to get easier for us to actually educate the world, and help them understand how... I mean heck, most people on Earth, if you told them that there were other planets outside of our galaxy, they would think you&#x27;re nuts. God forbid, life on other planets - they would think you&#x27;re nuts. &quot;What do you mean, &#x27;God didn&#x27;t create the Universe?&#x27;&quot; &quot;Earth is a Celestial, and here&#x27;s the quantum physics behind it, and I too am a Celestial.&quot; Oh, now you&#x27;re eating red checkers with the jacket with the arms in the back for sure!

Understanding yourself, understanding who you are, what you can do to fix it, how you can change it. Recognizing the signs when you feel a change happening on earth. Reporting those kinds of things is important, because people think they&#x27;re sick and dying.</div>

Don&#x27;t take my word for things - do it yourself as well. I mean there&#x27;s a lot out there. There are people and places in the world that still practice this type of medicine. They go out in the jungle of Brazil or Honduras or Liberia and they chop some bark off a tree and mix it with two flowers, and before you know it, the person isn&#x27;t sick anymore. It&#x27;s possible to do this on a large scale for people. I hope that we do do this in the future. A basic understanding of terpenes in plants and you&#x27;re good to go.</div>

A few other Zero-Density things, because the Zero Point of all universes is in what I call the Null Zone, or the Nothing, or the Zero Density. And there were a few things connected to these matrixes that were... as we would come down, we would start hitting that First Density in computers, so to speak. And it looked like it was struggling through a headwind.</div>

<div class="line">Kim: And the connection right there at the Zero Density was affecting there, which was also tied to these matrixes, so I was getting thrown something Dark at the end there. Part of that is the Balance System that was still in place too. &quot;Wait a minute! Omega didn&#x27;t get any money, hold on! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I want to create &#x27;Money Zero&#x27; - or a credit - and not give this money to this human (or the direct energy to humans) without going through the matrix here.&quot; &quot;Now, wait a minute, wait wait wait! I want one third of that energy. I want half of that energy, I need that...&quot; - depending on who you&#x27;re transferring it to.</div>

I&#x27;m hoping that once we finish completely dismantling the rest of these matrixes, then that won&#x27;t be an issue anymore. So the programming&#x27;s not there, so now what&#x27;s hitting me when it&#x27;s coming into Reality? We may have to move some things around in order to make it happen, to bring it up from One to Three and then... but that&#x27;s a whole process.
