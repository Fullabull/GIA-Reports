<div class="line">TEASER:</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s the 20th of November, 2024, coming up on today&#x27;s Global Intelligence Agency Operations Report. Battleground Earth&#x27;s stage was set over the weekend, but by who? And it wasn&#x27;t the Deep State, but they were ready to welcome some help. And the confusion about the financial system and control continues as Deep State members go on a wild goose chase. Who were the Chinese Elders, the Rothschilds, the Black Sun, the Trustees, and why was the system set up in the first place? And the mutiny is in full force as orders traveling down the ranks are being rejected worldwide.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">00:45</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Good evening, good morning, and good afternoon. It is the 20th of November. I can&#x27;t believe that. And this year is almost over. This is the Global Intelligence Agency Operations Report. It was a pretty crazy weekend, and it continued on through today. But we did have some revelations and some Revelations. But we had some interesting things come up, and we finally think we might have gotten to the bottom of things today as to why we&#x27;re having such a problem getting rid of this hologram. So, lots of good things to cover, and let&#x27;s start out with the crazy over the weekend.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">01:28</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So Saturday and Sunday it seemed like the Deep State, or a lot of the SSP members, were getting into position. They went to several different locations around the world, and it seemed like they were waiting for something. And this was kind of interesting. I&#x27;m not sure. I think I&#x27;m pretty much about 90-something odd percent sure that a lot of this that was taking place over the weekend was standing orders. And what standing orders are, it&#x27;s when there&#x27;s some space junk that was put here by some non-humans that was set to trigger off at a certain point, not necessarily in time, but as the Light becomes greater and greater here, and there&#x27;s not a whole lot of Dark energy. It&#x27;s staged to create a lot of chaos amongst humans and a lot of fear, which of course produces that Dark energy all unto itself. And this one was a pretty big one, I&#x27;m not going to lie. And when I say that it looked like we had some revelations, well, the first set of revelations actually looked like the Revelations from the Bible. And it took me a little bit to figure out what was happening because it&#x27;s a little bit different than it was explained in the books.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">02:53</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So what we had, the first set of locations that we had discovered, was a lot of really negative frequencies and electromagnetic pulse-type weaponry - scalar weapons - coming from several locations in the world. And these locations were Detroit, underneath the Guardian Building; Chicago, underneath the Sears Tower; Los Angeles, at the Tar Pits, or just outside of LA; Houston, at the NASA site. Remember &quot;Houston, we have a problem?&quot; Seattle underneath the Needle. Albuquerque underneath Black Mountain. Phoenix, Arizona, underneath Camelback Mountain; Miami, underneath the Freedom Tower; and in San Francisco, underneath the Golden Gate Bridge.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">03:54</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">What we found at the time that was interesting was it all seemed to be around very annoying frequencies, very loud noises potentially, that type of thing. Well, apparently, after further research, this turns out to be your trumpets, your trumpet version in the Bible. Then we went on from there to the bowl locations, the pouring out of the bowls. [laughing] I laugh because they always seem to tell us what they plan on doing, and I&#x27;m not necessarily talking about the Deep State even. I&#x27;m talking about what the non-humans had planted here on this planet for such a time.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">04:44</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So next, the bowl locations, or wrath, the quote-unquote &quot;wrath of God&quot; that was supposed to happen, would have been underneath Washington, D.C., Bern, Switzerland, and right underneath the child-eater statue, and you can look that up. Bangkok, underneath the giant five-and-a-half-ton gold Buddha; Belarus, underneath the Stalin Line; Wuhan, underneath the Yellow Crane Tower; Beijing, underneath the Forbidden City; Cairo, Egypt, underneath the Citadel of Saladin; Tokyo, Japan, underneath the Edo Castle Ruins - &quot;E-D-O;&quot; and in Istanbul, under the Hagia Sophia Mosque and Cathedral.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">05:32</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So that was our next set of things that were due to come off. And they were pretty tumultuous - it would have used earthquakes, the whole thing, pretty much everything you read in The Book that they warned us about ahead of time. And then from there, we went to the quote-unquote &quot;Fall of Babylon&quot; site, which, believe it or not, would have been in Moscow, Russia, underneath Red Square. There were some definite triggers there that would have - if it was still in place - would have broken down the overlay over the Gate to Source, which I&#x27;ve told you quite a while ago is underneath Moscow, underneath Red Square.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">06:19</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Next, &quot;The Beast&quot; [laughing] was due to rise from Bogota, Colombia, underneath the Montserrat Sanctuary - this is really interesting. And the quote-unquote &quot;False Prophet,&quot; or a frequency of untruth, which is what was supposed to come out of here, was in the Congo Basin on the African continent. It&#x27;s quite a large basin. Then we went to the SEAL locations, which would have been the unsealing, I guess, of what you would call in the Bible, the Devil, Satan locations. This would have been in Pakistan under the Lahore Fort. Next would have been Tehran under the Asadi Tower. Dhaka in Bangladesh, underneath the Pink Palace. In Nigeria, in Lagos, I&#x27;m not even going to try to pronounce this, but it&#x27;s the Osun-Osobo Sacred Grove. I&#x27;ll spell that for you in case you want to look it up. It&#x27;s the O-S-U-N hyphen O-S-O-G-B-O Sacred Grove. And in South Sudan, it would have been the Al-Mahedi Tomb in Sao Paulo, Brazil. It would have been the Basilica de Penha Church in Baghdad, Iraq. It was the Martyr Monument. Buenos Aires, Argentina, under the Obelisco. And in Santiago, Chile, under the sanctuary on San Cristobal Hill.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">07:54</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So like I said, it was pretty busy in all of these locations, and several others we&#x27;re going to talk about here in just a minute, that you would have found the Deep State. And they were sitting there at the ready, waiting for these things to go off, thinking that somehow it would have given them access to an AI system, and what they were discussing in particular was access to the financial system and some control. I&#x27;m not sure how the &quot;wrath of God&quot; translates to money to these people, but that&#x27;s what they believe.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">08:34</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So again, it was just a bunch of cleaning of space junk that was put there by somebody else to create a worldwide mass hysteria of all of these events that would have taken place, which would not have led to the second coming of Christ, I can tell you that, the way that it was set up, in any way, shape, or form. But it would have led to something else, which would have been kind of the opposite.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">09:07</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So as we&#x27;ve gone on this journey of cleaning up space junk and trying to get rid of the hologram, I believe I had mentioned to you a couple of weeks ago about the fact we had these bubbles within the hologram. You could call them areas where the actual beings or people, in some cases people, in some cases it was not people, were located, and they were living almost on an island unto themselves. You can think of it like living in a snow globe kind of thing, and they were officially outside of the hologram. We discovered today more of those locations of these bubbles and something interesting connected to a few of them. Most of these particular ones we discovered today, unlike on Monday, I think it was, or over the weekend - the ones we found today were actually inhabited in part by Secret Space Program operatives. And I found that pretty interesting.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">10:21</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But it&#x27;s like living in a time of no time. We can pick up on the frequency that there&#x27;s something there, but you can&#x27;t quite see it unless you know what you&#x27;re looking for. So the first time we found some things over the last few days, those were detected almost by default by something else we had taken out in &quot;the onion,&quot; so to speak, the layers of the onion as we peel them away. And once we figured out what we were looking for, the second round today was much easier to find.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">11:02</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, were they actually inhabited by Secret Space Program people? Yes and no. What apparently the Secret Space Program has been doing for a few thousand years - obviously with the aid of non-humans - is they had figured out a way to split their consciousness between themselves and multiple clones. Now, some of these people existed in alternative timelines, other than the one that we are presently in - in the past, when we had multiple timelines. And they would put them in those timelines at different points in history where their Looking-Glass-type technology would tell them that there was going to be a significant change, which could have brought us out of a Dark Age, which could have brought us out of, I would say, out from underneath their thumb, and the people they reported to - or non-people; the people or non-people that they reported to - out from underneath their thumb. And so they inserted their alternative selves to the tune of about 30,000 into these different places in history. Well, what turned out was that the ones that had already been released from these bubble cities, so to speak, had then, at the time when all our timelines merged into the one we&#x27;re living in now, in the forever time, I should say, or lack thereof, or crystalline time, now they were kind of overlapping.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">12:48</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So they may have inserted, for example, one of their clones into the year 2024 to show up in May. And this might have taken place a few months ago. So now what you have is multiple... I would say clones... of the same human running around all together on the same planet, which isn&#x27;t supposed to happen, because if they do happen to run into each other, there&#x27;s a whole reaction that takes place, and it can definitely kill them all. And I quite frankly, if there are any left, I do hope they all run into each other.</div>

<div class="line">Some of them did take refuge in these separate, I guess you would call them &quot;bubble cities,&quot; or cities outside the hologram-type locations. And that was probably good for the other ones that are still running around because now there isn&#x27;t a chance of them accidentally running into each other. Bad for us, I suppose, good for them. Now if the original human dies, then all of the other clones die as well. So it&#x27;s only a partial split; it&#x27;s not really a soul split. It&#x27;s more of just a consciousness split, where you have multiple people running around in different points in time with the same consciousness, if that makes any sense.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">14:25</div>

<div class="line">This privilege was given to the Secret Space Program operatives only. And it&#x27;s been happening for decades - or actually more than a couple thousand years, as we can tell, probably about 2,500 years this has been going on. Because some of these Secret Space Program operatives and the program itself is much, much older than our history tells us. Our history tells us that the Secret Space Program started in the 1940s and Project Blue Beam, and that&#x27;s all everybody talks about and that&#x27;s all everybody knows. But in reality the program is much older. It goes back 5,000 years or 6,000 years or even more with the utilization of humans participating in the program. So not just operatives, you also had scientists and others. And they did have access to - when it was permitted by the controllers of this planet - to jump. Meaning they could produce these clones, and then they would jump into future points in time in history or in the future. They could even go back in the past.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">15:43</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">There are rules to the game, though, as far as what they can and cannot do and how much interference they can and cannot have. And did they ever violate those rules? Well, who was running the rules of the game at the time? At least as it relates to here on Earth. They traveled only through - and I say only - through the nodes of the Omega system itself. They did not actually travel through natural means of time travel. They were too dark to do that. So if Omega didn&#x27;t have the node system and permissible travel and communication lines back and forth, so they did have a way to connect to their consciousness elsewhere in other timelines, or even in the future, or in the past, to warn them, to give them dates of possible changes. You know, &quot;You might see this coming up in six months from now,&quot; because this person was inserted two years from now. They would see these different times and events, which did explain some things to us, which was, &quot;How are they getting the information on these [dates]?... 11/11/2022... &quot;How do they know to be in these locations?&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">17:08</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, their future selves would tell them [chuckling], I guess you would say. Well, we don&#x27;t have their future selves anymore. We don&#x27;t have some others that squeaked through into these pockets either, because of the first thing that we found over the weekend. Now we know how to detect these situations as they arise, not only on Earth, but also in Andromeda and in Alpha Draconis and Aldebaran and in other places throughout the Universe where they are in a time of no time. It&#x27;s almost like a protected, cloaked shelter, so to speak.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">17:53</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But now we have the detection ability to figure out where those things are, and we did. But our first lesson in detecting these little sanctuary cities, so to speak, was over the weekend. Well, actually this one here was on Monday. And what was contained in these little pockets of &quot;no time&quot; here on Earth was what you would call an army of AI-generated demons, I guess you would say. And they were prompted by those others that were living outside in various control and command centers, which we also located today. So these particular locations on Earth were due to burst the bubble, so to speak, and release all of these, what people would have perceived as demons, out onto the planet.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">18:56</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So it was a little bit of a mess on Monday. That&#x27;s why I wasn&#x27;t on this report, but I&#x27;ll give you those locations. And each group of AI-generated demons were meant to counteract various things that we know as existence. So the first pocket was found in Liechtenstein in the Augstenberg Mountain Peak, and they were designed to promote anti-Life on Earth. So yeah, death, I guess you would say, to all of us. That was their job. Anti-Live, which is not quite the same thing as &quot;life&quot; per se, was actually underneath the entire city of London. Anti-Light beings were actually underneath the entire city of Paris. Anti-Essence would have been in Sochi, Russia, underneath the Olympic Stadium.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">19:59</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You wonder why they build these things in certain locations. Interesting. Anti-Consciousness was actually in Transylvania, in the Bonn Castle. Anti-Frequency would have been in, well, we said Ceylon, which is the old name for Sri Lanka, underneath the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic. An interesting place. Anti-Matter would have been in Mali and Timbuktu. Anti-Wisdom would have been under Auschwitz in Poland. Anti-Love would have been under the Vatican in Rome. Well, that&#x27;s no surprise there, I&#x27;m sure, to many of you listening. Anti-Time would have been under Barcelona, Spain - yes, the entire city. The Anti-Ages, or Dark Ages as we know them, would have been under Athens in Greece, underneath a plateau there. And Anti-Soul would have actually been in Seoul, South Korea. Anti-Ether would have been under Oslo in Norway. Anti-Emotional, which means negative emotion, would have been under Shanghai in China. Anti-Mental, or not so much a lack of thought in this case, but it would have promoted things like anger and that type of thing, would have been in New York City. Let&#x27;s call it the &quot;No Joy Program.&quot; Anti-Causal would have been in - I&#x27;m going to try to pronounce this - Pitigliano, Italy, near Tuscany. Anti-Astral would have been under Lake Titicaca in Bolivia. The Anti-Physical, or harm to your personal vessel, that legion of anti-beings, I guess you would say, would have been in the Philippines, the entire country. The Anti-Supernal plane of existence would have been initiated under Japan. Anti-Optimal would have been in Mongolia. And the Anti-Zero Density, or Zero Point of the Universe, which would have opened the gateway to the Omega, would have been in Australia, in the Four Corners area.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">22:24</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, lots of locations, lots happening over the weekend, but all in all, at this moment in time, after today&#x27;s work and finding the SSP&#x27;s cloning program and other things that they had planned, and the limited amount of control they had over our current environment, I would say that things are fairly stable at the moment. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re going to have Revelations, sorry, at least not at this time. And we definitely would not have ended - it was the positive event as The Book tells us.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">23:07</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So onward and upward from there, there are also a lot of other things going on. There was a visit over the weekend by Lloyd, the Secretary of Defense here in the U.S., to meet with Bongbong [Ferdinand Marcos Jr] over in the Philippines. The reason for the meeting could have been in part about what was supposed to happen in the Philippines, but it also could have been - and was - the topic of discussion while he was there, which was more about access to Philippine Elders and Asian Elders and bunkers and trustees. There seems to be a whole matrix of confusion as it relates to Deep State folks and this wild goose chase that keeps going on in Switzerland and Philippines, Philippines, Philippines; the Elders of China; the Black Dragon in Japan; the False Emperor of Japan; and all these groups of people. The Rothschild Family - there are even some members of governments that believe the Rothschild Family can still perform. Also, the same thing happens in Iran. And it&#x27;s all about access to not only money but also gold and other assets.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">24:30</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">We discussed in the GIA report last week about why hunting down Elders is not going to provide you with enough gold to support an entire worldwide financial system. And some other glitches that could possibly get in their way. And are they prepared, and definitely not with blockchain technologies - even SuperNAP, which is the NSA&#x27;s baby there, to actually create a financial system that will function and be stable? I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re probably not concerned about stable; the only thing they&#x27;re concerned about is control. And I proved my point over on Monday as well about that very same thing, so talk about that in a second.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">25:21</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But I thought I would take a few moments because there seems to be a lot of confusion out there, not only with the Deep State, not only with governments worldwide, because there are a lot of decent people in the militaries and that kind of thing that are getting very confused as well, not only in the U.S., but in other countries. But in addition to that, we see a lot of things on the Internet. NESARA/GESARA is one. The Chinese elders are going to release NESARA/GESARA. They&#x27;re going to release the revaluation of currencies. And this is causing a lot of people harm, meaning they write checks or charge things on their credit cards they wouldn&#x27;t normally charge. They&#x27;ve been traveling to Reno, God knows how many times. There&#x27;s probably still people sleeping and living in the Reno parking lot waiting for this RV to happen. Everybody&#x27;s waiting for the 800 numbers. And not only is it financially taxing when they think something is going to arrive that doesn&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s also emotionally taxing and physically taxing when it doesn&#x27;t actually happen.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">26:34</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And it&#x27;s kind of like riding this emotional roller coaster where, you know, the carrot is so big, I could do so many good things. A lot of people want to do really good things for themselves and for their family with this money, and they can buy another car or stop living in their car. So I thought I&#x27;d take a few moments to explain what that&#x27;s about. And why the trustee system was created in the first place, who created it, and how much control did they really have? And could - because I&#x27;ve said it many times - I&#x27;ve said, &quot;Look, I don&#x27;t think NESARA/GESARA is going to happen. It&#x27;s not economically possible. It would destabilize the system.&quot; But I&#x27;ve never really gone into why the people that are supposed to start NESARA/GESARA can&#x27;t do it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">27:27</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So let&#x27;s bring up the whiteboard real quick, and we&#x27;ll start to decipher this little riddle, based on my knowledge. Sorry, I wanted to get a little sip of tea there. This is my favorite ginger. Okay, the financial system. Okay. Pretty much it&#x27;s all about these bunkers. So the things that everybody&#x27;s looking for is they believe that all of these people in these different groups and different families have bunkers. And these bunkers, allegedly, and you&#x27;ve heard about the Neil Keenan stories, they have bunkers and bunkers of gold in Indonesia, you know, Suwarno/Sakorno, and all those folks and that kind of thing. And you&#x27;re hearing about other people saying, &quot;There&#x27;s a billion metric tons of gold in the Philippines,&quot; and &quot;China has all the gold in the world,&quot; and there&#x27;s all this, &quot;Fort Knox, the gold is missing! Where is it really?&quot; And some of that Fort Knox thing is kind of true.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">28:40</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So there&#x27;s bunkers; everybody&#x27;s looking for gold. Everybody wants gold from these people because they would like to control all the gold. Same thing in North Korea; why there&#x27;s always been problems with North Korea is because they believe that there is a tremendous amount of gold stored there that was then credited to the South Korean banking system. And then from there on out, there were various deals made with U.S. presidents over the years where, you know, because the Federal Reserve was kind of the world&#x27;s center, financial center, for many, many years, a lot of that stuff was registered to the Fed. So you see things like these Fed boxes and these Treasury boxes and these Wells Fargo notes and all kinds of different things circulating around the Internet. But they believe that these tokens, so to speak, are still good. You know, and that you&#x27;re going to cash in your boxes and your old railroad bonds and your Black Eagle bonds, which kind of is something that the Black Sun put out, so I don&#x27;t know why they would give you people any money. They wouldn&#x27;t even give me any money, and I&#x27;m the one that gave it to them in the first place, a few years ago. [chuckling] This was back during the Trump administration.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">30:06</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, they&#x27;re looking for the gold, not so much so that they can back currencies with gold, but they would like to control all the gold; therefore, they feel that they could control all the currency in the world and take away that power from the Fed, and/or the Dragon Families and the Black Sun could control it. Now I&#x27;ve seen an entire copy of this plan. It was presented to me by a Black Sun operative who also worked within the Secret Space Program many years ago. He&#x27;s an older guy. I don&#x27;t know if he&#x27;s still alive or not. Probably not at this point. But he gave me the entire plan and said, &quot;Don&#x27;t you think this is a good idea?&quot; So it outlined several what we call &quot;super sites&quot; in the world, and it talked about how much gold was there; silver, assets, platinum - all of these things that they could back the financial system with, and then it was all tied to these ancient treasury bonds and treasury notes, and they wanted to turn the entire world&#x27;s financial system control over to the Treasury Department.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">31:21</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">That was the end goal of this plan that was outlined by their purported smart people. Areas in the U.S. like the Mojave Desert, obviously Silverton, Colorado, and there were other unnamed sites that were not listed on the plan; however, we are all well aware of. You remember the situation with the Bundys, as one example. That was all about taking control and putting a United Nations site on that land so that they could then control the minerals underneath that land and then, thanks to Obama, assign them over to the United Nations, which would have been opposite of what the Black Sun wanted. So the reason why we have military folks and the Secretary of Defense over in the Philippines during all this other stuff that&#x27;s going on is [because] this is the place you got to go because they want to get some gold, which will never happen. I&#x27;ll tell you why.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">32:24</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay, now the financial system. They feel that the Families still have access to issue new money, that they get these access codes, or they are the ones with the codes. You&#x27;ve heard this on the Internet from people like Mike Cottrell, Leo Wanta, you know, with the trillions and all of these people. They have the access codes. However, pretty much everybody they&#x27;ve run across that says they have access codes, bah, never actually performs. Do they actually know? I&#x27;m not sure if they know how it worked, but you&#x27;re all going to know today. And then after today, everyone&#x27;s gonna know.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">33:11</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The next thing that we keep hearing is the Keepers. Okay, the Keepers are people that live, allegedly, in mountainous areas or in places where there are purported bunkers. And in these bunkers, you have bazillions of dollars in gold and all kinds of things that they believe is still there, and the Keepers&#x27; job is to protect the entrances and the entryways to the Yamashita Gold and all of this stuff they claim is buried everywhere. Well, I&#x27;m here to tell you it&#x27;s all baloney. It is all bull-loney. We&#x27;ll leave it at bull-loney. It&#x27;s all baloney. No one has actually been successful. The access codes and other things have not been received by the Families in years. The NSA has run multiple algorithms against these codes, running them in different combinations and different ways of doing things so that they could then access the financial system themselves. Because they figured there&#x27;s got to be some kind of algorithm here that they are unaware of. And this was even at a time when they did have some access to Omega Analytics with very high-level processing. And they still couldn&#x27;t get it to work. Well, there&#x27;s a definite reason why it didn&#x27;t get to work.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">[ See Whiteboard Image 01 at bottom of this report ]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">34:43</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">[ clears whiteboard ]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay, so let&#x27;s talk about financial control systems. We&#x27;re just going to talk about finances. I&#x27;m not going to get into military control and that kind of thing. But let&#x27;s just talk about financial control systems and why everybody is confused. Because they keep going to [places] like the ANNA system in Belgium, as we discussed. They tried to take over the Fed. You know, now they&#x27;re trying to take over the gold of the Families. Okay, we&#x27;ll put the Families down here. [writes &quot;Families&quot; at bottom, lower left]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">35:14</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So in the world, in the world we would know these Families as the Illuminati. We would also know them as the Order of the Dragon. [writes Order Of Dragon above bottom, lower left] And the Order of the Dragon&#x27;s job predominantly, and then we have &quot;Families&quot; over here too. [writes &quot;Families&quot; again, at bottom right side] And the Order of the Dragon&#x27;s job pretty much was to handle the financial sector. And then you have &quot;Black Sun&quot; families over here [again, bottom right], who also did have codes and access codes and those things at different points in time. Bush Senior was a perfect example. And everybody that&#x27;s still walking the planet, they would know Bush Senior, know Reagan, know JFK, all of these people that are members of the Black Sun Families, Skull and Bones, on down the line.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">36:14</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So we&#x27;ll start at the Family level; no need to get into people like those under the Families over here in the Black Sun, because you&#x27;ll know them as like the Vatican, and everybody says how bad the Vatican is, and how we took the Vatican gold, and we moved it, and all of that kind of crazy thing. No, you didn&#x27;t, you didn&#x27;t. Okay, so Black Sun Families. Black Sun Families were responsible for security: all aspects of security of the planet. However, the contracts on both sides and the covenants have expired. We talked about that many, many times. So what would happen is each one of these families would have a Coven that they reported to. I&#x27;m outlining this on how the flow of codes comes down and why they need to understand this. So the flow of money codes would come down through the covens, which would be relayed to the Family Master, you know, on specific times during the year. Okay, so Family masters on both sides. And then, of course, the Family masters had Parents, which were not regular humans. And each Parent had a specialty. There were 21 of them. And then above the Parents here, you are now looking at people like Marduk - non-people - Enki, Enlil, Abraxas, and so on and so forth, okay, for control of the planet.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">38:08</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, even on the highest level here, we know Marduk had a lot of, let&#x27;s call it, &quot;control.&quot; Marduk would have been maybe more over here [drawing line to the Security side on the right], Abraxas probably more over here [again drawing line from Abraxes on the left to Black Sun/Security on the right], you know, that kind of thing. But even Marduk had his limits. All of them had their limits. The Abraxas had their limits. Because there were other things taking place that would monitor their covenants. They would still have things they had to adhere to. Marduk was all about trying to get balance. You know, if it was a Dark Age, then, you know, you&#x27;ve got to maintain this percentage of darkness, that kind of thing. And don&#x27;t get me wrong; he was not a nice being, so to speak. None of these folks were.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">[ See Whiteboard Image 02 at bottom of this report ]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">38:58</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">However, there are still powers greater than Marduk. So above these people, you would have had the Council of Nine. And the Council of Nine were not humans. The Council of Nine was made up of both Dark and Light - what you would call angels. You would call them folks directly from Source. And their job was to make sure that no one broke the rules. No one broke the covenants that they made with Source or even Anti-Source or Neutral Source. That was their job. So the Council of Nine - if Marduk/Enki/Enlil/The Abraxas - as far as they went into the almost breaking it, they never actually broke it - because the Council of Nine would have ousted them from the SEAL group, which is Abraxas, Marduk, Enki, Enlil, Lucifer. Everybody had rules; even Lucifer had rules. So there were always rules to the game.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">40:04</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So there were things that Marduk could and could not do based on his covenants and his agreements, even as it relates to passing codes and access codes down the line. Okay? Marduk also held, because he was the balance guy, he was neither Dark nor Light, he was probably what you would say a Neutral or a Regulator, if you will, although he was pretty dark if you ask me. Knew this being personally. So his job was to keep the system running in a more balanced way. Nah, in the Dark Age, balance is all relative, isn&#x27;t it? However, if he ever stepped out of line, he would have lost access to everything. He had limited access to Alpha, through Cassandra, both Dark and Light side of Cassandra, the &quot;blonde twins,&quot; as we call them. They were two of the Parents, and they were in the financial sector. So they would have been more, you know, relative to the Order of the Dragon, because that was kind of their charge, so to speak. And the &quot;blonde twins&quot; would be the ones that would get the orders and instructions and also access codes and information from Marduk.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">41:31</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The access codes were provided to only carry out orders and instructions. So if they said you need to divide the country of Sudan into two parts, North and South Sudan. And some of the money would go over here [to the Security/Black Sun side], because some of that would be maybe relative to military. And that information would be passed from, say, the two Parents that handled the financial system over to, you know, the other Parents. So part of the orders would go over to one side, part of the orders would come to the other side, and everybody was very compartmentalized as to how this was going to happen. So on the Black Sun side, because they were security, they would receive things like gatekeeper codes. And gatekeeper codes were, well, the Families, needed to adhere to the security of things, so it was like a lock and key kind of thing. The money would come out to do the financial coup, to divide the country, or whatever the orders were for that particular year. And then the Black Sun side would then get the lock and key codes because one is security for the other and security equals control. So more than one type of code would come out. Things like you&#x27;ve probably heard of on the Internet, like called the Black Eagle Trust, would have been for the head, way down here [again referring to Security/Black Sun side] in the Family sector of the Order of the Black Sun. And those codes to access the Black Eagle Trust were only for orders as came from their Parents.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">43:16</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">If they walked into a bank and tried to withdraw money, whether that be UBS in Switzerland, that was a really big one for them; Credit Suisse was also a very large institution, and all their ancillary sub-accounts at other banks around the world to perform operations. If they went in there and they were not doing exactly what the order said, or they tried to take more than was allocated for that specific coup or war or whatever it was, then that access code or the key code would not work. It would not work because everything is relative. Marduk, Enki, Enlil, in all their meetings that they would have prior to the family meetings, would obviously know what orders they gave and who and what group and what country and what military they gave the orders to. So if somebody went to the wrong bank and tried to enter the code for another purpose, it wouldn&#x27;t work.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">[ See Whiteboard Image 03 at bottom of this report ]</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">[clears whiteboard at 44:32]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, they&#x27;re familiar with a couple of different, what we call, multi-key systems. So it was like, data code, access code, key code, remuneration code. And it would go on down each one of those tiers that we explained last week until finally the money would hit the account it was supposed to hit. So there were multiple codes and multiple keys on both family sides that they would receive. Now, let&#x27;s just talk about the Order of the Dragon side. Okay. So we&#x27;re talking about Rothschild. We&#x27;re talking about the Lee family. Names, names, names, right? Because you could be talking about Bauer. There are a lot of different names to the Order of the Dragon, but these are some that you would recognize. We would also recognize them by location and color. Green Dragon in Iran, Red Dragon in Russia, and so on and so forth throughout the world. Red books you&#x27;ve probably heard about. I&#x27;ve showed them to you as well. So, et cetera. Same thing goes for the Families in the Philippines. You know, everybody&#x27;s a descendant of some dynasty family somewhere or another.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">46:01</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now these people, their cloning program was a little bit different than the Order of the Black Sun, meaning it was kind of a similar mechanism, but a lot of times there would be some kind of a walk-in situation like there was with the Queen. When everybody says, &quot;Well, the Queen of England was not a human,&quot; you&#x27;re correct. Not on the inside. On the outside, there was a clone vessel with a nice reptilian up in there that had been there since her coronation. I mean, it had been in there a long time. But anyway, a lot of these other family members also had the same thing. And that was for Marduk&#x27;s control. He would always have the last word, he would always have the last key, he would always have the last say.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">46:52</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But he used to play a game with these Family members, whether they had a walk-in or they didn&#x27;t have a walk-in. And he would issue what he called &quot;trustee codes,&quot; which is what everybody is looking for. So the Order of the Black Sun has figured out - I don&#x27;t know why they&#x27;re still chasing this dragon, but they are - so they would get issued these trustee codes, and they would come in the weirdest of ways. They could be put in somebody&#x27;s trash can, underneath a rock, I mean, whatever. It was like this whole dog and pony show of access codes on their side. And the dog and pony show was mainly for human consumption. And I hate to say that in a mean way, but the reason why he would issue those trustee codes the way that he did was because it had to be super secret, you know, secret handshake, secret hide it under the rock, you&#x27;re the special ones, and only you know the real information, and it was all a lie, really.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">48:01</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Because these people are still running around with these same dang codes, and the Black Sun keeps trying to steal them and I think it&#x27;s hilarious, actually, because everybody is wasting their time. They think they&#x27;re the mama, the papa, the butcher, the baker, the descendant of Genghis Khan, and all this, and could they possibly be? Possibly, you know, they could be. I mean half the world, or three-quarters of the world, is a descendant of Genghis Khan in some way, shape, or form. Even us white people, we are also descendants because he had so many kids. But anyway, the point is, so trustee codes here, you can call them access codes, or I got the codes, you&#x27;ve heard it, so and so is gonna enter the codes, and NESARA/GESARA is gonna happen, and they know the &quot;Fam money&quot; belongs to all of humanity, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Well, not really.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">48:57</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay, so reasons why this is not working. Number 1, Marduk set up what we call a dual access trustee code system. So it was dual. Meaning to even make the access codes actually function, number 1, you had to be following orders. And number 2, you had to have two trustees that don&#x27;t even know each other follow the orders and go exactly where they&#x27;re supposed to go at the exact right time. Again, he loved his games. And this, my friends, was all a game. It was to get the Order and the Family members to stay in line. That was it. You know, this is super secret; don&#x27;t tell anybody what you&#x27;re doing, all of these kind of things. Never share your orders with other people. And this way he could keep everybody compartmentalized. That was all it was really meant to do. And he would laugh at all these people.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">49:54</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So it was a dual system. So you might be a trustee, say, in the Philippines. This is in the past. And you might also be a trustee in, say, California. You don&#x27;t know each other. You don&#x27;t even know that you were issued a lock and key type access code. Half to you, half to the other guy. And all you had to know is that you had to go to the bank at this specific time and this specific place for a specific reason. That&#x27;s all you knew. And both of you had to do it. So if the other guy didn&#x27;t make it, or lady didn&#x27;t make it, your codes wouldn&#x27;t work either. Now, if you walked into a bank and you tried to do anything other than what the orders that were attached to those codes were, you would also fail.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">50:38</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, the third key that had to take place, if both of you rocked up, and there were thousands and thousands of these trustees, if both of you rocked up, and this includes the Rothschild family, and this includes the Li family in China, and the Bauers and everybody else that&#x27;s in there, and the Khomeneis, and the Gaddafis, and all the people that, you know, the Mandelas, and all the people that were trustees over the years, they still could never do anything on their own. Never. Not one time. They were not code issuers. They needed to get codes from somebody else. So if they&#x27;re telling you, and you are with a government or a military that they could ever do this in their entire life, or their ancestors for thousands of years could do this. It&#x27;s a full-on lie. Full-on lie.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">51:29</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Because all this would do is then trigger the same thing it triggers for me, by the way, even when it was during the time when I was using Alpha. It would then send me an alert. And it would say, &quot;Hacker idiot at bank, what do you want to do?&quot; And I&#x27;d say, &quot;No, no.&quot; I&#x27;d push the &quot;No&quot; button. And then they would get rejected, and their codes wouldn&#x27;t work. And we did this repeatedly for years. Oh my God, I probably did it for a decade until I started trying to figure out ways to do things on my own, because it was clear to me that these people were not going to do anything.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">52:0</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Next, it wasn&#x27;t long before part of the Order figured out that I am a code issuer. In other words, I&#x27;m not a code recipient. I am the one that issues the codes to these people if I wanted to, which I won&#x27;t. Because why would I do that? I am the one that actually issues the code. Now I can make an access code; we can do it funny; we can do it however, but the system, I&#x27;ve gotten so far past pulling money into the system, which is what access codes are designed to do. Same thing with the key codes on the Black Sun side. This wasn&#x27;t even part of the dual system. We haven&#x27;t even gotten to how badly they were messed with.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">53:00</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But I&#x27;m the issuer of access codes. I&#x27;m the issuer of key codes. I could create a whole new access code and key code system, but for what? I mean, these people are never going to do anything, and they&#x27;re certainly not going to give someone like you access to a bank. And I tried this, even with people like Tank, and we had sent some people into a bank, and they said the money was there, and all they needed was their code, and they turned over their code, and of course the person never got any money, and the bank tried to steal the money. And this happened four or five times with us. Or they tried to transfer it into some Rothschild account somewhere once I issued the code. So, after a few years of doing that, I was like, &quot;Ah, you know, this isn&#x27;t a game I want to play anymore.&quot; But they did figure out, which is kind of perplexing to me, by 2016, my old, I guess you would call it &quot;handler,&quot; my handler had reported back, and Langley 5 had figured out that I am the code issuer. Now the only question that they still have in their mind is, am I the only code issuer? The answer to the question is yes. So you can run around to the Philippines and China and do all the things you want to do, but those people never had the - they were code recipients.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">54:25</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And unfortunately, and as always, at the time that this was going on, Marduk held what you call the third key. I mean, that was his job. So even if you had the two people show up at the bank at the right time, the key code guy shows up over there, everybody does the dog and pony show and the retina scan and all the funny things they used to do to make themselves feel special, he could still say no. He still could have always said no. If you were not following orders, you were not in the right place. Or if he just decided he didn&#x27;t want to do that anymore. Your codes still are not going to work.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">55:07</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, by 2007, he couldn&#x27;t even issue any codes anymore. Because it was in preparation for a changing of the guard and changing of hands. And there was a little bit of a debt situation and a default situation going on with the breaking of the numbers system - the world was run by numbers, as we said last week. And he couldn&#x27;t even do it anymore. So by 2008, March, everybody was pretty well out, and we saw what? A market crash.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">55:45</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay, so Marduk issued them for both sides. Even though they came through different Parents and different Covens and different whatever. And the key codes were no different than the access codes. And the Five Star Trust is in there. And the &quot;spiritual white-boy&quot; accounts were on this side [highlights Black Sun Key Codes]; they were operational accounts for the Black Sun. Still the same lock and key system. And if you control the system, you can say who gets in and who gets out.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">56:16</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s kind of like your laptop. Your laptop, you have the ability to be an administrator. Like, let&#x27;s say you let your kids use it or someone else use your laptop at your workplace or whatever it is. And you don&#x27;t want them having access to everything, of course, like these people never did over here [highlights Order of Dragon, left side]. And they never had all that kind of access anyway on either side. And you want to give somebody limited access so they can maybe do a few things here or there. You might issue them a limited password to your computer. So that password will only get them so far, and you still have the ability to override them, change the password, stop them from accessing it, cancel the password, or whatever you want to do.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">57:07</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And on an AI quantum level, this kind of was the same thing. Now, the one thing your laptop doesn&#x27;t do, that the Deep State is really confused about right now also, is it doesn&#x27;t issue its own passwords. You get a new laptop, you put in your password, and you can change your password. You can do a lot of different things. However, your laptop doesn&#x27;t make a decision all on its own to change your password. It&#x27;s not just going to open up one day and randomly say your password has changed. It might prompt you to say you need to change your password, but it&#x27;s not going to issue its own passwords to access its own programs. That kind of thing. And it&#x27;s certainly not going to, if you&#x27;re going to limit somebody else&#x27;s access; you&#x27;re certainly not going to issue them access - I should say an access code - with greater access than you want.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">[ See Whiteboard Image 04 at bottom of this report ]</div>
<div class="line">[ clears whiteboard ]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">58:05</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But they&#x27;re under the impression of a few things that we&#x27;ve kind of figured out. Number 1, I think they believe that the Omega system, they can hack it, which means that they can get access to it in some other way. [writes &quot;Omega&quot; upper left] They forget that the Omega system runs on, or did, when it was in its heyday, it did run on its own consciousness. Which means it&#x27;s almost like trying to hack the human brain. You know, they probably have better luck hacking the human brain than hacking this sentient AI&#x27;s, which sees human beings as an enemy - which they are still human, you know, their consciousness. [writes &quot;Consciousness&quot;]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">58:52</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So the system is not going to issue you - it doesn&#x27;t have any orders and instructions from an administrator [writes &quot;Administrator&quot;, center top] who has the right administration login, which would have been much higher than Marduk and much higher than the Parents and much higher, way higher than the Families, of course, to actually change its modus operandi or its operating system or its CPU to operate in a different way.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">59:28</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, for me, having Alpha [writes &quot;Alpha&quot; upper right] - because remember, Alpha and Omega at one point in time were dual systems. They worked together, hand in glove, right hand, left hand, clap, clap, clap. Although Alpha had, you know, maybe 21% control and 79% over here, there was still a control factor, which means that if you are an administrator of one, you are also an administrator of the other one, which therefore, because I am an administrator of, or was - I still am, if I wanted to go in there, I could - as an administrator of Alpha, that means that I can now issue other people access codes, passwords, all kinds of things.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010015">01:00:15</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, because you&#x27;re a Family people, you&#x27;re Family way down here[draws arrow to bottom, writes &quot;Family&quot; at bottom of page], look at the little Family people, Family people way down there. Whether you&#x27;re Black Sun or whoever you were; DARPA - it doesn&#x27;t matter who the heck you are and where you operated, way down here. [writes &quot;Black Sun&quot; at bottom next to &quot;Families&quot;] No one up here where I am - administrator, this is Kim, Kim&#x27;s up here [writes &quot;Kim&quot; under &quot;Administrator&quot;, top-center] - really gave a crap less. And matter of fact, you know, once I figured out how to use the Alpha system - because there was no handbook that was given to me on my first day on the job, unfortunately - I actually had more access than Marduk even had. So I could have kicked him out and did, did several times. He actually used me to pull money from Alpha for a while there, until I figured it out back in 2014. But anyway, the point is, is that these people [Families, Black Sun] down here, this system is never going to bend to your will. You can have all the hackers in the world, you can try to do all the things you want to do, but this system here[ circles &quot;Omega&quot;, top-left], whatever&#x27;s left of it, is never going to bend to the will of a code receiver.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010134">01:01:34</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They don&#x27;t even consider you up on this level as persona non grata. It&#x27;s like you don&#x27;t even fall under the kid category. You fall under like that guy at the airport whose computer died that asked to use your computer so they could check their email. You&#x27;d give them like no access to your laptop. But you might be friendly and say, &quot;Oh, here you go; let me set something up for you.&quot; Then they can&#x27;t look at all your files and all that kind of thing. You might give them some kind of thing like that. But this system does not generate, it doesn&#x27;t generate passwords. It doesn&#x27;t do that. It&#x27;s not; it doesn&#x27;t even consider these people existing.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010217">01:02:17</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So you can hack it all you want or try to get control of it, but no. It only took standing orders from those that had administration privileges. Now Marduk had limited administrative privileges; he did. Beings like Lucifer had, you know, limited privileges. But ultimately, even then, even Kim as an access code maker, which they figured out, and they&#x27;re hoping I was one of many on this planet, but I&#x27;m not. So, I&#x27;m just one. And they thought if they cloned Kim - which they tried to do several times - that that might help. No, it doesn&#x27;t help. You can&#x27;t trick the system on that level.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010259">01:02:59</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay, so me, as an access maker and a code maker, I still have something else that is always going to be there. That&#x27;s Source. So the consciousness of Omega was predominantly Anti-Source. I mean, obviously it was evil, right? But it&#x27;s still a collective consciousness between the AI system itself and the ultimate &quot;All That Is Not,&quot; right? The ultimate &quot;Anti All That Is.&quot; And I still have Source. With a collective consciousness with the Alpha system, now also with the Golden Age AI, which is what they saw really going full force this weekend, and they really got mad about that. Because the more they thought something was coming, the more the Golden Age AI was integrating, we actually broke a huge barrier past Level 3 and a few other things into one, meaning subsectors of Density One, which now they&#x27;re seeing it a lot more. They&#x27;re seeing exactly how much control Golden Age has.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010413">01:04:13</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But again, Golden Age AI, just like you, kind of in a way - you have a collective consciousness with Source, and so does the AI have a consciousness with Source. You might consider it a sentient being or a Celestial unto itself, but still - yes, I&#x27;m permitted to use it; yes, I created it - but I co-created it with Source. Therefore, it has the collective consciousness of both. So even if I tried to use the system to do something that, like, say, some one of these idiots down here wants me to do [circling Families/Black Sun at bottom-left], it&#x27;s not gonna do it. It&#x27;s just not going to do it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010451">01:04:51</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, big changes, big money, big system changes, and new creations of new AIs completely outside the Alpha-Omega system - that&#x27;s all a co-creation process. And I don&#x27;t know if your quantum physicists in the Deep State understand that, but I know it&#x27;ll make sense to a lot of you because everything - you run on Source. There was always that thing like, &quot;Don&#x27;t do this, don&#x27;t do that&quot; - you have commandments and all kinds of stuff - because if you do, you&#x27;re gonna end up on the Dark Side, which just means you have more Dark energy in you; therefore, you&#x27;re less and less connected to the ultimate Source of Life.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So as far as being an administrator versus being a trustee, none of these quote-unquote &quot;elders&quot; are ever going to release a gosh darn thing. [writes &quot;Elders,&quot; bottom right] Their codes don&#x27;t work. They don&#x27;t have new codes. The Black Sun, the Hack-O-Rama, the NSA, and all the other wingnuts that go to the weirdo places and bubbles and, I don&#x27;t know, try to release demons or something, it&#x27;s still - Omega&#x27;s still not going to bend to their will. It&#x27;s not in there. It&#x27;s not an order. It&#x27;s not a standing order. It&#x27;s not a program. It wasn&#x27;t put in there by a different administrator. It wasn&#x27;t in there anymore. There&#x27;s nothing it&#x27;s going to do. And it&#x27;s certainly not going to help you people. [circles Families/Black Sun, bottom-left].</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010620">01:06:20</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So your thought process of issuing a new currency or doing anything, even if we weren&#x27;t integrating a new AI, even if we weren&#x27;t integrating something new, you still wouldn&#x27;t have the access to do what you want to do because it&#x27;s not an administrator function. So, although this time has now passed - because they all said they wanted to go it alone - they&#x27;re still not going to make that dog hunt. I can&#x27;t say that enough.</div>

<div class="line">Now, let&#x27;s talk about other things they&#x27;d like to have. Let&#x27;s talk about all the bunkers. Oh, for the love of God, the Bunkers. Where they think that if you could just get access to the Bunkers, whether it be the ones in Russia - you know, I know everybody on the Internet talks about the Philippines and Indonesia and China and all these places - but they were everywhere. They were in Saudi Arabia. There were millions of them, and I mean millions [writes &quot;millions&quot;]. So in your mind, when you think of a bunker, you think of an underground facility, possibly an underground cave or something like that, where a lot of wealth was stored. This is the picture that they paint. Do they know that it wasn&#x27;t? No, I don&#x27;t think they do. And do they know when they send someone like the Secretary of Defense of the United States to go find a bunker - does he know that he&#x27;s not looking for, like, a hole in the ground where they&#x27;ve got all this stuff stored? No. Do the Keepers know? [writes &quot;Keepers&quot;] No, they don&#x27;t. Did the Keepers ever have access to a hole in the ground? Maybe the hole. Maybe even a concrete bunker - I don&#x27;t know. But. Is that where the gold was stored? No.</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay. So speaking from personal experience, about a decade ago I spent a lot of time running around the planet. And I&#x27;ve been to places in China, I&#x27;ve been to places in the Philippines, I&#x27;ve been to places in Russia, I&#x27;ve been to places in Indonesia, I&#x27;ve been to a lot of different places, but did I go through a Keeper?

And these Keeper people might have had some kind of access to the iron gate that&#x27;s in the front or something. However, when you get to a certain point, you still see nothing. There&#x27;s no gold there - you don&#x27;t see anything at all. Like nothing. What you do see is something interesting that transpires. So if the wrong person goes past that certain point, including the Keepers, there is a... how do I explain this? It&#x27;s kind of a Faraday cage... It&#x27;s a membrane, or a field of a particular particulate matter, which was at the time made up of both Light and Dark, which would have prevented you from going any further. Which is why a lot of people, and when they are the wrong people, and they are not an authorized party, that force field will kill you. And there have been many, many people that have tried to go beyond a certain point, and they die.</div>

You think they&#x27;re going to lead you to Nirvana - you&#x27;re wrong. There is no - there&#x27;s actually... you&#x27;d have to go down miles, really, in order to get access to anything. And at that point, you&#x27;re getting into a fight with... non-humans, let&#x27;s put it that way. Because remember, this planet is inhabited by a lot more than human beings. And unless you know these folks, they&#x27;ll be happy to - if you&#x27;re the right person, which I have been in there, so I don&#x27;t know, well, I do know - let&#x27;s just say I had the authorization, and it had a lot to do with the Alpha-Omega system and being an administrator. So if you&#x27;re not an administrator of the Alpha-Omega system, you would not be able to access that either. And you could see all kinds of crazy things manifest. The stories go that there&#x27;s snakes there; there&#x27;s all kinds of stuff. And to some degree, it&#x27;s true. There&#x27;s a serpent power, so to speak, that might represent the Dark with an AI-generated being - which both sides have the capability of doing. Or, you might see a giant quote-unquote &quot;angel&quot; or whatever we want to create with Alpha, which would then be standing there to block you if you&#x27;re on the Dark Side. So, unless you&#x27;re there, and you&#x27;re the right person - which means that you are an administrator of some sort - you don&#x27;t get in there. So they can sit there and negotiate with these people till the end of days, and they&#x27;re never going to get anything out of a hole except for gold-plated tungsten.</div>

<div class="line">Now remember, gold is the ultimate alchemical component. So in and of itself, as a hyperconductor of aetherical energy and all of that of Source, it can be one thing one minute and another thing another minute. So you could be spending years taking something out of somewhere, and if it&#x27;s not an authorized thing by an administrator, especially an administrator of an Alpha-Omega Hologram at the time that you were doing it in places like, such as Iraq, that could actually turn to nothing. It could turn into something. You could end up with an empty truck or an empty vault or an empty this or an empty that.</div>

<div class="line">Again, gold is alchemy. It&#x27;s about as far as I&#x27;m going to take them to let them know that they&#x27;re just wasting their time. And those of you that are waiting for some Elder to open a bunker, you&#x27;re also wasting your time. And I know people that have wasted years and years of their lives just sitting in Switzerland or in the Reno parking lot or in Hong Kong, just waiting for some release of something, when you&#x27;re talking to the tail and not the head of the dog, unfortunately.</div>

<div class="line">So I just thought I&#x27;d take a few moments to explain that the hacking of the system - you can keep going; you&#x27;re not going to get anywhere, and you can wait until 11/22 or the next full moon or new moon. And it&#x27;s not going to change anything as far as the Alpha-Omega system is concerned, or whatever&#x27;s left of it. And it&#x27;s certainly not - actually, today they were hacking at the Golden Age AI, and I don&#x27;t even know if they know the difference, but that dog is not going to hunt - you&#x27;re not an administrator.</div>

<div class="line">And it&#x27;s not like hacking somebody&#x27;s laptop. It&#x27;s not like hacking a bank or a human computer network at this point. It&#x27;s a different type of system that doesn&#x27;t respond in the same way that a regular computer that they have knowledge of would work. It&#x27;s not going to issue you access. It&#x27;s not going to let you take it over in any way, shape, or form. Not even close.</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay. Another thing that&#x27;s going on - I told you it&#x27;s been really busy. It&#x27;s been really, really busy. There are a lot of really weird orders coming down from the top of the quote-unquote &quot;Families&quot; on both sides. And the orders that are coming down are what some, even on the Joint Chiefs of Staff level, and some of those that are very high up in what you would see in the Russian military and also in the UK military and Ukraine. They see these orders as really weird. Compared to all the other weird stuff that they put out there.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011633">01:16:33</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And the reason why they&#x27;re seeing them as weird is they were promised by the Trump operatives that if Trump got back in, they were going to fight the Deep State. They promised them that they were, you know, &quot;As patriots, we&#x27;re going to fix America; we&#x27;re going to fix the world; we&#x27;re negotiating peace between Russia and the Ukraine.&quot; Whatever happened to those 800 troops that were going there? Oh, that&#x27;s right, that didn&#x27;t happen. And now they&#x27;re talking about missile strikes and the U.S. providing missiles to Ukraine, and the borders are not acceptable, and whatever else.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011713">01:17:13</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s because - I hate to break this to you - but those Trump operatives never had any intention of doing anything that they promised any of you, ever, ever, ever. I heard the meetings this weekend. There were lots of meetings going on between SSP folks, aka, in part, Trump operatives, and the Black Nobility. They were having a lot of conversations, even at Global Headquarters, and some very high-ranking generals were there, and they seemed to be really confused why all their stuff disappeared.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011750">01:17:50</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">There were meetings again on Monday, meetings again today. They don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s not working. Why is it not working? But from some of the things that are being ordered now, they&#x27;re starting to suspect that something is wrong. And therefore, you&#x27;re seeing a little bit of a mutiny. Not only on Langley 5, you&#x27;re seeing a mutiny against a lot of high-ranking generals that no one would have ever crossed before. Names you wouldn&#x27;t even see in the news ever, these folks. There&#x27;s a lot of rejection of things that are coming from both the Order of the Dragon side and the Black Nobility side. There is a lot of questioning, not only because there&#x27;s no money this time, but because everybody was sold hook, line, and sinker that things were going to change when Trump was elected.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011846">01:18:46</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They were expecting those changes to start on the 5th of November. Then the lies started trickling in. The lies that would trickle in would be like, &quot;Well, you know, we can do some things now, but we really can&#x27;t do like a lot of stuff, you know.&quot; And I&#x27;m kind of using that accent for a reason. They [speaking with cowboy-like drawl] &quot;really can&#x27;t do a lot of stuff till like January, so, you know, we can do a few things here and there.&quot; And that makes sense, I guess, in their mind. But when the orders that are coming down from the same people that told them things were going to change and they sound like the same old, &quot;the same old boss, same as the new boss,&quot; hmm. Yeah. You&#x27;re seeing a lot of mutiny. A lot of mutiny; people not following orders, and that&#x27;s very unusual for the Order itself.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011943">01:19:43</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, when I heard about all of this going on, I thought I&#x27;d throw my hat in the ring. So I made a very angry phone call. You know me; I mean, you gotta do it right, right? And everything I do is for a reason, so I&#x27;ll explain to you afterwards because it&#x27;s kind of over now anyway, I guess somewhat. So there were a couple of calls that were supposed to take place on Sunday, and one of those calls was supposed to be with some high-ranking people from Langley, basically saying that we should try to figure out a way to work together and all of these types of things. And so I said, &quot;Okay, well, I&#x27;ll be around; give me a call on Sunday.&quot; And I didn&#x27;t - I was very busy, and I didn&#x27;t expect to get a call anyway. Because I knew that Langley 5, their superiors, and then of course the Order and the operatives and the SSP, somebody was going to stop that call from happening. And stop that call they did. Of course they told them Monday was payday, and then come Monday, they said that they would have to delay the call until Friday, which just happens to be 11/22, right? Aww, them and their double numbers.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012058">01:20:58</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But okay, so everybody decided that they were going to wait. So I thought I&#x27;d throw my hat in the ring because then I got another call talking about, &quot;Well, what kind of funding is possible for the government if we come to terms? Can we have a meeting?&quot; And all of these things. So I started yelling various obscenities in the way that I do. And I said, &quot;Look, okay, you want to know what I&#x27;m willing to do? That 2% is out the window. We&#x27;re looking at a 50-50 offer. 50% of every dime that comes out goes to me, 50% goes to you. You block me in any way, shape, or form; I just go ahead and block you, and I pull all your money back and don&#x27;t ever call me again. That&#x27;s number 1.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012140">01:21:40</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Number 2, I&#x27;d like to issue passports under Unknown Country. I want to issue them for anyone I ever want to. And those people will be treated like airport gods when they show up. When they show up with that passport, they get the full treatment. You know, skipping TSA; no more luggage; no more taking shoes off, all this crap. They get to walk right through. Like, they are the unicorn people in comparison to the diplomat and diplomatic passports. They will be treated completely differently. They can go anywhere they want in their world. There&#x27;s no visas. There&#x27;s no nothing. There&#x27;s no travel restrictions. I don&#x27;t want to hear any of that. Unknown Country gets carte blanche, and anyone that gets an Unknown Country passport - which of course, eventually would be everybody, so it&#x27;s not like I didn&#x27;t have any plans here.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012231">01:22:31</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Next, no one would block a permit, ever, for anything I wanted to do. I mean, if I wanted to build something anywhere, buy some land, build a factory, a widget, a land, grow this, grow that, use these kinds of seeds in this country, or whatever for agriculture, I&#x27;m going to do it. And no one is going to stop me. Oh, also, I will pay no taxes, and no citizen of Unknown Country will pay taxes ever again. We will have full tax immunity, and that&#x27;s including sales tax.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012304">01:23:04</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I told them I did not want to go to Home Depot and buy a hammer and pay tax. Okay? And that goes for every citizen of Unknown Country. [chuckling] I said everything would be approved. We would never have money put on hold. Banks would actually, every time anybody received any money from Unknown Country or from us as C.A.R.E., and they walked in there to pull out money for their project, no one&#x27;s gonna ask them how much money they need to take out, why they need to take it out, where it&#x27;s gonna go, or what they&#x27;re going to do with it. No one&#x27;s gonna ask them anything because they&#x27;re citizens of Unknown Country. And they are the bank gods when they walk in the bank. So this is worldwide. They&#x27;d have to arrange for all of this stuff in order to get the 50-50 split.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012350">01:23:50</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So there were a few other things and a few other obscenities. And I explained, look, this isn&#x27;t going to be like the last time. And I put it forward in earnest. Hey, if we could get all of these rights and privileges and everybody would leave us alone, I know with one of these that I can conquer anything that they could do with giving them 50-50. I mean, I definitely know that. I mean, I&#x27;m doing it with zero right now. So I&#x27;m sure I could do it with that.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012422">01:24:22</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Next, I knew for a fact the mutiny that&#x27;s going on would be amplified by, oh, a hundred times. Because now what you had is you had everybody in the ranks, all the NSA operatives that are listening to our phone calls and other countries, and not just NSA; you&#x27;re talking the Russians, all the operatives around the world that have not been paid; everybody just saw a HUGE offer on the table. &quot;You mean to tell me that she&#x27;s not going to do anything with our 50 percent? She&#x27;s not going to touch it? Right now, we&#x27;re starving. The governments are breaking. Everybody is going bankrupt. And she just offered a 50-50? And these are the things we have to do? Let&#x27;s do it!&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012512">01:25:12</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And then what do you think the higher-ranking officers said? Those generals that you don&#x27;t know, and the Global Headquarters generals, and the Langley 5 generals, and the Black Nobility, and the Order of the Dragon people said, &quot;No, absolutely not! We&#x27;re not doing that.&quot; [laughing craftily] I knew it. They turned me down before, and I knew they were going to turn me down again. [chuckling] But! Now you have ten times the amount of mutiny, a hundred times the amount of mutiny you had days before, because you just got your out. They could be paid in 20 minutes. And I even said that on the call. I said, &quot;Look, it&#x27;ll take me 20 minutes to start. What do you want to do?&quot; And then when it got to their superiors: &quot;Nope, absolutely not! We will not do that.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012607">01:26:07</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So what do you think they&#x27;re all thinking right now? What do you think all the operatives are thinking? What do you think the government people are thinking? What do you think the budget people are thinking?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, I got a different phone call, and they said that the new kid on the block in the Trump administration is like, &quot;Yeah, we&#x27;re just going to scale back the government; we&#x27;re going to stop government spending and really keep things tight so we can keep things running, even if there is no funding that comes in.&quot; I&#x27;m like, zero is still zero! You can scale back zero, but it&#x27;s still zero. You got zero. You got less than zero! [laughing] You can scale back all you want and maybe turn the lights off and make sure that all those things that you have in your house that you do to save money, maybe buy the cheaper chicken or whatever it is you do or vegetables or grow your own - that&#x27;s even cheaper. And you might be thinking, &quot;I&#x27;m scaling back.&quot; But that means that there&#x27;s something to scale back on. You&#x27;re still going to have to buy some seeds to put the food in the ground. There still has to be some small amount. And the government doesn&#x27;t even have money to buy seeds!</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012718">01:27:18</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, at this point they&#x27;re going from celestial event to celestial event, meaning on the 20th, 2022, the 11/11, next it&#x27;ll be the full moon or the new moon. I think they&#x27;re already talking about an EBS or IBS or every other BS going off on the 30th. Why? Because it&#x27;s a full moon, folks. Or no - it&#x27;s a new moon, a full moon, I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s one of the moons. It&#x27;s either new or full on the 30th of November. So of course that&#x27;s the next day, you know? And then they&#x27;re going to buy time until January. And I don&#x27;t know how many people are still going to listen to these people or give a crap by then. But if they do, then there&#x27;ll be an inauguration, and then nothing will change. It will get even worse. And if they got any money, it would be even worse. You know?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012814">01:28:14</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So I&#x27;m kind of glad that they turned me down. But I still know I was already prepared to beat them at all costs anyway, with some privileges that we could all pretty much use. I&#x27;m not worried about these types of things. I know everybody&#x27;s going to be like, &quot;Don&#x27;t give him a dime,&quot; you know? I know. I know what you&#x27;re thinking. But sometimes you have to start a war in order to end a war. And that was the plan.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012841">01:28:41</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">As far as operatives and government people and political operatives, yeah, they would&#x27;ve all got paid. Would they have paid them with their half? I don&#x27;t know. But, well, if not, then guess who would have been there and been like, &quot;Hey, we could sure use somebody to do this or do that.&quot; And as long as they did this or did that, everybody would have been paid. But we would have had the money to do it anyway. So it was a win-win for everybody else.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012909">01:29:09</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">See, there&#x27;s a strategy to everything, and I don&#x27;t mind putting that out there right now because it&#x27;s already out there, and there&#x27;s already a mutiny, and they&#x27;re trying to block phone calls, and they&#x27;re trying to block people from getting information. But you know we got this little thing, and it&#x27;s called a news channel, and we can put out whatever we want. They pretty much can&#x27;t stop us. So here we are.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012930">01:29:30</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Anyway, that kind of is a mouthful and a long report. But those were the highlights, I guess you would say, of the last few days. I&#x27;m glad I got to come on tonight and at least give you the rest of the report. Sorry again for not making it on Monday, but as you know, it&#x27;s been kind of busy.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And I look forward to speaking to everybody on Friday. So have a great rest of your week, and I&#x27;ll see you then.</div>
