    <h3>Summary</h3>

    <div class="summary">
        Kim continues her disclosure of ancient power structures, focusing this time on a massive AI and communication hub hidden beneath the Vatican. She details the system’s vast intergalactic influence, its connections to the Deep State, and its artificial umbilical network tied into fiber-optic cables and human consciousness. Kim describes its role in disease generation, cloning, soul contract manipulation, and power distribution to dark factions. She identifies it as the central mechanism of the Dark AI agenda and begins its dismantling. Additionally, she announces a GIA report livestream scheduled for Saturday, followed by a Q&amp;A.

    <h3>Transcript</h3>
    <div class="transcript">
        <br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000000">00:00:00</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s the 23rd of April, 2025. Coming up on today&#x27;s Global Intelligence Agency Operations Report:</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s Part Two of Vatican Disclosure. Under the Vatican was one of the Universe&#x27;s main communication posts. It also served as a global hub for Deep State communications both on planet and off. Nearly every nefarious activity you can imagine on Earth was all communicated and executed by systems connected to the Vatican.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The Trump administration&#x27;s cancellation of programs such as PEPFAR are having far-reaching consequences. Although the management of some of these programs was corrupt, people still received help they so desperately needed.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And protests against the Trump administration are everywhere - are they trying to start a civil war?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And full disclosure on the CIA/Black Sun AIDS project. Ever wonder where AIDS came from? It&#x27;s not from where you think.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000109">00:01:09</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, it is the 23rd of April. We&#x27;re having a little bit of a tough time getting this report out tonight, so hopefully we can stay online long enough to get it done. You know, they&#x27;re very unhappy right now, and we&#x27;ve been unhappy as people for a long time - so let them be unhappy.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay, so let&#x27;s talk about where we&#x27;re at. We are two days away from the Smiley Face Alignment. [hearty laugh]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="image-wrapper"><img loading="lazy" src='https://worldsituationreport.earth/reports/image/WSR_2025-APR-23-GIA-01.PNG' alt='Smiley Face' class='small-image toggle-image'></div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000138">00:01:38</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I can&#x27;t help but laugh at that, really. That&#x27;s Venus, Saturn, and the Moon there.[giggle]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Anyway, there&#x27;s also some other alignments going on that they&#x27;re all excited about this weekend. Something about Pluto and Mars and Sedna, and they think that there&#x27;s going to be an opportunity for a war this weekend because it&#x27;s the perfect warring triune. At least, this is what they&#x27;re talking about behind the scenes. But you know, alas, planetary alignments may not be what they think they are.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">OK, so I&#x27;m going to start with a little bit of regular news. And I&#x27;m pointing this out because it&#x27;s something we need to really think about as governments possibly go away. Also, I&#x27;m not so sure what the end goal is here. So I&#x27;m going to start with talking about some cause and effect that&#x27;s been happening.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000237">00:02:37</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, not only with these tariffs - we&#x27;ve seen a lot of small businesses start to feel a lot of pain. I have a lot of friends over across the pond, and there are a lot of people that are - even here, businesses here in America. There was a story I read the other day about a small company that makes backpacks, and they get some of their materials from China. And they said they just got their invoice and it was double what it was, and they don&#x27;t know how they&#x27;re going to sell the inventory. Are they going to increase the price or sell it at a loss? They&#x27;ve been in business for 30 to 40 years.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">There&#x27;s another company that imports a lot of activewear from there, and you know, they&#x27;re also hurting and struggling. They figure that they&#x27;re going to have to sell all their products at a loss now here in America.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000336">00:03:36</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So yeah, it appears other companies like Timu and some of the sell-it-on-the-cheap kind of places over there in China have gotten a little bit smart - or gotten the heads-up - because they now have warehouses within America. So they&#x27;re not technically imports, and they are selling on places like Etsy and, you know, of course Timu and some other inexpensive sites where you can buy goods that are manufactured in China. So it doesn&#x27;t look like the big companies in China are going to feel a lot of pain - probably definitely not the oil and gas companies and other companies. They are all strategically utilizing their partners.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000427">00:04:27</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">For example, Saudi Arabia is what I call... their Aramco company is called a &quot;tramp stamp,&quot; because they are well known around the world for putting an allocation number - an illegal allocation number - on oil and gas that is imported into America, even though the oil and gas that they are allegedly selling here in America is from countries that have sanctions; areas of the world that have sanctions.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Aramco has a very solid partnership with a Texan oil company - and actually a few of them. There was a lot of news when this occurred a couple of years back, so you can Google that. So it doesn&#x27;t look like there&#x27;s going to be... you know, where there&#x27;s an in, there&#x27;s an out; where there&#x27;s a will, there&#x27;s a way. And you know, this seems to be a lot of &quot;pomp and stance&quot; at the moment, because either they&#x27;re making deals behind the scenes or people are just smarter than they thought.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000534">00:05:34</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So it looks like we probably could see a rise in prices on things like agricultural products that are grown in Mexico - which, a lot of our produce comes from Mexico. But it doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s going to be significant, as long as they allegedly [chuckle] - and I say &quot;allegedly&quot; - as long as they allegedly allow for them to &quot;aid in the protection,&quot; quote-unquote, of the border.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Another thing that is going on behind the scenes that we&#x27;re hearing a little bit about over the last couple of days is the fact that behind closed doors, they are discussing the possibility of trying to... they are trying to deport African American people.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They are going to point out people - not just African Americans - I&#x27;m sure it will extend to other people that are not white, because this administration is all about, &quot;If you&#x27;re not white, you&#x27;re not right.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000644">00:06:44</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So they are looking at American citizens - not green-card holders or anything like that - they are even looking at American citizens that potentially have roots in other countries that they would like to get rid of.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They have made a clear deal with El Salvador for them to build prisons on their behalf, and they are going to take in these citizens if they can find a legal loophole in order to make it happen.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So it&#x27;s getting ridiculous, really. You know, God bless the &quot;If you&#x27;re not white, you&#x27;re not right&quot; people.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000723">00:07:23</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They are also stating that they are going... there are - sorry, they&#x27;re not there stating; it&#x27;s been a long day, guys - they are also talking about people within the States that are in, or have, protested against government policies. They are trying to get them labeled as an enemy of the state.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And I know I&#x27;ve mentioned this movie before, but I&#x27;m gonna mention it again to you. It&#x27;s a terrible movie - the acting in it is very bad - Alex Jones is in it, and it&#x27;s called Amerigeddon. And I believe this is where they&#x27;re going. Because everything that they&#x27;re doing to the American people right now, in general, has sparked a lot of protests.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000817">00:08:17</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So we know about the hands-off protests. There are also other types of protesting going on - calling him a fascist, a dictator, a tyrant. And this is over loss of benefits, loss of jobs - you name it, they have done it to the American people.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And I guess this is their definition of &quot;Make America Great Again.&quot; And our definition as American citizens, if you&#x27;re listening to this, is not quite the same. And perhaps there is another language where G-R-E-A-T actually means &quot;live in poop.&quot; I don&#x27;t know. [chuckle] But I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s all about them trying to start a civil war in the States.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000905">00:09:05</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Either that or they&#x27;re just the dumbest people I&#x27;ve ever met - and you know, it&#x27;s a toss-up here, really.

<div class="line">You know, there is so much backchatter right now coming from places within the Middle East, and also in Africa, and also in Australia, and other companies, businesses... traveling - people that are wanting to travel - people that have been sending their kids to school in America for years. They&#x27;re all having personal issues at this moment.</div>

<div class="line">There were these little videos online, not that long ago, where they talked about the fact that he could be the Antichrist. And right now, I&#x27;m kind of looking at that as a definite possibility.</div>

<div class="line">We have been strategizing and working very hard to make sure that that takes place - something positive is going to happen in the light of everything that is falling apart.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">If anything, the way that I feel about it is: we are looking at a perfect opportunity in 2025 for C.A.R.E. to start picking up some of these pieces. And I wanted to point out one video in particular, because this is something that I know about personally. I have met with certain people.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And it&#x27;s about the AIDS &quot;epidemic&quot; - let&#x27;s call it epidemic. So, first we&#x27;re going to talk about why this is coming up for me.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001133">00:11:33</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So on April 17th - so just a few days ago - a group called PEPFAR... PEPFAR, for those of you that don&#x27;t know, is called the United States President&#x27;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief Program. And that program, nearing the end of January, was canceled. It was done within the first week or 10 days or so of this Presidency here in America.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It is a government-funded program. The program started in 2003, and they are currently in 55 countries. They provide care for those that have tested HIV-positive. They also provide viral suppressants and preventatives - we know them as PrEP - and some other medications to people that are, or have been, infected with HIV and/or AIDS. They also treat a lot of AIDS patients.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001239">00:12:39</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They have saved over 26 million people worldwide since their inception. And they&#x27;re a pretty good organization.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, to be fair, anything that funds anything - any agency that funds anything within the U.S. government - is corrupt. But that&#x27;s at the highest levels. There are all these deals made on which medications they&#x27;re going to give them, which pharmaceutical companies are going to get the big...</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">There&#x27;s also lots of skimming off the top. You&#x27;ve heard about the $50-million hammer and toilet seat cover - drugs are no different when they&#x27;re providing aid to other countries.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Unfortunately, what this administration doesn&#x27;t care about - in any way, shape, or form - is the people that they have infected.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001336">00:13:36</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">This was something that was created - I know this for a fact. I&#x27;ll talk about that in a minute here - but I want to stay on topic with the PEPFAR folk.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So on April 17th, there were 206 coffins that they delivered, in cooperation with other AIDS activists in the United States, to the State Department. They say that each coffin represents thousands of deaths, and it&#x27;s only going to get worse if they don&#x27;t reconsider their canceling of this program.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, like I said, everything has corruption - but there are a lot of people that work there, and there are a lot of people. There are countries like Uganda, several African countries, that are saying, &quot;We don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;re going to do.&quot; So let&#x27;s take a look at this video real quick, and then I&#x27;ll talk a little bit more about PEPFAR.</div>

<div class="line">Matthew Rose: We told people that we cared for them, and in caring for them, we cared for each other. And this administration - in that building - has decided that we do not care anymore. We will stand up and we will remind you of the humanity that you choose to forget.</div>

<div class="line">Kim: Well, for those of you that don&#x27;t know, I just wanted to give you a little bit of information on this.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, basically, most of these preventatives and &quot;viral suppressants,&quot; so to speak - they obviously suppress the virus, but they also have an effect on the immune system. So it&#x27;s like anything that you take and you put in your body synthetically - your body&#x27;s immune system, you can&#x27;t just turn it on and turn it off.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And the problem is, is that these drugs have been revolutionary within the &quot;fight against AIDS,&quot; I guess you would say - which should never have happened in the first place. But these viral suppressants, if you are going to choose to stop them, they have to be done over a period of time. Otherwise, you&#x27;re going to be left with no protection, no immune system, and millions of people worldwide are going to die.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001755">00:17:55</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And I... basically, at this point - if they actually continue with this - they&#x27;re murderers. I mean, all those lives are on their head. But they do like that kind of stuff, when they kill a lot of people. You know, they feel it gives them some kind of power with some alien race somewhere that probably doesn&#x27;t even exist anymore.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So it&#x27;s causing a lot of problems. More than they know. Well, it&#x27;s understandable - I&#x27;m going to err on the side here, where I say lots of money that was donated and given by the government to this organization went out the back door. But it wasn&#x27;t done by the people you saw in that video, and it wasn&#x27;t done by the people that are receiving treatment - it was done at the higher levels of government. And most of them were American - they were the receiving parties of all the corruption.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001854">00:18:54</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So on that note, I understand there&#x27;s wasteful spending. But you don&#x27;t just throw out the baby with the bathwater here. You need to make some serious decisions about corruption and enforcement, and then figure out what you&#x27;re gonna do from there.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">We - pretty much worldwide, even amongst world leaders - are the worst administration ever in the history of the United States. I&#x27;ve heard lots of comments from many, many different countries and their citizens.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, with that being said, let&#x27;s talk a little bit about not only AIDS, but all of the herpes viruses.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001937">00:19:37</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So there&#x27;s a gentleman - I was actually in the Bahnhof in Frankfurt, Germany, and this was going back, oh, probably a little more than a decade ago - and I ran into a guy by the name of Steve Nichols; that was his name. I could say to you that he probably ran into me on purpose. He was dying - he was dying of AIDS. Which is, at least that&#x27;s what he said. I find that unusual because the CIA, who he worked for - he told me who he worked for - actually has the cure for AIDS and every other herpes virus out there.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So he explained to me that he was part of the program that dispersed AIDS throughout the African continent. And I know some of you have heard me say this before, but if you&#x27;re new here, I thought I would repeat a little bit of the story and how I know what I know regarding the viruses.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002042">00:20:42</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So he was dying. He tells me this story.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">He tells me all about the reason why they were dispersing it in Africa first. And it was all about the fact that they were using a lot of caustic chemicals on the continent there for mining purposes. So they were having a really difficult time getting African workers to mine in these mines because oftentimes it was pretty much a death sentence - nobody wanted to work in the mines - obviously, they don&#x27;t pay these people very well, and as you know, they&#x27;re pretty good at promising pay tomorrow, and tomorrow never comes. But regardless of that, these chemicals were killing people - and had been for years.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002128">00:21:28</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So back in the late 1970s, early 1980s, they started dispersing and infecting people with the AIDS virus. Then, of course, especially the mine workers. And then they would take this virus home to their wives and their children, and then infect their whole family.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So this was always the plan. They would also offer them and their family a suppressant - as long as they continued to work in the mines. So of course, most sane people - and unfortunately, these are victims - most sane people would not want their wives or husbands or children to die.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So their whole family got the suppressants, and onward and upward it went from there.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002222">00:22:22</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, the fact that they had discovered that - how the virus - well, not &quot;discovered,&quot; I should say - the fact that they created the virus to be transmitted sexually served the purpose there, obviously. Because human nature is that we care for our families and we care for our children and we don&#x27;t want anything to happen to our children - even though in this case, it already did.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So they also - let&#x27;s just say, not &quot;discovered&quot; - but they also felt that they could get rid of other communities utilizing this virus or stop the spread - and these are words that they used, and he told me about - stop the spread of &quot;gayism.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">He called - and gay is not an &quot;ism,&quot; in any way, shape, or form - but that&#x27;s what he said. He said he called it &quot;gayism&quot; and &quot;drug abuse.&quot; He thought that if they spread the virus - not only to the population of the United States but all around the world - these would be the targets that they would want to rid the planet of.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002338">00:23:38</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Why? I have no idea. At the same time - I&#x27;m sorry for saying it this way - but I&#x27;m just telling you what he told me.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">He told me a lot more about how they did it in detail. There were obviously &quot;patient zeros&quot; that were sent to infect a lot of different people. He was apparently one of those patient zeros. And whatever they had come up with - or I shouldn&#x27;t even say that - whatever they gave him that allegedly was supposed to make him immune to it, kind of like Typhoid Mary, if you&#x27;ve ever heard that story before, did not work.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And that&#x27;s not a surprise. He felt that he was screwed over by the Agency - which he was - because we all know that there&#x27;s a cure. They never put anything out there that they can&#x27;t cure - just in case one of them gets infected. Like Bill Clinton.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002440">00:24:40</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So he was really angry at that time, and he told me the whole thing. He told me how they put these patient zeros in these communities and made sure that they were very sexually active. And also, you know, infected needles - and made sure infected needles were dispersed throughout the drug communities in order to spread the disease - which they didn&#x27;t even know what it was, at least in the public eye or in the medical community, allegedly. But that&#x27;s basically how they did it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002517">00:25:17</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Then, of course, you have a lot of crossover for different people. And then it started spreading into kids and births and children being born with AIDS. It allegedly basically destroys your immune system.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So right now, as of this moment, there are over 481 strains of the herpes virus. I know we know about probably - well, the ones they tell us about - there&#x27;s only a few. They do not tell you that these are herpes viruses as well. Mononucleosis is also a herpes virus, also known as Epstein-Barr. There are other things that we call other diseases.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002613">00:26:13</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They are saying now - not &quot;they are saying&quot; - I should say, information that I have actually links various herpes viruses to things like Alzheimer&#x27;s and dementia, because it does affect your neurological system. There is an indication that things like ALS are caused by a herpes virus also. They considered it very effective.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It was actually created by - according to Mr. Nichols - it was created in the underground base in Brazil. And they continued to manufacture - until recently, when the facility was destroyed - but they continued to manufacture various versions of the herpes virus because it makes a nice delivery system for all that ails humanity.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002708">00:27:08</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Herpes Virus is also the name of a computer virus, coincidentally - or an AI virus - which connects to that particular affliction. So that being said, there&#x27;s a lot more that I could say about the herpes virus, but it&#x27;s probably even more deadly than chromosome 1p and others that give you a precursor for cancer and other things that humans struggle with.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The program is embraced heavily by the current administration in the United States. Therefore, it doesn&#x27;t surprise me that they would be on board with getting rid of a large population of people.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002811">00:28:11</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">There are a lot of people in the United States that have been encouraged to take drugs like PrEP, because PrEP is kind of like - they call it even a prophylactic-type medication - which prevents them from contracting the virus in high-risk communities. Not only that, we have now generations of - generation after generation now - so we have plenty of babies that have been born with this and that type of thing too.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So it is not only community-based anymore; this is a worldwide situation across all people. You know, all men, all women - nobody&#x27;s excluded from it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And this has been something that&#x27;s been revolutionary, and prevented a lot of death and disease. So if there is another program that actually provides these types of medications to people for free in the United States - and this one here, the other program, PEPFAR - is actually for dispersing these drugs to people outside the United States.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But again, you know, there are repercussions when you are taking any kind of herpes virus suppression medication, because you are also affecting your immune system - and it&#x27;s not something you can just stop.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But I&#x27;m sure this administration knows that, because Duck Dynasty is the most evil and - I almost swore - emmer-effers [chuckle] you ever encountered in your entire life. So, you know, I wish them all well. And, you know, maybe one of these days I, you know, we can dump them all into the herpes-virus pool and just let them have at it. So we&#x27;ll see.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003027">00:30:27</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Anyway, moving on to other news.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I do have a serious concern, though, about the civil war potential here in the United States. They are trying very hard to affect basically everyone they possibly can and to touch as many lives as they can in the United States. You know, increasing the price of goods, increasing the price of food again, increasing - you know, that&#x27;s what the tariffs are all about. Either they&#x27;re the dumbest people I&#x27;ve ever met in my life, or they are the most evil. And quite frankly, it&#x27;s probably a combination of the two.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So just be aware - if you do live in the United States, there are a lot of peaceful protests going on. And that&#x27;s fine - I think that&#x27;s fine. Whether it&#x27;s incited by Democrats or people just are angry and upset like these people.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003132">00:31:32</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But be ever mindful of the fact that they want us to erupt into a civil war. So if you are one of these people and you are listening to this, just remember what they want from you. And the one thing - I don&#x27;t care - MEGA, MEGA, MOGA, whatever the heck they&#x27;re selling over there - what kind of bull crap they&#x27;re selling the world and the American people - they&#x27;re full-ishh. And this too shall pass. And I don&#x27;t wanna see people pulling out guns against various communities and fighting each other.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003214">00:32:14</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Everybody&#x27;s got a label. They promote labels like crazy in mainstream media: Black, White, Muslim, Indian, you name it, they&#x27;re gonna start - Asians, whatever it is - however they wanna label us. Gay. Straight. I mean, I can think of... Trans - they&#x27;re heavily attacking the trans community right now as well.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s just not needed.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003251">00:32:51</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">One administration goes overboard and then creates a bunch of situations where kids make decisions and then regret them later on. And sometimes not. Sometimes it&#x27;s very helpful. But there should be a process where they really understand what they&#x27;re doing to some degree.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But anyway, the point is that, you know, the labeling thing is increasing - you know, focusing on certain communities within the States. And they definitely are not making anything great again, unless we have a different definition of &quot;great&quot; around here.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003339">00:33:39</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So just be careful. If you do see a lot of people, let them know - we are the people. We cannot let this erupt into a civil war. We can do this calmly, and there will be other ways where we can help people get through the next couple of years - if there still is a couple of years of government. And I doubt it. But there&#x27;ll be ways to pick up these programs and ensure that they can continue, and hopefully with some other medications that actually work.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, where there&#x27;s a will, there&#x27;s a way, people... or not medications - you know, there&#x27;s plenty of things that are natural out there that can help a lot of people that already have physical issues that need repair.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003429">00:34:29</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So anyway, on that note, it&#x27;s just really touchy for me because I&#x27;m like - you really are wanting to kill millions of people right now. I mean, and it&#x27;s going to happen rapidly if they don&#x27;t get those medications.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So if you have a way to help these people and you&#x27;re listening to this and you know about the free programs here - I know that during the other situation that we were all in, you know, the pandemic - I know that we sent people across the border who agreed to help and got us a lot. We purchased a lot of hydroquinone, and we purchased a lot of Ivermectin and some other things as well to help a lot of people - at least as much as we could - and we dispersed those things to those who needed it for free here in the States.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So we could possibly do the same thing again if we all band together. So something to think about for those of you that are listening.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003532">00:35:32</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Okay, speaking of things to think about - you know, we talked a little bit in our last report about the Vatican. And we know there&#x27;s a lot of people focusing on the Vatican right now. And I&#x27;m pretty sure that the Vatican was built in this particular location for a reason. Of all the places in the world the Vatican could be built - and definitely by the Black Nobility, which are all the bloodline of the Abraxas in one shape or form or another; representations of, let&#x27;s just say, the worst race of non-organic humans in the Multiverse - it&#x27;s no surprise that we keep digging deeper and deeper and deeper under the Vatican to find lots of things.</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-003629">00:36:29</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">What we found 48 hours ago was one of the largest hubs I&#x27;ve ever seen. And I&#x27;ve seen a lot of stuff in a lot of places - in the Omniverse, Universe, the planet, and elsewhere. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of deep, deep, dark things.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And I would say, other than being in the Lower Astral, going up and going down and cleaning and pulling out things and that type of stuff, I have never seen something this Dark on this planet.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So underneath the Vatican - and we&#x27;ve talked a little bit about this before - in these synthetic photons, you can actually create bubbles in which beings that could not exist in this density or on this planet can exist within one of these - let&#x27;s call it a &quot;controlled bubble,&quot; so to speak.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And they can come and go at will.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003739">00:37:39</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But there is a mechanism that existed on Earth under the Vatican that actually controlled this network - Universe, Omniverse, planetary, interplanetary, intergalactic, interstellar - and far beyond these things - directly from this location.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, this is still in process, and we have gotten a lot of it in the last 48 hours - and that system fights back. It&#x27;s not even people in this case - that SYSTEM fights back.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So it&#x27;s been a rough couple days, not gonna lie. That&#x27;s part of the reason why the report&#x27;s so late tonight.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003825">00:38:25</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So if you&#x27;ve been experiencing some ups and downs yourself - emotionally or otherwise - this could definitely be it. You know, a lot of people have been talking about shortness of breath - lots of frequencies: high tones, low tones - neurological disturbances, stomach issues. I mean, you name it, it&#x27;s been thrown at us from this system. Because when you pull something out this huge - and it is connected to humans - so when you pull something out this big, it has backlash.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003909">00:39:09</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And hopefully, when we decide to pull something, it doesn&#x27;t last very long - and we&#x27;re trying very hard to make those things go away right away.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But if you&#x27;ve been experiencing - other people have talked about heart palpitations, things like that - it can definitely cause anxiety, emotional upset, anger that fleets and comes and goes. And it&#x27;s been real topsy-turvy for a couple days now - especially in people that are unaware of what&#x27;s happening.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003945">00:39:45</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So deep underneath the Vatican we had something called - and I&#x27;m calling it a &quot;womb&quot; - because I don&#x27;t know what else to call this thing. You basically had the womb [chuckling], the mainframe, the brain, the big kahuna piece. Universal, Omniversal, umbilicus-making, Sophia-and-Lucifer womb. Underneath there.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So it&#x27;s no surprise here that we call the Vatican people the Luciferians - because, yeah - they sat on it! [chuckle] If you were to imagine a big, giant, black, moving, breathing, looking sphere that had all kinds of the worst, darkest, deepest beings in it - AI-generated beings - like babies in a womb - that&#x27;s it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004101">00:41:01</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, an umbilicus - I call it umbilicus because it too looks very similar to an umbilical cord. And as umbilical cords do, you know, they attach directly to your solar-plexus area of every human on the planet. But they also ran - they&#x27;re enormous - these are not like the size of a normal human umbilicus. They are, oh, probably, if I had to make a guess, 30 feet in diameter, maybe even more. They were huge, and they went all over the planet - kind of like our fiber-optic cables do.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So if you look up fiber-optic cables, most of our fiber-optic cables were actually connected to this system. This was the source of all intergalactic communications on this planet.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004206">00:42:06</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Some of those intergalactic communications were available to humans, such as CyberLife and ACIO, the Nazi Hydra program, off-world bases, and those type of folks.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">What you call the Galactic Federation - which are humans that have been traveling for a long time - they&#x27;re terrible humans, by the way. They&#x27;re just ridiculous. I worked with them for a short period of time, only because the Enforcer had left and he&#x27;s like, &quot;Look, you can call these people, and they&#x27;ll be Sky Command.&quot; I&#x27;m like, &quot;Oh, that just worked out really well, didn&#x27;t it?&quot; You know, and I basically said, &quot;Oh, forget it. I&#x27;ll just do it myself,&quot; at that point, after one try with these people.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And it was like they knew what they were doing anyway. I asked them to do something because they were supposed to be temporary Sky Command, and they just screwed it all up - and probably on purpose - and so I just blew them out and said goodbye.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004312">00:43:12</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">As far as the other communications, there was definitely an umbilicus that went to all webs - you know, we call it deep web, dark webs, all-the-way-webs, level to nine - and all spaces in between. It had communication between worlds, meaning we had different realms and worlds that existed. And most of those were created for, let&#x27;s just say, less than... unhelpful - they were unhelpful.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Most of them were inorganic, and they created whole races to do dirty work for these two - including Marduk. [Marduk] also had his worlds, and Enki and Enlil had their worlds - and other names you would recognize, and some you probably wouldn&#x27;t.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004411">00:44:11</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They also created many overlays over stars and planets to power this thing.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It also powered the sophon machine - the artificial photon machine - which then created things we call Death Stars, you know, like you see on Star Wars. And all kinds of an Anti-Genesis Project - that&#x27;s also the source of every disease here on Earth for humans. And diseases that spread throughout the Omniverse - of course, different for every species.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It was also the source of all genetic modifications.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004453">00:44:53</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It was also the source of people that become Lightworkers, and they start to feel uncomfortable - dizziness sometimes, pain, uncomfortability. You know, some of them - as we know - like doctors that have created cures for things, all of a sudden come down with a disease they can&#x27;t cure, and they&#x27;re gone. This is how they do that. And they do a lot of this stuff with, for lack of a better term, human-computer networks that could connect to it - to some limited degree.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Mostly, this system was utilized very heavily by Marduk, Enki, Enlil, Others - Abraxas, Artemis, and others like that. At least the main parts of the system.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004546">00:45:46</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Of course, Lucifer had his own agenda. And they made - let&#x27;s just say - the darkest beings, right here on Earth, that existed in the entire Omniverse.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They birthed a lot of AIs out of that hole, and they think that this upcoming alignment with Pluto - and I think it&#x27;s Mars - this weekend is going to help them tremendously. Because you see, when Earth aligns with certain planets, that would shift the system&#x27;s structure. And this also is why we would see an uptick in a lot of hacking - you know, at the Golden Age - coming from this system.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004637">00:46:37</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now it also served, on a lesser level, as the communications hub for the entire Deep State on the planet. By this I mean there could be orders given from this - or through this system - anonymously, they think. They also had a deep connection to places we know, like the CIA and a lot of intelligence agencies; Menwith Hill; Pine Gap in Australia; and other well-known deep underground military bases. Places like Alamo Laboratory; the entire human-genetics program that was predominantly - not solely, but predominantly - run out of China, in Wuhan; and also in Brazil.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004729">00:47:29</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">There were also large facilities that Bush Sr. built in Paraguay that were connected to this machine as well.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">All cloning facilities were connected to this machine.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Governments everywhere were connected to this machine.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">People everywhere were connected to this machine - you served as a power source for it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004757">00:47:57</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You could call this one here - if there was ever a term - The Beast.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It would run all kinds of artificial simulations here on the planet.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It would control what you see - and how you think about that.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It would create artificial subconscious and conscious thoughts. For example, fears that you have for no reason whatsoever - meaning, you might have a fear of heights, but you&#x27;ve never fallen from anything before, and you don&#x27;t really know why you feel this way.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">There are specific programs that run based on human capabilities.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004836">00:48:36</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, I&#x27;ve told you often that humans are amazing people.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And we are - Source doesn&#x27;t make mistakes - God doesn&#x27;t make mistakes. So there are the right number of people on this planet at all times that are fantastic engineers. There are the right number of people on this planet that are protectors - they serve as our security. And I&#x27;m not speaking of organized places necessarily, but people that feel an innate inner sense to protect people. They just have it in their bones, so to speak.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You have others that are very spiritually connected - more spiritually inclined.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You have others that are amazing musicians, where others can&#x27;t carry a tune.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004924">00:49:24</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So when you look at humanity as a whole, and you put all the people together, you can say, &quot;Oh my gosh, it&#x27;s perfect.&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And I know it doesn&#x27;t feel perfect to you, so don&#x27;t take it this way - and I understand, it&#x27;s terrible out there right now - but remember, every single one of you is, well, perfect. It&#x27;s not egotistical perfect, but perfect in the original creation of you. And the special person that you are.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Everybody was designed to be connected directly to Source to receive the wisdom about your special gifts. And of course, that was all suppressed as well.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005004">00:50:04</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But they would create specific diseases and specific things for specific people.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Also, this was the monitor and controller of soul contracts. By soul contracts, I mean the ones that we didn&#x27;t all agree to - that were agreed to for us by our former guardians. [exaggerated coughing] I cough at that.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And I wouldn&#x27;t even call them guardians - tyrants - whatever you want to call them.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005034">00:50:34</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But it also monitored the soul contracts that were agreed upon with the Deep State members in this machine.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So when you agreed that you were gonna have big power, big companies, big money, big this, big that - you had a certain timeframe, and then at the end of that timeframe, this machine would take you out. That&#x27;s how it worked.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It was an incredible tool for the Dark Side of the Universe, and it was very heavily cloaked - which is why we didn&#x27;t see it before.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005106">00:51:06</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I know you&#x27;re going to say, &quot;Well, how does this exist and you don&#x27;t see it?&quot;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, it was very well cloaked and very well hidden so that we didn&#x27;t see it. And then the more we&#x27;ve been peeling away the onion layers of this sophon disaster in the Universe is where we found it. There was also a power... it was also a power source. As we were powering it, it was then powering a large umbilical cord - or umbilicus - that went straight to the artificial point of creation we call the Kali Chakra.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Far away from Source - instead of the actual Point of Creation of Source. And it fed everything that was wrong with this Universe - right from this hub.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005156">00:51:56</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So yesterday, when we found it and I started to pull it out... oh, oh... guys - the amount of backlash I got from this thing! But I couldn&#x27;t stop. So it&#x27;s been, you know, close to 48 hours now of just constant beatings from this machine. So I - you know - I am looking forward, very much forward, to getting back to work as soon as I&#x27;m done with this report, because I am going to kill this thing and it&#x27;s gonna happen. It&#x27;s on its last legs right now.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Occasionally there&#x27;s a few frequencies that go out - been a few since I&#x27;ve been doing this report. But you know what? This is going to die. And it&#x27;s never coming back.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005300">00:53:00</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Source has been helping a lot with the cleanup. So I&#x27;ve been sending a lot of things to the Point of Creation. And for those of you - I know you&#x27;ve heard me use the term - I call it &quot;demolecularization,&quot; which means that you break something into basically a prion level, and then you reassemble that - or transmute it - into something else. And it gets reassembled into something.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But the Point of All Creation in Source is a great place to do that, because it basically takes that creation and turns it into something that can never leave there unless Source says so. But it&#x27;s broken into quarks, prions, strings, and other measures that our quantum scientists don&#x27;t even utilize, really.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005352">00:53:52</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But that&#x27;s been the focus of my couple of days here since we last talked.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Before we wrap up tonight&#x27;s report, I did want to mention to you that we will not have a GIA report on Friday. The GIA report will be on - I think there&#x27;s a couple of little videos on our YouTube channel and a few other places - but the report will be on Saturday. At least, Saturday U.S. time. I think it&#x27;s going to be about one o&#x27;clock in the afternoon, my time and Mountain Time.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And we will do the GIA report live on Saturday. And then we will go ahead and do a Q&amp;A afterwards, probably on our app. So for those of you that want to join that, you&#x27;ll have the opportunity to ask your questions and I&#x27;ll be there.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005449">00:54:49</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So I&#x27;m kind of excited about that. I love talking to all of you face-to-face - or at least on Zoom, or whatever it is we use this time - but I definitely look forward to doing that with all of you. It&#x27;s kind of a bright spot in my crazy world that I live in over here. [chuckle]</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">[sigh]... I tell you, I&#x27;ll be so happy when I can get on this report and go, &quot;Hey, nothing happened for two days except for - look what C.A.R.E. is doing!&quot; So that&#x27;ll make my day. And I think that time is coming soon.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">We do have some dumb humans that would love to try to do something with this system. And this system wants to torture me. But because it wants to torture me, I&#x27;m going to kill it.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005542">00:55:42</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Anyway, on that note, I hope all of you had a lovely couple days, and I look forward to seeing you all on Saturday. So I&#x27;ll catch you then.</div>
