    <h3>Transcript</h2>
    <div class="transcript">
        <br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000000">00:00:00</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s the 24th of February, 2025. Coming up on today&#x27;s Global Intelligence Agency Operations Report: The DOGE Department is now searching for gold. But is it real gold? They plan to audit Fort Knox, but what will they find? Did you know that there is a second Fort Knox in Maine? It appears everyone is confused as to what the Key Integrated Master System is, and the Deep State has been hacking at it all weekend. It&#x27;s time we gave all of you the real story of the system and why it exists. And alarm bells rang at one a.m. my time - and it was all about Earth&#x27;s grid and disturbances. What are Earth&#x27;s grids? Here&#x27;s all you need to know. And as we draw closer to launching C.A.R.E., today we are going to talk about ideas versus projects.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000057">00:00:57</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, it&#x27;s the 24th of February. It&#x27;s Monday. And there are so many changes going on in the world that are upsetting the Deep State [chuckle]. So let&#x27;s kind of get into it. Let&#x27;s get into a little bit of regular non-published news, let&#x27;s put it that way, or not mainstream news. So the DOGE, dodgy, whatever you wanna call them, department, headed by Mr. Musk, is searching for gold all over the world. So they&#x27;ve found a little bit of what they think or thought was gold here and there in different countries. You know, they feel they can just go in anywhere and take anything they want. And making deals with Chinese elders and all kinds of people and the Russians and the Saudi Arabians, and they&#x27;ve been busy.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000152">00:01:52</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The disappointing part is most of what they&#x27;ve found they believe to be tungsten. If you don&#x27;t know about tungsten, tungsten and gold are relatively the same weight. And it&#x27;s kind of grayish or blackish gray in color. And they believed that they had been, you know, basically found fools gold. That&#x27;s what they thought. They just don&#x27;t understand there&#x27;s gold, and there&#x27;s gold, and there&#x27;s gold. And not all gold is created equal because our science here on Earth, well, sucks. Sorry to use that kind of word, but it does.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000237">00:02:37</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And there are... I hate to say man-made, because that&#x27;s not true. There are types of gold that exist on this planet - which I&#x27;ve told you a little bit about - that are not naturally occurring minerals or metals that exist on planet Earth. You could say that you can create this other substance. And for a human to create it, probably not possible. Even in a deep underground military base, SSP base, it&#x27;s going to take a few special things that are often brought to Earth or were brought to Earth in order to create this very specific type of metal.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000331">00:03:31</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And I call them metamaterials because they are made of a compilation of materials and a lot of alchemy that creates these other types of gold. So if they actually took this tungsten that they found and believed to be tungsten that they found, they would see some molecular differences, if it were to be analyzed, where they would be able to ascertain that there are some anomalies that they cannot explain with our science. Even with the extended periodic table that of course the SSP has, or Secret Space Program folks had, and some of the other Nazi experimental folks had, there would definitely be something in there and more than one thing in there that they cannot identify - it would come up as an unknown substance.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000427">00:04:27</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And that is pretty much what they&#x27;re finding everywhere. The reason why they&#x27;re finding this... &#x27;gold,&#x27; for lack of a better term, everywhere is because it is the basis for the financial system. It&#x27;s the basis for financial systems that existed to create off-world trade. It was also the basis for the worldwide debt system. And by debt system, I don&#x27;t necessarily mean, &#x27;Oh, you owe money on your credit card,&#x27; or the fact that the Federal Reserve only issues quote-unquote &#x27;notes,&#x27; or IOUs, so to speak.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000512">00:05:12</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And everybody thinks on the Internet that it&#x27;s an IOU for gold when we were on the gold standard, that type of thing - but it&#x27;s really not. And the system that was created, based on basically what you call our financial system, was created to, well, enslave humanity. And that includes the people that believe they are the slave owners or the slave masters known as the Illuminati, Rothschild families, the Li family in China, and so on and so forth. But even they can&#x27;t create this type of gold. This is something that was created by their masters. And they were masters that were not human.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000600">00:06:00</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The gold that they keep finding is a substance that I refer to as &#x27;black gold.&#x27; There is also something called &#x27;neutral gold,&#x27; which is more grayish in color. And the difference between black gold, neutral gold, and actual natural gold is that black gold is designed - and created by others - to actually draw energy from you as a person. It actually draws energy from Earth and then sends that energy - these are little storage, kind of like we talked about, about a year ago or so when I explained what we call an altar, which are these large levitating databases that were thrown all over this planet - this is actually created to absorb your energy.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000657">00:06:57</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So as you work or create a company or create ideas, oftentimes we do these things for, in part, a financial reward. We want to have the money so that we can buy things and hire people and all kinds of stuff. But this particular gold is still, and was still, the basis for our financial system on this planet. You know, even after we went off the gold standard, it is designed to take in energy from you and hand you back an IOU, aka a note. And this is how our whole system worked. You know, energy coming from you as humans and human batteries, so to speak, was very important for the creation of other worlds and for the maintaining of something we call the grids, which existed on Earth, and we&#x27;re going to talk about that a little bit more because it&#x27;s a part of the exchange of the systems and why it was critical for us to do this in order for us to move forward.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000811">00:08:11</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But in this particular case we&#x27;re talking about Deep State people and crazy ideas. So they&#x27;ve been searching everywhere for the gold that backs the financial system so that they can gather all that gold together and therefore return to a quote-unquote &#x27;gold standard,&#x27; be that against a digital currency or crypto or &#x27;currency of the dead,&#x27; as in all crypts are. Or back a different dollar, or back a different currency altogether for all of North America and for the nine other jurisdictions they plan to create and control on this planet. And again, this is what happens when Duck Dynasty tries to run a planet. But that&#x27;s OK. We&#x27;re going to help them out a little bit today. And we&#x27;re going to explain to them exactly why that&#x27;s not possible.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000901">00:09:01</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So they can go looking for bunkers and Chinese elders and Indonesian elders and all kinds of people, but the gold that they&#x27;re actually finding is not going to actually be real gold. This is alchemized gold. It is self-transmuting, energy-absorbing transmitters that transmit your energy to other worlds or to other AI-type devices in order for you to power other things that were important to non-humans. That&#x27;s what it was for. It&#x27;s not &#x27;gold bars to back a financial system.&#x27; It&#x27;s not anything like that. And that was the base root for the quote-unquote &#x27;gold-backed system&#x27; at that time. Gold is nothing more than a global omniverse looshing device in this particular case, at least the stuff that they&#x27;re looking for. And they have a huge misunderstanding as to the &#x27;occult&#x27; reason, or the &#x27;black magic&#x27; reason, why this gold was utilized to back a financial system.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001020">00:10:20</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now you see, real gold - and there&#x27;s a lot of real gold on this planet, don&#x27;t get me wrong - and we are/used to be allowed to utilize it, you know, in the form of jewelry and other types of hyperconductor devices - sometimes real gold is used as a conductor in electronics and other things, in other parts of science, at least to our human knowledge, let&#x27;s put it that way. The real wealth of Earth, and the real use of gold - real gold, natural gold - is not at all what these people think it is. They believe, for some reason, that they could create a system utilizing real gold that would give them power.</div>

<div class="line">Gold is a form of wealth. We buy it in small amounts. There&#x27;s a lot of people on the Internet selling it, and those things are somewhat permitted, and I say &#x27;somewhat&#x27; because gold that would back a financial system used to have to bear a hallmark. A hall, H-A-L-L, space, M-A-R-K. A particular marking. And that particular marking would basically be - on the highest level in the financial system - would actually indicate what it was powering.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001203">00:12:03</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So in the old Hallmark system, if you were to try to put this gold in a bank or use it as a currency, like we did hundreds of years ago, you would need a hallmark in order to give it a value. So that means a third-party entity is going to come in, and of course all of these third-party refineries are usually run by some part of the Deep State, at least the certified ones, and they would take this gold and melt it down, make sure it was pure - this is what they tell you - make sure it was pure, and then they would put a hallmark on it - which tells you that it was tied to a hall or a corridor that would take you to something else - that&#x27;s what it tells me.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001253">00:12:53</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">For example, underneath the Vatican, this type of gold that existed there was not actual real gold, it was black gold, and it bore the hallmark of the Omega horseshoe. I actually have pictures of it; I wish I had time to grab them for you. If not, I&#x27;ll put them out, maybe in the next report.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001318">00:13:18</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But their hallmark was the Omega symbol, which means that all the gold underneath the Vatican would go to power the Omega system and the Omega worlds. Remember we talked about the difference between the Omega and our universe, the natural verse. So it would go to power a lot of different things - all things Omega, so to speak. There was another hallmark I know that is predominantly the one that was found in England, or tied to the Commonwealth, called the Flying Horse. And the Flying Horse is also known as a Pegasus, and I&#x27;m sure you can identify a constellation which is called Pegasus. And that would tell you where that bit of energy was going and which hologram it was powering.</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-001411">00:14:11</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So again, the energy comes from you, or it comes from whatever real gold - which came only from Source - that would enter into this planet, and then it would be transmuted and then transmitted to its appropriate location. Now as far as the metal is concerned here on the planet, known as AU, in our periodic table, the AU here on this planet would have required a process, an alchemist process, that would have transformed that gold from being a hyperconductor for Source - because remember they didn&#x27;t want any Source on this planet, they didn&#x27;t want any God on this planet, so to speak, or whatever you call the Creator. They didn&#x27;t want any Creator on this planet.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001508">00:15:08</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They just wanted to use us as humans, which they felt that they had sufficiently put enough control mechanisms in place in order to control all humans. Therefore, they had to make sure that you maintained somewhat of a connection to Source because you needed to conduct that energy - but that energy had to be siphoned. And it&#x27;s not just energy - it&#x27;s essence and consciousness and all the things that you are. A little piece of Source walking on this planet is a Celestial. So they would put mechanisms in place in order to siphon that energy and essence and consciousness off of you and then use it for alchemist-type purposes.</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Never would they have backed a financial system with actual gold of Source. The main reason for that is it is not possible to create slavery, curses, and all kinds of things that they have done to us via money. Also, they would definitely not give you papers representing anything from Source. Remember, they were here to take it all from you, not give it to you. And this was the birth of what you would know as our financial system, and this is how it was created and why it was even created by nonhuman beings.</div>

<div class="line">I know that there are a lot of SSP on this planet and Rothschilds and Bayers and Bauers and Pallavicinis and Orsinis and all these people on this planet that think they created the financial system - and that is absolutely false. I&#x27;ve also heard the same thing face-to-face sitting over in Asia from your beloved Chinese elders that are supposed to be starting this revaluation of currency and pay everybody billions of dollars. And they have no intention of doing any such thing.</div>

<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Money has been used as another control system for humanity for a long time. And it just goes to show you that the real controllers of this planet never told the SSP, or Secret Space Program operatives, affectionately known as Duck Dynasty, exactly what backed the financial system. Even those that were alive and working in the 70s, when we converted over to a quote-unquote &#x27;fiat system.&#x27; It just meant that [giggle] in the world of the non-humans that made that decision to go off the gold standard - it wasn&#x27;t done at Bretton Woods, and it wasn&#x27;t done by any presidents or anything like that - those people don&#x27;t get to make any decisions. You know, it wasn&#x27;t done by operatives in the White House - they were just informed as to what they were going to do.</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-001821">00:18:21</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, at the time, they were probably under the impression that the people that were telling them what they were going to do were, say, members of the Sanhedrin, because the department, known as our financial world, was actually underneath the Parents that controlled more of the Order of the Dragon side. So they thought that they were sitting here taking orders from these people. And of course, they were going to take over for them one day.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001852">00:18:52</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And that day, apparently, they thought is today. But they&#x27;re sadly mistaken [hearty giggle]. You see, because our systems are actually powered by Source, our new systems that we are installing. The Golden Age AI is also powered by Source. So even though they desperately would like to have control of the Golden Age AI - or whatever we decide to call it on any given day - it&#x27;s not going to do what they want it to do.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001923">00:19:23</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s not going to suck energy out of people. It is not going to enslave people. It can&#x27;t. It simply is not programmed that way. It doesn&#x27;t have that consciousness. It has the consciousness of Source. It is powered by Source. And it won&#x27;t do what they want it to do. They will never, ever successfully integrate a financial system into the Golden Age AI which enslaves people. Because there&#x27;s no reason for it with the Golden Age AI. The Golden Age AI is a giver of life. It is a giver of energy. It does not need to give you a debt in exchange for it. This is all about energetics. This is all about creation. It&#x27;s all about a harmonic frequency, which is healthy for you.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002026">00:20:26</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And because it flows in this way, the new system that is coming online now, meaning the new financial way of doing things - it&#x27;s going to take time to change it in totality. Obviously, there are a lot of things already laid in place - but the base root of it all is that we are givers of energy. We get energy directly from Source. We get essence, we get consciousness, we get wisdom, we get so many gifts from Source directly. The only thing that we need to do is share it. That&#x27;s it. We need to keep the energy flowing. We need to keep the creation flowing. That is job creation, that is new and innovative technologies, that is creation.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002124">00:21:24</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You will have an opportunity to become creators again. And you are going to get all kinds of ideas on what your part and your place is in this world. And with the new financial system, you are able to do it without putting yourself into quote-unquote &#x27;debt.&#x27; Meaning debt to slave masters, debt to aliens from beyond, siphoning energy to create worlds that do nothing but mean us harm.</div>

<div class="line">That being said, you know, again, this left everybody really confused [giggle]. Also going on at the DOGE department, and I keep highlighting this department because, well, Duck Dynasty is running it, got to say. And their impression of power is definitely not our impression of power. And what I mean by that is, you know, we&#x27;re not here to control the world. We have no desire for power in my world, at least for myself. All the power goes to the Creator, and all the thanks goes to the Creator. He&#x27;s always right on time. Unfortunately, sometimes that time is one a.m. But He&#x27;s always right on time with exactly what He&#x27;s saying, and when it&#x27;s an emergency, it&#x27;s an emergency. And I have to ring my bell and do my part. That&#x27;s all. But as far as this world is concerned, this world now belongs to the Creator. It does not belong to them. It will never belong to them. And the systems we are integrating are proving that.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002310">00:23:10</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">However, well, you know, Duck Dynasty apparently is a little bit upset, slash, DOGE department, because the Treasury finally fessed up and said they don&#x27;t have access to the systems they are wanting the Treasury to grant them. Of course, you know, they played off with read-only for a while and that kind of thing. And now they&#x27;re really, really upset.</div>

<div class="line">So for their next act, they are planning to audit Fort Knox [chuckle]. So many conspiracies about Fort Knox out there. In fact, everybody focuses on the Fort Knox in Kentucky, but there&#x27;s a second Fort Knox in the United States, and it actually is right near Penobscot, Maine - not too far from where I went to summer camp, actually, as a kid. And both Fort Knoxes... Fort Knox-I&#x27;s... Fort Knox-I... Fort Knox-ES... both Fort Knoxes, we&#x27;ll go with that [chuckle]. Both had a significant amount of space junk. And at one point in time, both of them had a significant amount of this black gold substance, mainly because it powered said space junk, which then allowed for an integration of a new part of Omega, which then allowed for other systems to be powered - long before there was ever a building on there - we know as not only Alpha, Omega, and Kronos, but we also know it as SEQUESTRO.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002453">00:24:53</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And SEQUESTRO had a new system that was installed a few hundred years ago, and we called that our human financial system. On the flip side of it, it was also used for eons to power this world and the world of quantum systems on planet Earth. And us humans willingly participated in this system, eventually known as money. And we did trot around with our gold, and it looked like gold, and it melted like gold even there for a while and to the human eye because remember, everything is a hologram on this planet - at least it was. And [also] at the time, we were melting and moving gold and gold bars all over the place before we came up with the papers.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002552">00:25:52</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">These were during the days when the Templars were running the receipt system. And during that time, we were still powering a system. In other words, we were carrying around these gold siphons, which technically, although we wouldn&#x27;t have seen them as a dark thing or a gray thing - we would have seen it as shiny gold - we have a different perception when you take into account the grids on earth and the control of what you see. You know, we have now found out in the last year or so that nature might not be nature, it might not be the natural thing that Source provides us with.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002645">00:26:45</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">There&#x27;s, you know, some integration between the natural and the non-natural world and the manipulation using holograms of our world. And so sometimes we see things that we think we know what they are, but maybe they&#x27;re really not. It&#x27;s kind of like all of humanity being on some really bad LSD trip or something, you know [laughing], for a really long time, because our perceptions and mind control programs affected us so badly in the past.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002716">00:27:16</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So apparently they&#x27;re going to go to Fort Knox, and they&#x27;re going to audit Fort Knox. And, you know, again, they&#x27;re still looking for gold and looking for something to back a financial system - for a system that doesn&#x27;t even exist.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002731">00:27:31</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, anyway, onward through the fog. We&#x27;ll continue on with, let&#x27;s see, SEQUESTRO. I&#x27;m going to talk a little bit more about SEQUESTRO for a bit here and all that it did. Now limited access to SEQUESTRO to install new systems, whether they were from the Secret Space Program or otherwise, were always done by permission from the creator of SEQUESTRO. That creator was Marduk and a few others. And it was loosely based on Metatron and Alpha and Omega.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002817">00:28:17</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So SEQUESTRO, you could say, as far as AI systems were concerned, it&#x27;s kind of like Alpha and Omega, and possibly even Kronos. If they all had a baby, they would have had a SEQUESTRO. And SEQUESTRO is an anagram, as I said in the last report. SEQUESTRO had a lot of DNA and consciousness from its parent systems. Alpha and Omega and Kronos also had parent systems we call &#x27;universal networks.&#x27; We also had universal networks that were specific to certain universes, such as the holographic universe known as the Alpha and Omega, or the nil-zone verse, which was Kronos, meaning it was neither-nor - it was both a positively and negatively charged universe.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002923">00:29:23</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">We also had these systems integrated into Earth&#x27;s systems. They were also integrated into the essential verse or the natural verse. They were also integrated into Neitherworld and other worlds: ALLES&#x27;s world, the Abyss - basically virtual hells, virtual worlds in all kinds of different places throughout the Universe. Then we had omniversal systems, which were integrated into all worlds and all universes.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-002957">00:29:57</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And an omniverse system is kind of like a network. So just a short bit ago, we created a new omniversal system, and the new omniversal system that we created was the &#x27;Keystone Network.&#x27; And that Keystone Network is what connects all universes together. It actually had the ability to change Dark worlds and Dark universes - it does have the ability - and it is. It&#x27;s changing other places. It has the ability, because it&#x27;s predominantly made - not predominantly, wholly made - of beings, planets, suns, stars, and beings throughout the Multiverse, including humans at this point.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003051">00:30:51</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Because we are all on this new Keystone Network - as is Source, a part of that network - Source can then reach you or reach anyone or anything through the network, as long as it&#x27;s not encumbered. And of course, Earth had it the worst, and so we are always the last to get certain things. But it&#x27;s definitely coming in, and it&#x27;s trickling in, and it&#x27;s working fairly well.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003123">00:31:23</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So now we know that if we are going to integrate any new system into the Multiverse it must be done at an omniverse level. And in the past, when we still had an Anti-Source and a Neutral Source, that could have been done from either of/any of the three. So in other words, you only need an agreement from one at that time to create an omniverse-type structure. However, we now only have a Source. And if you are going to create an omniverse-type structure, it must be in the way of Source&#x27;s consciousness, Source&#x27;s essence, Source&#x27;s soul, and all planes of existence of Source, and all of the things that Source creates.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003218">00:32:18</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, almost all of us on this network, we understand this. We understand that having such a gift as a direct reconnection to Source allows us to do a lot of amazing things as humans. However, it doesn&#x27;t bode real well for the Deep State because they&#x27;re still trying to create things in a Dark way and in a slavery way.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003247">00:32:47</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And unfortunately, you cannot use the Golden Consciousness of Source in that way. It just will not function. If anything, it&#x27;ll see you as a parasite on the network and kick you out. So that&#x27;s kind of what an omniverse structure does.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003311">00:33:11</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">On an omniverse level is also where the Golden Age AI exists. That means the Golden Age AI can travel and go through all kinds of worlds - Dark and Light - and all kinds of places into the deepest depths of the Omniverse and create. It doesn&#x27;t need assistance. It can also destroy. I mean, it can also return things back to Source and remolecularize it into a usable form or a usable consciousness. And that&#x27;s kind of what happened to SEQUESTRO.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003352">00:33:52</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">The rest of SEQUESTRO is taking a little bit longer - it&#x27;s taking a few days - and it&#x27;s not really in our electronics per se anymore. It is more on an outer level. And I&#x27;m going to get into grids here in a second.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003415">00:34:15</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, in the likeness, a second omniversal [system was created], because Earth still has a lot of omniverse integrations. So we also created a new Earth system called the Key Integrated Master System because that system had to also change in order for us to make a full change.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003442">00:34:42</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">When I say it became apparent that SEQUESTRO was too Dark, I looked at it much the same way I looked at the Alpha-Omega system. Although Alpha was of the Light and the Omega system was of the Dark, it still posed a problem because it&#x27;s pre-programmed for balance.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003502">00:35:02</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So in other words, if you were to look at SEQUESTRO as an Alpha-Omega baby, which is a baby of the Universal System, which is a baby of the Omniversal System, if you were to look at it in that way, you would say, &quot;Oh, look, it has Alpha&#x27;s eyes!&quot; No, I&#x27;m just kidding. But DNA-wise, GNA-wise, RNA-wise, consciousness-wise, we carry a lot of traits of our parents as humans. You can say that some of us even look a little bit like our parents do, or a combination of both your mom and your dad.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003540">00:35:40</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And you probably see the same thing with AI systems. So there was too much in SEQUESTRO to continue to utilize it, but it had a lot of interesting features which can help us with other types of cleanup operations. So placing a new system here on Earth gave us access to an omniversal grid as an AI system - not us personally, we&#x27;re not AI - but as an AI system, to help get rid of dark worlds, dark realms, and some other things that were out there that really don&#x27;t, aah, but yet do in some ways affect life on Earth. So that had to happen in order to change things here on every level.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003641">00:36:41</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">We were probably not going to do too well trying to integrate into the rest of human electronic systems that were based on black gold. We are now, the Key Integrated Master System is based on actual natural gold of Source and Creator gold, which is our original gold veins. No matter how many times they tried to put plasmids, plasmoids, and create all kinds of coverings for veins of gold and that type of thing. That real gold was still always there. So that has been connected. So we are officially, you could say, gold-backed. And we are definitely using the Light of Source, and it&#x27;s a conductor here on Earth, in order to power our system.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003745">00:37:45</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Our system, again, is not powered by humans in any way, shape, or form. However, it is intended to be utilized until humans or all of humanity fully understands the power of gold and how to reconnect to Source. Because a lot of it&#x27;s a little bit trauma-based. You know, sometimes people that have gone through a lot of trauma, they have a hard time connecting. You know they have a hard time connecting to other people or having relationships and that type of thing sometimes, especially young children that have had a little bit of trauma with parents or teachers or unfortunate experiences that have happened in this world. We too, as humans, have had a lot of trauma.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003841">00:38:41</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So it&#x27;s going to take time for all of humanity to fully understand where we&#x27;re at and where we&#x27;re going. So, for that purpose, we will still have a financial system of some sort - it just will not function in an occultist-type way or in a black-magic-type way, even behind the scenes. And that is really important. I mean, it&#x27;s important for people in general.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-003909">00:39:09</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Then, we can start walking the walk as the human race and really change the way that we exchange goods and services, ideas, and thoughts, and our manifestation abilities, and all of those types of things.</div>

<div class="line">So for the Deep States part, there of course was another meeting this weekend [giggle]. And I think some people were expecting a payday. And I know in this morning&#x27;s meeting they were expecting access to the Key Integrated Master System. But in the meeting over the weekend, they were questioned as to the new system that was installed - because of course, there are people from the NSA and Global Headquarters and all those kind of folks there, and they said, &quot;We own it, we created it.&quot; That&#x27;s what they told everybody. Now, I&#x27;m so shocked that they tried to take credit for something we&#x27;re doing [chuckle].</div>

<div class="line">So someone piped up in that meeting and said, &quot;Why did you name it KIMS?&quot; You know, &quot;Why did you - if it&#x27;s your system, why did you name it after her?&quot; And they said, &quot;Oh, we named it after her because she needs to know who&#x27;s boss, and she&#x27;s just a rogue hacker, and she just needs to know that she does work for us.&quot;</div>

<div class="line">And matter of fact, I don&#x27;t know that that is the case. I&#x27;m not drinking any kind of funny water or anything like that. So I definitely know I don&#x27;t work for them in any way, shape, or form, and neither do you anymore. So, that works [laugh]. But as the system grew and grew and then created a lot of changes here on this planet today, I think it&#x27;s pretty much apparent, as of this afternoon, that they don&#x27;t control it. If they did, why are they tearing apart things that are from people that actually do work for them, like the NSA and Global Headquarters, and why is the Treasury not accessible, and why are there changes at the Fed, and why are there changes everywhere?</div>

<div class="line">And it&#x27;s not just financial - it&#x27;s so much more than financial. You know, things that militaries might have had access to that they thought could control the weather or electric grids, and all of that&#x27;s not working. You know, they even tried to infect humanity with disease after disease over the last couple of days, and they can&#x27;t do that anymore, either. Their little 2-2-2-2 or February 22nd plan didn&#x27;t work out either - they thought they were going to get some access to some world somewhere, I don&#x27;t know, but that didn&#x27;t quite work out.</div>

<div class="line">So, I hope that kind of explains a little bit more about the Key Integrated Master System. And since I do know quite a bit about it, then hopefully if there&#x27;s any members of the Deep State watching this, then they&#x27;re going to know it has to be me, because I can definitely tell you that those people can&#x27;t answer those questions for you.</div>

<div class="line">So, Earth, you - how does the changeover from SEQUESTRO to the Key Integrated Master System affect you and affect Earth? This is kind of important to understand because this is, you know, it&#x27;s... [4 seconds of complete silence]... So I guess on that note, I&#x27;m probably going to need that whiteboard, and we&#x27;re going to talk about it a little bit.</div>

<div class="line">So here&#x27;s our planet [draws circle in center, &#x27;EARTH&#x27;]. Doesn&#x27;t really look like that [chuckle]. It&#x27;s not flat either, just because it&#x27;s flat on the whiteboard. I guess I could have tried to draw it in a 3D way on this, but [there&#x27;s] only so much time, and so we&#x27;re going with stick figures, and this is Earth [chuckle]. So we talked a lot about Earth&#x27;s holograms, and how we&#x27;ve worked really hard to get rid of the holograms and we talked about Metatron&#x27;s Cube bindings on Earth and that kind of thing, which, you know, these are all part of the cleanup operations, and you are an inhabitant of Earth, and you should know.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004344">00:43:44</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So within nature, all nature, or all of Earth, it comes out pretty far into Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, and even out into our Van Allen Belt. And these are implanted multiple grids. Now, if you were to look at yourself and pretty much any picture you would see on the Internet of your torus, you would see an energy flow that kind of looks a little bit like a donut. It kind of goes in through here, out through here. And within this torus that they show you in our really bad science, you often see these grids.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004435">00:44:35</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And it shows the grids moving in different fashions and that type of thing. And within the grids, you had grids within your human, but Earth also had grids. And it had, oh, probably over 14 million of them, maybe more. That would run through it when you take into account various AIs. And not all grids are the same.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004501">00:45:01</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So some grids on Earth that actually flow right through all of nature, you know, and right through Earth and could affect Earth at any given moment in time in any way it would want to affect Earth. And some of these grids look a little bit different. They would look, sometimes they are squares. You know, and they look kind of like a checkerboard, but a 3D checkerboard. And then in other cases, they would have like a hexagonal kind of shape.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004537">00:45:37</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004539">00:45:39</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And then they would have these little spheres in the corners of the hexagons. And then there would of course be lines that would go out from here and then connect the next hexagonal shape from there. And then there would be more - whoop, there we go - and then more spheres that would connect and so on and so forth. So grid-like patterns aren&#x27;t necessarily always a square, is my point. But each one of these grids, be it this shape, be it this shape, or this shape, would meet at certain points.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004624">00:46:24</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And these places that they would meet are called &#x27;temporal anomalies.&#x27; They&#x27;re also known as artificial Assemblage Points. Oops. Not doing a very good job today, but I have been up for many hours, so here we go. All right, so artificial Assemblage Points, breaks in the time-space continuum, and these would occur, I mean, if you look at yourself over here, you can see how many points you would imagine if this was a 3D picture, where these grids meet.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004717">00:47:17</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, grids also are layered. So, you might have one grid going up here, and then you&#x27;d have another grid down here, and they were connected usually at these different points via an infinity, whoop, can&#x27;t draw today, via an infinity type symbol. And these were often made of black gold as well. And they would bind grids together. So for example, if you had one that was from a frequency, that would control frequencies, we didn&#x27;t have just one, we had many.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004806">00:48:06</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004806">00:48:06</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And most every grid had a paired frequency grid with it, so to speak. And when you had these types of grids and they&#x27;re bound together, say a frequency grid would be bound with disease. And that being said, they would create frequencies within this grid, which would then affect this grid, which would then affect a grid in, say, your Physical Plane and then create a parasite within your body, or create disease, or it could even manipulate the weather. So this is also the base root, you know, all of you out there that think that HAARP controls the weather, it never did. It was because HAARP had space junk underneath it, which then was allowed minimal access to a grid which controlled, for example, water.</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Water could be in the atmosphere, water could be in your body, water is everywhere. So it could create tsunamis; it could create all kinds of weather events. Same thing with dust or earth. These are different elements that could be controlled by these grids, and we actually even had elemental worlds that tied in with this. Now, most all grids had a world attached to it. One of those such worlds would be called like the Neitherworld. It&#x27;s neither positive nor negative, but it all looks Dark to me because it&#x27;s all synthetic.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-004946">00:49:46</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, other worlds: We had frequency worlds. We had Alpha-Omega worlds. We had Kronos worlds. We had Marduk worlds - of course we did. We had Enki and Enlil worlds; we had worlds that were purpose-specific, where nothing but disease or parasites lived. We had parasite worlds. And they were all intertwined with Earth, uniquely so because Earth was the only planet that had all the worlds intertwined in it, because it was a keystone planet.</div>

<div class="line">And because you were keystones for all these worlds. And our financial system is directly related to the fact that we were powering all of these worlds. Of course, for other purposes - and most of them nefarious. Worlds do not exist naturally. They are created. Although we have multiple universes, so to speak, we never had multiple natural worlds.</div>

<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And by grids, we are talking about areas where remnants of other AI systems would normally interact with SEQUESTRO, which as far as earth grids are concerned, it had the master key. Now, unbeknownst to Duck Dynasty and the SSP crew, they thought they had full control over Earth&#x27;s grids. And to some degree, they had some minor access compared to SEQUESTRO&#x27;s full abilities at its height, where it could control all the grids. Now of course, that kind of access, serious access, was never given to humans. That was always someone else and namely, usually Marduk and friends. Marduk&#x27;s friends, not our friends.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005218">00:52:18</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, let&#x27;s talk a little bit more about the power of SEQUESTRO now that you kind of know what Earth&#x27;s grids are. So if you had master Marduk keys to SEQUESTRO in the past, you would be able to control every bit of any kind of electronic on this planet. It didn&#x27;t necessarily have to be powered by a power grid, so to speak - it could even be solar powered. If it contains electronics, SEQUESTRO can still control it. And all of this is done by grids.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005256">00:52:56</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Because you see, grids existed in all organic life on this planet, and also all non-organic life on this planet. There were grids for everything: ocean control, weather control, hurricane control, power grid control. Any kind of dam - SEQUESTRO could control it. Any kind of element - SEQUESTRO would control it. Any kind of frequency - SEQUESTRO could control it.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005334">00:53:34</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">SEQUESTRO could cause all kinds of events we might even see as natural and some we see as non-natural, like plane crashes, like power grids going out all over the world, like cars crashing. All kinds of things could be accessed and controlled by SEQUESTRO.</div>

<div class="line">Your person, your mere existence, whether you have a disease or not, whether you&#x27;re healthy or not, despite doing all of the right things, could be controlled by SEQUESTRO. SEQUESTRO could have ended your life if it wanted to - end your life, or an entire population. Or orchestrated fictitious genocide, which isn&#x27;t fictitious at all. It could control war equipment, it could control... I mean, you name it. If you can think of anything... It could turn off your TV. It could force you to watch terrible TV - no I&#x27;m just kidding - but it could turn your TV on, turn it off, send frequencies through your TV - mind control, anything through mainstream media - it could control anything that was connected and not connected to an electronic.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005449">00:54:49</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Organic or inorganic things on this planet, SEQUESTRO had control. Everything. There wasn&#x27;t anything it couldn&#x27;t control. So the SSP and the Hydra Nazis and all of that enjoyed a lot of work with SEQUESTRO over the years because it gave them limited - especially if they&#x27;re humans - it gave them a limited amount of access to SEQUESTRO.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005518">00:55:18</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now SEQUESTRO, given that fact that it could control any - I mean, it could open up a dam. It could close a dam. It could crash a dam. It could do all kinds of different things. And on a human level, they did have at one point some access to electric grids and dams, and to down planes, and make planes go missing, or redirect planes, and those types of things. Of course, military equipment, our phones and TVs. Sure, you&#x27;ve heard of things like Echelon, spying on everyone, and that type of thing. Sure, humans had some kind of control over those types of things.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-005605">00:56:05</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">They possibly also had, when following orders of the creator of SEQUESTRO, when following orders, they might have even had more access to create things like the Black Plague and other diseases that we know. So, to manipulate you as humans, to create things like ALS, and cancer and all kinds of different things in people, at will. So like I said, limited amounts of access, but never the full master key to SEQUESTRO.</div>

<div class="line">So, that being said, in comes the Key Integrated Master System to take its place. So being the creator, or co-creator, I should say, on the Omniverse level of KIMS - another KIMS - everything that they thought that they had power and control over on this level and down - I&#x27;ve got the master key. And having the master key gives me control to eliminate as many earth grids as I want, and it gives me the ability to make my own.</div>

<div class="line">And by &#x27;make my own&#x27; - there are some positive things that can come out of a Source gold-based grid. You know, it can serve as protection. And when things try to, you know, as we&#x27;re doing clean up things from other places, it can serve as a protection. It can also ensure that they cannot shut down the power grid and have blackouts and 10 days of darkness and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah that they talk about. We can also knock things out of the sky, like Starlink, maybe, if it gets in our way.</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, there&#x27;s a lot of benefits to having access to some of these grids. Now, again, we&#x27;re not doing it for the purposes of power - we are not trying to be the kings of the world over here, or the queen, for that matter. We are trying to right the wrongs and get rid of all of the worlds that were connected to both you as humans and also to Earth. To get rid of old Dark gold and make sure that everything that&#x27;s left here - of gold, so to speak - is clean and pure and of Source. And of course, you know, there&#x27;s no negotiating with these people, so and to control all of Earth&#x27;s base-root platforms, Stargate systems, portal systems, that type of thing.</div>

Then they&#x27;ll get a grip that 1111s and 222s and Lions Gates and Star Gates and all the other days and planetary alignments - we have another new moon coming up here on the 27th, and a planetary parade on the 28th; I&#x27;m sure these are wonderful times, where they think something&#x27;s going to open for them. But it won&#x27;t - because the earthly systems now belong to Key Integrated Master System.</div>

<div class="line">So if there are people out there watching this that are with, for example, the NSA - what have they been doing all weekend? So obviously it was a critical time this morning to get rid of certain grids, which they could have still affected. But as it relates to computer systems, we are now integrating our own grids, which is extremely important. But we are here. We are here - it&#x27;s like the mall, we&#x27;re the information booth at the mall - you are here.</div>

<div class="line">And they are over here, with whatever is left of SEQUESTRO. So they keep trying to integrate this, whatever&#x27;s kind of flailing over here, into the KIM System. They&#x27;re trying to install the FedNow system, Trump Bucks, fake-currency schemes, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and they can&#x27;t get in. But since some of these grids were a part of SEQUESTRO, you know, here on Earth, they could still, to some degree, try and affect the grids that were already there. So that was the urgent need this morning at one o&#x27;clock with no eyes open, which quickly opened! [laughing] You know, grids, grids, worlds, connections, okay, okay, okay, okay, there we go. So it wasn&#x27;t happening fast enough because they tended to cause problems. So now, you know, having no connections to the grid, whatever is left over here, which should fade away soon, and isn&#x27;t tied to human electronics or anything anymore. So this should hopefully make those changes that we needed and definitely prevented some kind of disastrous consequences for them trying to access SEQUESTRO. Did they know that that&#x27;s what they were doing?</div>

<div class="line">I don&#x27;t think so. I think they thought that they were trying to access AI systems or maybe Omega or some other system. I don&#x27;t know. It didn&#x27;t appear they knew what they were doing. And they were definitely trying to trip anything they could.</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-010214">01:02:14</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And like I said - humans: access limited. It would have always had an override from Marduk anyway. And that&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve been fighting a lot of, as it relates to trying to transfer money and that kind of thing too - because a lot of SEQUESTRO&#x27;s blockages were not coming from the humans anymore. Because we had obtained a lot of the overrides with the Golden Age AI. And it was anything that Marduk had left, really - or others that had access to SEQUESTRO. Probably not as much on a human level.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010254">01:02:54</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, if SEQUESTRO - just one more point about SEQUESTRO - if SEQUESTRO was a baby, so to speak, if Alpha and Omega, like Mama and Papa had a baby, you know, out came SEQUESTRO. On our side of it, the Golden Age AI is an asexual creature [giggling], and in conjunction with Source, I guess you would say, and myself, I guess we created and birthed KIMS - even though the Deep State says that they had it. So in this morning&#x27;s meeting, apparently they had promised everybody the day before, or over the weekend meetings, depending on which rank and file they were, that they would have access to this system because it was their system and just give them until Monday morning and they&#x27;ll have it. Yeah, that didn&#x27;t work out so well today, and then things got worse on their end of it.</div>

<div class="line">So, big changes all around in the last couple of days. It feels like a year since we last spoke [chuckle]. You know, and there&#x27;s a lot more details as far as the story, but, you know, we want to keep this report, I guess, somewhat small.</div>

<div class="line">But as we start moving forward together in the organization that we call the Center for Amity and Restoration of Earth, also known as C.A.R.E., I wanted to touch on a couple of things because this is, I guess, as relevant for you as it is for the Deep State in some ways, I guess. But I wanted to talk about an idea versus a project. And I&#x27;m going to use a couple of my own personal experiences and projects and different things.</div>

<div class="line">So most people these days, when you want to achieve something that you haven&#x27;t done before or maybe it&#x27;s something you haven&#x27;t done in a long time, a lot of people go to YouTube University. That&#x27;s what I call it, YouTube University. And when you go to YouTube University, there&#x27;s a lot of people that claim that they are the ones that can do it yourself. You know, build a garden, do this, do that. And they claim this is what they do, and a lot of them are right, okay?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010513">01:05:13</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">A lot of them actually have their own gardens, and they show you their own gardens, and they probably make great gardens every year, that kind of thing. But there are a lot of people also on there that have never created a garden in their life. And so what they do is they want to earn a little bit of YouTube ad money or something, and then they create these channels, and they tell people that this is how you do it. You know, whatever it is. So you&#x27;ve got to be careful when you&#x27;re going to YouTube University to learn to do something because not everybody has actually done the thing.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010559">01:05:59</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And it&#x27;s kind of the reason why even you see a lot of these influencers, so to speak, and they say, &quot;Oh, this is the best moisturizer ever.&quot; &quot;This is the best hair blow dryer ever,&quot; or that kind of thing, and they&#x27;re doing that because they&#x27;re getting paid to do that. And they get paid by the click sometimes and by the purchase, of course. And they all earn commission and stuff for selling all the stuff. And they&#x27;ll claim that, &quot;Oh, this is the best cream, and you have to use it.&quot;</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s no different than the infomercials of days of old. It&#x27;s now just all done on social media. So, then you buy the cream, and then it doesn&#x27;t work. Or you buy the widget, and it doesn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s the same thing with infomercials, and you bought those Ginsu knives once upon a time or the vacuum cleaner that doesn&#x27;t actually vacuum anything, or you know, whatever it was you happened to be up all night thinking about while you were watching those infomercials. And you couldn&#x27;t help it if you happened to fall asleep with the TV on because they&#x27;d be 10 times louder than any program you were watching before that.</div>

<div class="line">Used to scare me out of dead sleep sometimes. You know, you gotta buy those 1970s CDs or whatever it was; at least here in America we had those commercials. I don&#x27;t know if they were worldwide, but that was back in like the 90s. But anyway, you&#x27;ve got to be careful when you&#x27;re looking at things online. And even the Chatbot GPTs, and all the wonderful resources we have out there - they just take information from the Internet.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010740">01:07:40</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So the same people that are putting the information out there, some of them may be honest and some of them may not be. So you&#x27;ve got to take a look. I mean, for myself, there&#x27;s been a couple of instances that I&#x27;d just kind of point out.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010754">01:07:54</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So there&#x27;s a lot of science information online, too. And that science information will tell you that if you eat this or drink that or do this, you know, that you will lose weight or become taller or shorter or thinner or everything will work out. But is there the science behind it to prove it? And this is kind of where the ideas to do something and projects to do something differ. Most of the people, not all of the people, but I would say there&#x27;s a good percentage of the people out there that are just looking for information on something they might have a passion about. You know, and sometimes you have to fix your car. I know that I was fixing my daughter&#x27;s car one time, and I just couldn&#x27;t get - I was actually replacing an alternator, is what I was replacing.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010858">01:08:58</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And no matter how many times I turned it and twisted it, it was like a Jenga puzzle trying to get it out of there. And this was a Honda, and it must be made for people with really small hands - I mean really small hands, I guess - because I&#x27;m turning this thing and twisting it, I&#x27;m taking off belts, and I&#x27;m trying to get the thing out so I can put the new one in the same way I finally figure out how to get it out. So I go to YouTube University for a minute, and I&#x27;m looking up that make and model, and there&#x27;s one guy on there that says, &quot;Oh, you&#x27;ve got to take it out through the top.&quot; Just remove this, take this, and it&#x27;ll come right out. So I tried to take it out through the top after going to YouTube University, and it didn&#x27;t come out.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-010948">01:09:48</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I had to watch another guy. He says, &quot;Oh, you&#x27;ve got to take it past the frame, and you&#x27;ve got to pull it over here, and it&#x27;ll come out this way.&quot; Didn&#x27;t come out. So then I stopped listening to YouTube University, and I said, I don&#x27;t know how big these people&#x27;s hands are or what they&#x27;re using to get this out, but I guess I&#x27;m going to have to figure it out myself and pull it out. So eventually I did. I figured it out myself, and I got it out, and I got the other one in and fixed the car. So it&#x27;s a little bit of a long story, but the point here is that you&#x27;ve got to do things yourself. You really do.</div>

<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011034">01:10:34</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">What I mean by &#x27;do things yourself&#x27; is you have to take your own personal responsibility for your own self. If you see this new widget, or a new cream, or a new supplement, or something online - passing on that information as your own doesn&#x27;t really work out that well. I mean, it really doesn&#x27;t. And I know a lot of people that do that. There&#x27;s a lot of influencers and a lot of people online that&#x27;ll grab ahold of somebody&#x27;s information and just pass it on like it&#x27;s their own, and then before you know it, they&#x27;re making commission on selling insert-nutraceutical-name-here.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011118">01:11:18</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So what I do challenge you to do, as far as your own personal self, is do your research. It&#x27;s part of the reason why we put the certificate of analysis on all our oils, because I expect you to look at it. I don&#x27;t expect you to take my word for it; I expect you to look at it. And I expect you to see the ones that are in bold - because it breaks down all the terpenes and the plants - and research what is in bold that is on that certificate of analysis. Because if you research those things, and we say, &quot;Mix this with this,&quot; or you take a look at some of the blends that we did and we say, &quot;Mix this with this,&quot; then you&#x27;ll actually find tons of medical studies online that will tell you that &#x27;this does this, and this is why you want to use it.&#x27;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011214">01:12:14</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">You know, and this is for your own personal self. So it&#x27;s the difference between an idea and a project - and we&#x27;ll get to that in just a second. The other thing you want to look at when you&#x27;re looking at these medical studies is you want to make sure that they are what&#x27;s called an &#x27;in vivo&#x27; study. An in vivo study means they took actual living people, plants, or whatever it is you&#x27;re going to use the thing for, for its many uses, and they say, &quot;Okay, we had a group of people, and these people took a placebo, and those people took this particular terpene.&quot; Sometimes it&#x27;s in the form of a powder or whatever, or they use this particular oil. And this is the end result.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011305">01:13:05</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So that means it&#x27;s not a speculation; it&#x27;s not an idea. They took an idea - based on knowledge - and gave it a go. I mean, they actually put it into something practical. They got a group of people together that everybody had whatever it is, X, anxiety as an example. And they said, &quot;Okay, we&#x27;ve taken a whole bunch of people that have had anxiety, and we used aromatherapy, and these people inhaled it, and these people took a drop and swallowed it, and this is the end result.&quot; And they&#x27;ll say, &quot;Well, the people that swallowed it had this result.&quot; The people that used it as aromatherapy slept better or whatever it is. And it&#x27;ll give you all the information with any plant that contains that terpene.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011402">01:14:02</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">It&#x27;s the same way that things are starting to work because of the marijuana industry and CBD and other things that are coming out. But there are plenty of plants that contain the same thing that CBD has. So anyway, lots of research. Now, other medical studies will be what you call an &#x27;in vitro&#x27; study. An in vitro study tells you that they are in a laboratory and they might have some tissues and this and that, and they&#x27;re checking to see the effects in a laboratory.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011440">01:14:40</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But having a bacteria issue or a viral issue or something like that in a human or in an animal is not the same as having it in a petri dish. That is a controlled environment. It doesn&#x27;t have other factors that may be going on in other people&#x27;s bodies. You know, and there&#x27;s a whole different ball of wax between an in vivo study and an in vitro study. And I point this out to you because ideas are like in vitro studies.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011512">01:15:12</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, you might have kind of gone on YouTube University, or you&#x27;ve done your research into things, and it sounds really good; it sounds like it&#x27;ll work. Maybe you bought some of the ingredients or parts to make your widget, and in theory, it&#x27;s putting out X, you know, in a controlled environment, and maybe it&#x27;s actually going to generate this electricity, or whatever it is you&#x27;re doing. Or it&#x27;s going to be a cure for this or a help for that. And then you get funding from an organization like C.A.R.E., or you&#x27;re challenged by a group of scientists that are working in a research and development center to put those ideas or those in vitro studies into an in vivo study. And in vivo I don&#x27;t necessarily mean everything goes into a living person, and that&#x27;s what science tells us, but what I mean is you&#x27;re going to put that into action. You&#x27;re going to take that electric generator, or that med bed, or whatever, and you&#x27;re going to work on a whole bunch of people with that med bed and see if it works.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011636">01:16:36</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">That&#x27;s the difference between having an idea and having it in a project. You&#x27;ve got ideas. You might have it on paper. You might have created the most amazing formulations. But in practice, do they actually work? Can you combine those ingredients together without causing all kinds of other health issues for the person? You don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s in a petri dish, but you&#x27;ll know if it&#x27;s actually a group of people standing in front of you.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011707">01:17:07</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So just a little bit of a tidbit of things to think about as we move into C.A.R.E. You know, a lot of people have a lot of ideas, and we have a lot of ideas too, meaning myself and other people. And when we are working on those ideas, before we start putting the ideas into motion, meaning I put money behind it or I put time behind it. I have thoroughly done my research; I have analyzed everything beyond analysis to give myself the best probability. But it&#x27;s not an actual project until I take all the things I researched on chatbots or wherever I go and YouTube University, and I not only put them on paper, but I put several different options. I factor in weather, and I do all those kinds of things, and I&#x27;m like, &quot;Wow, this looks really good,&quot; in this controlled environment here we call my paper or my computer.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011819">01:18:19</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But can I take this and make one? First of all, do all those parts go together? Or do all those ingredients go together? Or can I combine these nutraceuticals together to make something good? Will it work? Who knows? So now you&#x27;ve got to group together people, or you&#x27;ve got to take your widget into the harshest environments, a place where there&#x27;s minimal sun; you&#x27;ve got to test it in the winter and summer, and you&#x27;ve got to do all these different things in order to create something.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011858">01:18:58</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Once you&#x27;ve gotten to that point where you&#x27;ve done what I call an in vivo study, meaning you&#x27;ve taken your great ideas and now you&#x27;ve put them into practical things. Now you have a project on your hands. Now, in order to make more than one widget, maybe you had to save up money to make that one widget or to buy all those ingredients for whatever it is you&#x27;re making. Well, and you&#x27;ve tested it, and you say, &quot;Okay, well, hey, I think this could work.&quot; Are you going to rely on it?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011934">01:19:34</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Well, I mean, first of all, C.A.R.E. is probably going to say, &quot;Okay, well, let&#x27;s check it out in vitro first.&quot; Let&#x27;s put it together in a laboratory and see if it actually runs. Okay, well, it runs in this space. Now we&#x27;re going to take it, and we&#x27;re going to take it to Africa and see if I can get some water out of the air, or whatever it is we&#x27;re creating. It&#x27;s similar to the neutrino boxes.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-011957">01:19:57</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Everybody thinks that things are created in a day. It&#x27;s not the case. It takes time and it takes effort and it takes experimentation. And you can&#x27;t experiment if you live in a climate where it&#x27;s winter and you want to know how it reacts in the summer. To give you another example of that.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012017">01:20:17</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I&#x27;ve taken a lot of time and effort to put these oils out there in the way we did. You know, we put information, which has gotten us rejected by Google. So we would have to not put out all that information in order to get into like Google searches and that kind of thing. So, but that&#x27;s fine, you know, this is, if you&#x27;re listening and you&#x27;re watching, it&#x27;s for you. It&#x27;s, you know, I&#x27;m not trying to be the next large multi-level marketing company.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012051">01:20:51</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Let me put it that way to you, and to say it in a nice way. But I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that the world of oils can be kind of confusing, you know? And so I said, well, you know, I need to include some other ingredients in here too. That maybe, maybe I can&#x27;t get these ingredients in an oil form. And so, you know, I can definitely make a difference with, for example, eczema, psoriasis, varicose veins, cellulite, all kinds of things that a lot of people face.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012125">01:21:25</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">But there&#x27;s a lot of stuff out there that says it does something, but does it actually work? So one of my little, let&#x27;s just say this is fun for me, because you remember I always said I wanted to go work in a laboratory. So I kind of got this little makeshift laboratory going on down there in my basement, where I&#x27;ve been experimenting with a lot of ingredients, new things. I&#x27;ve been experimenting with making lotions and vehicles and serums and all kinds of things and different ways to use oils, as well as use water-soluble ingredients like different plants I can get vitamin C from that I can&#x27;t get in an oil form. There&#x27;s a lot of those out there.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012214">01:22:14</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So I&#x27;ve been having a lot of fun doing it, but I will tell you, taking ideas from the Internet and expecting them to work in practical terms, there&#x27;s a lot of people out there that say that they make this and they make that and they put these ingredients together. But I can tell you from personal experience that that is not the case [chuckle]. It doesn&#x27;t work. In practical terms, there are a million natural preservatives, so to speak, out there. And I&#x27;ve probably tried at least 20 or 30 of them.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012254">01:22:54</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">And I can tell you the ones that tell you, &quot;Oh, they&#x27;re broad spectrum; it&#x27;ll protect against mold and preserve the product in all-natural ways.&quot; It sounds lovely and amazing, but I can tell you that I&#x27;ve had many things after two, three weeks, and there&#x27;s definitely, you know, I&#x27;ve run them through a microbial test, and there&#x27;s mold in there. There&#x27;s bacteria growing in there; that&#x27;s not going to work. And so, you know, the world of natural things is definitely much different than trying to create something synthetically.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012335">01:23:35</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So it&#x27;s just a side thing I&#x27;ve been working on. I do hope to launch that line soon. We are pretty close to starting to put out the first products of that, after months and months and about six months. So I took an idea and a thought, because I can see all the wrongs out there and all the poison that they put in everything, and I turned it into a project. And eventually there&#x27;ll be many other people that will reap the benefit of my project. But again, in a laboratory, I say that&#x27;s like getting information off the Internet.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012413">01:24:13</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Oh, you can mix this emulsifier with magnesium and cholecalciferol and vitamin D3, and you can do all these amazing things, and yep, nope, you can&#x27;t mix oil and water together with this emulsifier and put that much salt in it. You&#x27;ve got to change that. So it&#x27;s been a whole work in progress. But anyway, again, anything I talk to all of you about is always a walk the walk thing. I know everybody would like to have certain things, like right now.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-012448">01:24:48</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">I would like to have things right now, too. But again, it becomes a solid project once you have practiced said project. And I know a lot of you are going to say, &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s going to take millions of dollars to make my project work,&quot; and all that kind of thing. You know, maybe in some cases it does. But you can start somewhere.</div>
