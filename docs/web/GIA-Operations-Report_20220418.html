    <h3>Summary</h2>

    <div class="summary">
        Kim explains that the old Multiverse control scaffold (Metatron&#x27;s Cube) is dissolving and is being replaced with a Source-aligned Tesseract structure. A strengthened Gegenschein alignment and periodic pulses from the Central Sun are re-establishing a direct Source connection while cutting off Lower-Astral access paths (e.g., Saturn-Moon Matrix portals). She says this is triggering backlash: tech interference (e.g., Summit at Oak Ridge), attempted Dark-side incursions, and heavy chemtrail activity intended to energize nanotech and ARCHON links. She reports that the Abraxas Empire fell on April 3 and ties black-market/finance structures (Jay&#x27;s Treaty, bond/derivative scaffolds on birth certificates, IRS coupon cycles, MERS re-leveraging) to a system now unwinding. Looking ahead to April 24 (and, in notes, April 26 for &#x27;balance/order/completion&#x27;), she anticipates increasing pulses every 3–4 days, human senses and cognition amplifying, and parallel liberation work on other planets.

<div class="line">Sunny: Hi everyone, and welcome to a special news report. I&#x27;m Sunny Gault with United Network News, and we have an update for you all. So let&#x27;s go ahead and bring our very own Kimberly Goguen on. And Kim, I know a lot&#x27;s been going on - a lot is always going on. But last time we chatted with everyone, we gave them the news that we&#x27;re now on the positive timeline that Source intended for us to be on. So let&#x27;s kind of pick things up and give them an update of what&#x27;s been going on in April.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000050">00:00:50</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: A lot has been going on in April. What hasn&#x27;t been going on in April? So everybody&#x27;s been talking about how their energy feels off - one day it&#x27;s great, the next day it&#x27;s terrible. Today&#x27;s a little bit different story, so I&#x27;ll just touch on that real quick.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: We had a major backlash from, I guess you would say, the Dark Side of the Multiverse. And they&#x27;ve been throwing the book at us today. So if you&#x27;re feeling a little bit off - a little dizzy, a little headaches - again, there was an issue at Oak Ridge Laboratories under Tennessee (it&#x27;s under Nashville) and they had fired up a computer system called Summit, which was connecting to a lot of graphics cards and GPS systems through your phone and through your computer.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000141">00:01:41</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: So if you&#x27;ve been on the computer a lot more than normal today, or your normal Monday computer activities, or you&#x27;re working, that is why you&#x27;re experiencing some issues. The matter should be resolved; just was resolved maybe about half an hour, an hour ago - and just in time for this broadcast - so you can get back on your computer now. No, I wanted to make sure you saw us! [Laughing.] So yeah, so that was today&#x27;s issues.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000208">00:02:08</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: We&#x27;ve also had a lot of shakeups in the Multiverse because of all of the changes. So I wanted to touch base, and just let you know kind of how this all worked - what the Matrix really, I guess you would say, almost was - because it&#x27;s almost gone now - and just give you a basic understanding of energetically where we&#x27;re at now, and what we can expect in the near future, and how this will affect you.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So, Sunny have you been feeling okay today?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000239">00:02:39</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Sunny: Today yes, but over the weekend. I felt very lethargic and I basically just took a break from the computer. Usually I&#x27;m still doing stuff, working and doing stuff on the computer, but I&#x27;ve learned to listen to my body. So today for me has been better, but over the weekend I was like, I couldn&#x27;t even look at a computer. So that&#x27;s what I was gonna ask you - could it have started earlier than today? Like when did this whole thing start with the computers and chips?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000305">00:03:05</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Yesterday wasn&#x27;t... it was lethargic, but today people are reporting like blurry vision, headaches, lots of stuff like that. So there was a lot of lethargy yesterday.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000321">00:03:21</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Sunny: And I had that; I had that, definitely.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000324">00:03:24</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: Yeah. Every day is a new adventure, so we never know what&#x27;s going to happen. Yesterday&#x27;s was more due to - and I&#x27;m going to go off the little bullet points I gave you, so I&#x27;m sorry - but yesterday was more due to a group called the ACIO, which is either Alien Contact Intelligence, they are... and then sometimes they say like Advanced Contact. They do not work for any agency. And they do not work for - uh-oh, I&#x27;m freezing now, is that better? Okay, there we go - so, they do not work for any agency, they work with agencies and militaries, or used to. And they are very, very advanced.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000416">00:04:16</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: So they started to detect the Metatron&#x27;s Cube structure (that I&#x27;ll explain to you here in a minute) - that was around Earth and throughout the Multiverse - was starting to fade. And they became concerned. So they started to fire up a - I&#x27;m not gonna get into the physics aspect of it - but, a machine, in order to protect that cube. So we reached out to them, we told them that it&#x27;s not necessary for that to be there anymore. It has been replaced; do your research. You don&#x27;t need to work with the militaries, you don&#x27;t need to work with the agencies anymore. And they went ahead and checked the archives, Hall of Records, the information, the Tesseract to make sure everything was secure - we weren&#x27;t going to all evaporate - and everything was good.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000505">00:05:05</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: So that was yesterday&#x27;s adventure, earlier in the morning. Like I said, it&#x27;s been a crazy time. So it took probably, I don&#x27;t know, 3 or 4 hours of clearing what they had put out. So most people are saying, you know, you still were tired throughout the night, till you went to bed. But most of it was cleared up probably earlier in the morning; just took a little bit of time.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So yeah so that was yesterday&#x27;s. Any other days you want to talk about? What do you think people need to know about?</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000539">00:05:39</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Sunny: So, I mean, are those good guys, quote, unquote, or bad guys? I mean, you said that they were kind of protecting what was going on here - they weren&#x27;t up to speed. I don&#x27;t know where to rank them though.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000549">00:05:49</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: They are human in part, they are more transhuman. They were neutral, I would say. They were here to protect the agreements that were in place. And they had been unaware that a lot of those agreements had changed, and they were still going through the motions. I do believe that some of the information they&#x27;re getting from us (what we&#x27;re doing every day) is getting back to some of the generals and whatnot - and they had not realized it either, until yesterday in the afternoon, that Metatron&#x27;s Cube was just about gone.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-000630">00:06:30</div>
<br>

<div class="line">Kim: So it&#x27;s caused even more of a disruption today - this is the backlash that I was talking about. This isn&#x27;t really coming from the Deep State, this is just a matter of how things work. So, when a species is under threat and is dying, what happens is they&#x27;re gonna run, right? They&#x27;re gonna run to the nearest safe place. And a lot of them ran here today - and I think we&#x27;re pretty well cleared from that now, but it was pretty rough a little bit ago.</div>

But, we&#x27;re on it - we&#x27;re watching everything. So we&#x27;re gonna be okay. We&#x27;re gonna make it to the 24th. The timeline is secure, nothing has changed there.

<div class="line">Kim: The creatures that managed to - or beings, I should say - that managed to escape from the Dark Side of the Multiverse (or what you would call Hell), over to the Light Side of Multiverse. So that&#x27;s why like one minute you&#x27;re like &quot;Yay I have all the energy in the world!&quot; And then, 10 minutes later, you&#x27;re like &quot;Oh, where did that go?!&quot; And then headaches, blurry vision, different things.</div>

Like, earlier this morning you wake up and you&#x27;re like yay, you know, I&#x27;m doing great - and you might even feel a little bit tingly and light, and that&#x27;s because today was our second pulse from the Central Sun. Not our Sun, but the Central Sun, which is what you would call, like, Source-direct, right? We got a God-direct pulse - because it takes about, it happens about every three and a half to four days. So this was our second one, and this one was a lot stronger. And I&#x27;ll explain to you why it was stronger this time than it was.</div>

<div class="line">Kim: Okay, so if this is Earth [center of whiteboard], and then you would have our Sun [far right] - this is obviously not to scale. I&#x27;m running out of room here. And then you would have the Central Sun [upper right]. This is very large actually, and this is like pure Source Energy. This is what you would be calling a Nine Energy; a complete energy source. There&#x27;s nothing there except for all that condensed Light - it&#x27;s like almost a solid object at that point when you get there. And we&#x27;ll go over how that kind of works.</div>

<div class="line">Oh, it [the eraser] works! First time - the first time - it worked! [appreciative smile] Okay, so I&#x27;m going to redraw this real quick - Central Sun and Earth. So what&#x27;s happening now - and our Gegenschein is back - is these [Earth &lt;- nebulus -&gt; Central Sun] are almost in direct alignment, but not quite yet.

And on the 24th this alignment is perfect, so we&#x27;ll be getting 100 percent, like, a big slam of Source into the planet - which is going to be fantastic for some, and for some not so much so. So this is why we said, we may see a lot of the Deep State people - the deep, deep, Deep State, let&#x27;s put it that way; the ones that are probably not human anymore and possessed by something or other - go away. So when you say, &quot;Earth might go through a cleansing,&quot; yeah - it might go through a cleansing. But this is how it happened. So laying all that out there for you.</div>

<div class="line">So let me kind of show you what that is. And this is a multi-dimensional, multi-density &quot;energy binder,&quot; let&#x27;s call it. All right. So, the energy from the Sun is also Source energy - although in the past it was synthetically put there - they had put power packs in the Sun, and you had to buy the loosh to make your sun work, right?

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: So I&#x27;m going to draw this as linear, although we know things in the Multiverse are not linear. But just to give you a general idea. So you are here, okay, Earth. Earth exists in the Third Density. So we&#x27;re very dense, we&#x27;re solid creatures. And then you would go up to the Fourth. And then there would also be an equal and opposite Fourth down here. And then you would have a Fifth, you&#x27;d have Sixth, and Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth.</div>

<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: I went off my line. Okay. So Ninth, going this direction [up], would be pure dense Source. Like, only the Light can exist. So you couldn&#x27;t go there in your physical person and still have a physical person - because you&#x27;d have no density. So the further you get away from here [Third Density], the beings are less and less dense.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div class="timestamp" id="t-001514">00:15:14</div>
<br>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: So for example, like in the Eight Density, that&#x27;s where the Arcturians live and they&#x27;re pure Blue Light. I mean, they are healers of the Multiverse. And they can travel to other densities, but it&#x27;s usually aided with technology, and they really hate our frequency but they&#x27;ll come if they need to kind of thing [chuckle].</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Now, when you go down [below Earth], you have the same thing all the way till you get to Level 9 down here. Now, Nine down here (obviously I can count this is incorrect and I get that)...</div>

<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So you don&#x27;t start getting into creatures on this [lower] side of the Multiverse until... I mean, you do have some Eighth Dimensional beings, such as like the Tarzakians, the Targetians and whatnot that exist there. But they&#x27;re like... where the Arcturians are pure Light, the Targetians or Tarzakians (could have called both), are pure smoke. They look like smoky beings, like shadows. And they have red eyes, and you often see them kind of floating around if they&#x27;re around you (like certain people I&#x27;ve seen recently, let&#x27;s just say that). But yeah, you can see them, but they&#x27;re not dense in any way. So we&#x27;re talking densities here, right?</div>

<div class="timestamp" id="t-001652">00:16:52</div>

<div class="line">Kim: Sure. Yep, they&#x27;ll do a swap. So your soul goes here [down]. You know, usually somewhere in this region [between Lower Fourth and Eighth] and then they get to go up, like to Earth. And that&#x27;s how it works. And so, when I said that they (the deepest of the Deep State) were injecting themselves with something to make them good little hosts, that&#x27;s what I meant.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">So now they&#x27;re good little hosts for these beings that are not going to come. That&#x27;s okay. So that&#x27;s why I think it&#x27;s going to backfire. That&#x27;s my personal opinion. Whether it&#x27;s on the news or not, who knows? We&#x27;ll see. Okay, so this [diagram - see image below] is how density works in the Multiverse.</div>

So in order to have a harmonious - well not all the time because the Deep State does very good down here [Lower Astral], I can tell you that right now - and up here [Upper Astral], but you just don&#x27;t know where you are and why it happened and what&#x27;s happened.</div>

Then you would be in alignment with the people at the Sixth Density - three plus six is nine. Okay. And this is what had to be recreated, and is being recreated right now, for us.</div>

We need proper water. It&#x27;s not something that is stagnant. You have living DNA too that changes with everything you eat, drink, take, it changes every single second every place you&#x27;ve ever stepped in your life changes your living DNA.

They&#x27;re much more advanced than the rest of us, you know - they can travel up and down and wherever they want to go.

Because where they were trying to pull us - the very same people they&#x27;re talking to are trying to pull us down here [Lower Astral, Fifth Density]. So then, that becomes the dividing line, right?

Because a three and a five don&#x27;t make any sense. A five - that&#x27;s not a harmonious Multiverse. So a three and a five don&#x27;t make sense... a five and a one makes a six, you know...

And so here [draws line across cube] you would have had that line of demarcation, with us right here [small circle, center of line]. And now you can understand at least a little bit - and I don&#x27;t want to go into too much detail. So when they say the Dark timeline, you can see the structure here would have allowed, this was Fifth Density [top center] - anchored by the Abraxas, thank you very much. Fourth [line from 10 to 2 o&#x27;clock] and Fourth Lower [8 to 4 o&#x27;clock] and Seventh [6 o&#x27;clock].</div>

When we talk about our moon and we talk about our Sun and we talk about Saturn - and I&#x27;m just drawing it in a random position - the Saturn-Moon Matrix has to do with another triangle that would connect these dimensions at specific times, right? So when people talk dimensions, densities, you&#x27;re really have to figure out what they&#x27;re talking about.</div>

So in the grand scheme of our life, our human existence, the Cabal works with these folks here [Seventh Density Lower]. So when we talked about like the joint QS system [JAIQS], the quantum system joint agreement where one was Light up here [above top of visible whiteboard] in a Nine, and one was down here [below Seventh Density Lower] and that would have been all black, and then they extended throughout same way [redraws 12-8 and 12-4 o&#x27;clock connections] - you kind of get a better understanding of where you&#x27;re connecting to on the system-wise.</div>

Now this had to go - in order for this side [Light side] of the Multiverse to make it - that had to go.</div>
<div class="blank">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Kim: So we had to develop a different way to create densities. See, if you have ultimate darkness and ultimate light on opposite ends, you know, just like when you have a flashlight, ultimate light is when you&#x27;re looking at the light bulb in your eye, right? But if you shine the flashlight out, the light becomes less and less dense the further it gets from your person. So that before didn&#x27;t exist. There was only Source. That was it.</div>

To create other life except for Source itself. This is your big bang theory I guess you would kind of say. Did it happen as purported by scientists?

So like, for example, where the Abraxas were - they agreed, they made this agreement with those on the Other Side for power and what you would call wealth, I guess - not money but wealth - then that [Dark] side of the Multiverse takes over the other [Light] side. See? So if the Abraxas were originally - and they were a Fifth Density civilization - they actually created a direct portal between them and 7th, right? Seven, Eight, Nine - pretty low. And now this almost looks like an energetic loop between the two.</div>

And just give people kind of a basis of what you&#x27;re doing when you&#x27;re communicating, how to do it. We used to be able to do this all the time. And some of us still do.

Well, there&#x27;s many, many dimensions, but I can tell you this much, there are dimensions that will always add up to a nine. So there is the 18th, right?

And then everything is a frequency, both positive and negative. And how to protect yourself when you do do this, and when you do go, and when you do start talking to people, and be careful because not everybody&#x27;s nice, you know. It doesn&#x27;t matter... if you think just because somebody was up there in the past, then that doesn&#x27;t mean that they aren&#x27;t from down here - based on that structure, right?

So we&#x27;re going to see how that goes - that was a direct recommendation - so we&#x27;ll see. And then this structure [Metatron&#x27;s cube, bottom] is going away, not only in the Multiverse, but it&#x27;s also going away here on Earth because we don&#x27;t really need it anymore.</div>

But we&#x27;re already here. And that&#x27;s why I can report it - because we&#x27;re already here; it&#x27;s already here.

We could start to change the plasma, clearing the plasma, clearing the energy. I mean, for the first time - the Full Moon was like, what, on Saturday? No negative effects, like at all. Usually, like, I feel like I wanna hide under my covers, right? That&#x27;s the energy that comes from there. Didn&#x27;t have that. And if it wasn&#x27;t for that little hiccup yesterday with that other group then we would have been okay. And we still, you know, that was taken care of yesterday. No big deal.

By &quot;One&quot; they meant let&#x27;s all join hands with the demons of the Multiverse, right? These are Dark Beings down here, and your Chimera are down here, all the things that you hear about that go bump in the night. When we talked about Isis, we talked about the Devil&#x27;s Wife, right?

If you are in the United States and you&#x27;re watching this, there was an old treaty from 1796 called Jay&#x27;s Treaty. And it covered amity, commerce, navigation, who could use what ports - with the British Empire at the time, right? But interestingly, it had a lot to do with the Order of the Black Sun being able to control black-market goods. So anything outside of this that was not in here - it was never revised - and anything outside of that is what gave them control of the black market. Like, the mafia organizations and we all know that certain agencies traffic humans and drugs and everything else into this country. So that actually was canceled and replaced.</div>

And then they go to the ANNA system and then money comes out to take care of your person, before you are 18 years old. And then once you&#x27;re 18, your taxes - this is where the IRS comes from - your taxes go to pay back that bond and the coupons on the bond, right? Once you&#x27;re self-sufficient.</div>

<div class="line">Kim: So now you&#x27;ve paid back your free public education that wasn&#x27;t exactly free, and all these other things, right? You paid with your soul, and your bond. But it also, underneath the new system - it&#x27;s starting now to dissipate. We don&#x27;t want to cause major financial disruption, so this has been happening over time. And probably will continue through the end of the month.</div>

<div class="line">Kim: There are a lot of people who would run black market things, like Soros, and a few others - everything was just disappearing. All the derivatives that were issued off your birth certificates - because you actually are the base root for the derivatives market that is way out of control. So leveraging contracts, leveraging, leveraging and re-leveraging - that&#x27;s why some people say, &quot;Well, when I look up my mortgage in the mortgage system called MERS, I can see that I have seven mortgages.&quot; Well that&#x27;s why. That&#x27;s what you&#x27;re seeing. Yeah exactly, the bank gets to have money seven times but we don&#x27;t get seven times right? Of course.</div>

It had to do with them trying to install these whatever you want to call them, nanobots into us, one way or another. Putting them in food and all kinds of other things, for the last couple of weeks, I guess you would say, for the last month or two. They will not get the charge that they are expecting to get - they did not get their charge on the 18th that they thought they were going to have, right? Or sorry, by the 18th.

Both at us and... so I mean, like I said, it had a little bit of an effect on us, and people - if you&#x27;ve been on your computer a long time, you&#x27;re having headaches and whatnot - but it wasn&#x27;t nearly what they had desired to happen, right?</div>

Maybe things... you&#x27;ll start to feel changes of us going back to our former human selves, right? And it&#x27;s going to be gradual, and it will be over time. And for some, it&#x27;ll be like, &quot;Wow!&quot; You know? And then others, it&#x27;ll be like, &quot;Well, I feel different, not sure why.&quot; And then it will just take a little bit more time.

And I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s actual snake venom... I think it&#x27;s something different, or at least in the earlier ones. In the earlier ones there was Luciferin. Which is funny.</div>

<div class="line">Kim: Right. So Luciferin is the same thing that makes dragonflies tails light up in the darkness. And it also can cause - it&#x27;s not healthy for humans - but it can also cause neurological disorders. So I know in the earlier ones that was in there. So maybe that didn&#x27;t cause enough problems and they went to the bigger snake, or, I&#x27;m not sure - I&#x27;m not sure what they were trying to prove there.</div>

<div class="line">Kim: But hopefully everyone will be okay. We do have things to reverse that out. And we&#x27;ve talked about those. I know Lisa&#x27;s gone into it a number of times to try to help those that have been with effects and side effects. So we&#x27;re working; we&#x27;re working on everything.

I think I saw somewhere in your notes it was that the Earth Council was really excited about stuff that was happening now. Can you give us an idea of what the mood is? I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the right word but like - (Kim: What the vibe is?) - yeah. I mean, this is big, right? And we&#x27;re just so close to it.

The old ruling councils and the Pleiades are coming back, they&#x27;re trying to reorganize - they&#x27;re also in transition. We talked before about we&#x27;re not the only planet in transition. So all of these planets [5th Density and higher], well except for these [7th Density] - maybe someone will get moved there later. But these are different star systems - not just planets - they&#x27;re star systems. So all of these people that have been affected by this. Or, if you were located in the line of sight, so to speak [references 10, 2, and 6 o&#x27;clock positions of Metatron&#x27;s Cube], you would have been affected by this too.
