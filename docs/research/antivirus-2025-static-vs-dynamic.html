    <h1>Antivirus Reality Check (2025 Results, Static vs Dynamic IP)</h1>
    <p class="lead">Practical takeaways for real-world use, including a low-intrusiveness shortlist.</p>
  </header>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Executive summary</h2>
    <p>
      There is no single "best antivirus" for everyone. What works best depends on exposure, especially whether you are on a
      static IP or a dynamic IP. Static IP systems get discovered and re-targeted, so reputation and repeat-offender blocking
      can matter more. Dynamic IP systems see less persistent inbound targeting, so the focus shifts to phishing, malicious
      downloads, and exploit chains.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Static IP environments</h2>
    <p>
      If you have a static IP (self-hosting, exposed services, or any system that can be reached repeatedly), you will often
      see persistent inbound scanning and probing once the IP is found. In this environment, the combination of Windows Defender
      plus Malwarebytes Premium has been extremely effective in practice, because Malwarebytes adds a reputation and behavior
      layer that can reduce repeated inbound junk traffic dramatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bottom line for static IP: Windows Defender + Malwarebytes Premium is an excellent layered setup.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Dynamic IP environments</h2>
    <p>
      Most consumer connections use dynamic IPs, so inbound persistence is typically lower. In this environment, the dominant
      risk is usually user-driven execution paths such as phishing, browser downloads, attachments, and scripts. Many magazine
      rankings and "best of" lists favor commercially sold products, which can skew perception of built-in tools. Windows Defender
      is often treated as a baseline in editorial lists even when it performs competitively in independent lab testing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even so, running Windows Defender + Malwarebytes Premium on a dynamic IP can be "overkill" but still valid if you value
      layered defense and do not mind extra components.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Why editorial rankings can look odd</h2>
    <p>
      Independent labs typically score outcomes such as protection, false positives, and performance. Editorial lists often score
      products as retail packages, including bundles and extra features (VPN, password manager, identity tools) and overall value
      as a paid product. This can cause free built-in tools to be described as "baseline" even when their protection results are
      strong.
    </p>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Top-tier, low-intrusiveness shortlist (2025 results)</h2>
    <p>
      This shortlist focuses on products that performed strongly in 2025 lab results and are commonly regarded as low-noise and
      non-intrusive in day-to-day use. User experience matters because overly aggressive popups, upsells, and bundled add-ons can
      train people to ignore security warnings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recommended top-tier, low-intrusion choices:
    </p>
    <p>
      1) Microsoft Defender (Windows Defender)<br>
      2) Bitdefender<br>
      3) ESET<br>
      4) Kaspersky<br>
      5) Malwarebytes Premium (excellent as an additional layer)
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Excluded due to frequent intrusiveness complaints</h2>
    <p>
      Some products can perform well in tests but are frequently criticized for intrusive behavior such as persistent popups,
      upsells, bundled extras, or heavy footprint. If you have had poor experiences with these, you are not alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commonly excluded for intrusiveness complaints (despite technical capability):
    </p>
    <p>
      - Avast / AVG<br>
      - McAfee<br>
      - Avira (especially free tiers)
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Takeaways</h2>
    <p>
      1) Static IP: reputation and repeat-offender blocking matters more. Defender + Malwarebytes can be a strong pairing.<br>
      2) Dynamic IP: top-tier engines do very well; Defender is often underrated in editorial lists because it is free.<br>
      3) Intrusiveness matters. Quiet software can be safer in practice because it keeps users from tuning out alerts.
