    <h1>Antivirus Reality Check (2025 Results, Real-World Use)</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      How static vs dynamic IP environments change what "best antivirus" actually means.
    </p>
  </header>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>For most people on dynamic IP connections (roughly 98% of users):</strong><br>
      A single top-tier antivirus engine is sufficient. Based on 2025 lab results, Windows Defender is now a legitimate top-tier choice and should not be ruled out simply because it is free. Other strong options exist, but Defender belongs in the same class.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>For systems on static IPs or with exposed services:</strong><br>
      The threat model changes. Persistent inbound scanning and repeat targeting dominate. In that environment, Windows Defender combined with Malwarebytes Premium provides significantly stronger real-world protection than a single engine alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Key takeaway:</strong><br>
      Antivirus rankings often undervalue Defender due to editorial and commercial bias, not technical weakness. The best solution depends on exposure, not brand or price.
    </p>      
    <p>
      <strong>Static IP users (exposed systems):</strong><br>
      The threat model changes completely. Persistent inbound scanning and repeat targeting matter far more.
      In that environment, Windows Defender combined with Malwarebytes Premium has proven to be exceptionally effective.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Key point:</strong> Many rankings undervalue Defender because it is free, not because it is weak.

    <h2>Scope and Ground Rules (2025 Results Only)</h2>
    <p>
      Everything on this page is based on how products performed in 2025, used to make practical choices for 2026.
    </p>
    <p>
      This deliberately ignores historical reputation, "used to be good" narratives, marketing claims,
      and affiliate-driven rankings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal is not to crown a brand, but to match real-world exposure with current capability,
      using recent independent lab outcomes and actual user experience.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Dynamic IP Environments (Most People)</h2>
    <p>
      Most home and mobile users operate on dynamic IP addresses, where the external IP changes regularly.
      In this environment:
    </p>
    <p>
      - Systems are not persistently re-targeted at the network level<br>
      - Inbound scanning pressure is lower<br>
      - The dominant risks are:
    </p>
    <p>
      phishing<br>
      malicious downloads<br>
      exploit chains<br>
      script-based attacks
    </p>
    <p>
      This is why commercial antivirus rankings often emphasize execution-layer protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      A single strong engine that scores well in real-world protection tests generally provides excellent coverage here.
      Windows Defender is often described as "baseline" in editorial rankings, but that framing is misleading.
    </p>
    <p>
      Based on 2025 lab results, Defender is now a legitimate top-tier engine.
      If it were sold as a paid product, it would almost certainly rank higher in magazine lists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Running Defender plus Malwarebytes Premium in a dynamic IP environment can be considered overkill,
      but it is still valid if you prefer layered defense and do not mind the extra components.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Static IP Environments (Why They Are Different)</h2>
    <p>
      Static IP systems behave very differently from a threat perspective.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once a static IP is discovered:
    </p>
    <p>
      - it gets scanned again<br>
      - it gets probed again<br>
      - the same sources come back repeatedly
    </p>
    <p>
      The dominant problem here is not just malware execution, but persistent inbound noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this environment, reputation-based blocking and repeat-offender tracking provide outsized benefits.
    </p>
    <p>
      In direct real-world use, the combination of Windows Defender and Malwarebytes Premium has proven
      exceptionally effective at reducing repeated inbound junk traffic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Malwarebytes adds a layer that focuses on behavior and reputation over time, which matters far more
      once attackers can reliably find you again.
    </p>
    <p>
      For static IP users, this combination consistently stands out as the strongest practical setup.
    </p>

    <h2>Recommended Short List (2025 Results, Low Intrusiveness)</h2>
    <p>
      Security is not just about detection percentages.
    </p>
    <p>
      User experience matters. Products that constantly nag, upsell, inject add-ons,
      or hijack attention train users to ignore alerts, which reduces real-world security.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following products combine strong 2025 lab performance with consistently low intrusiveness.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Microsoft Defender</strong><br>
      Silent by default, deeply integrated, no upsells. Now technically competitive with the best engines available.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Bitdefender</strong><br>
      Excellent protection with restrained behavior when properly configured.
      Strong results and a professional user experience.
    </p>

    <p><strong>ESET</strong><br>
      One of the quietest commercial antivirus products.
      Highly regarded for low overhead and minimal interruption.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Kaspersky</strong><br>
      Technically excellent engine with low false positives and generally non-intrusive operation.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Malwarebytes Premium</strong><br>
      Especially valuable as an additional layer.
      Clear alerts, strong behavior-based blocking, and low noise.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Commonly excluded due to intrusiveness (despite capability):</strong></p>

    <p>
      Avast / AVG (aggressive pop-ups and marketing)<br>
      McAfee (heavy footprint and renewal pressure)<br>
      Avira, especially free tiers (persistent upsells and bundled extras)
