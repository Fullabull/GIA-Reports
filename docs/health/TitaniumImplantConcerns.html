    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Titanium, originally known as the "space-age metal," now plays a vital role in dentistry. With the development of new processing technologies such as lost-wax casting, computer-aided machining, and electrical discharge machining, titanium and its alloys are increasingly used in biomedical devices. They are currently used in the manufacture of prosthetic joints, surgical splints, brackets and fasteners, dental implants, crowns, and partial denture frameworks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dental implants are typically made of pure titanium or titanium alloys, which offer excellent biocompatibility and osseointegration. However, in the oral environment, due to temperature and pH fluctuations, implants can corrode, leading to allergic reactions. Furthermore, some patients report worsening health after receiving titanium implants, and these reactions may also occur elsewhere in the body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although some believe that titanium allergies are impossible, increasing evidence suggests that titanium can indeed trigger allergic reactions. All metals in contact with the biological environment corrode, leading to the formation of metal ions that trigger the immune system. Therefore, titanium allergy may contribute to the recurring and unexplained implant failures in some patients. Patients with allergies to other metals have also been reported to be at increased risk for titanium allergy.
    </p>

  <section id="types-of-allergies">
    <h2>Types of Allergies</h2>
    <p>
      Allergic reactions are hypersensitivity reactions of the immune system to specific antigens and can be divided into four types: type I, type II, type III, and type IV.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Type I (immediate):</strong> IgE-mediated interaction with mast cells, releasing substances such as histamine, leading to acute symptoms such as hives.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Type II (cytotoxic):</strong> Mediated by IgG or IgM, causing cell damage, as in autoimmune hemolytic anemia.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Type III (immune complex):</strong> Triggered by deposition of antigen-antibody complexes in tissues, as in systemic lupus erythematosus.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Type IV (delayed):</strong> Primarily T-cell mediated; occurs some time after exposure to the allergen, as in contact dermatitis.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Metal implants such as titanium and zirconium may trigger type IV allergic reactions, affecting their biocompatibility and implant success. Patients may experience symptoms such as memory loss and irritability, often accompanied by migraines and muscle pain.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="oral-manifestations">
    <h2>Oral Manifestations of Allergy</h2>
    <p>
      Patients with oral allergies may experience a variety of symptoms, including burning, stinging, swelling, dry mouth, and loss of taste. They may also experience headaches, indigestion, weakness, arthralgias, and myalgias.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manifestations of oral allergy include oral mucosal erythema, lip edema, palatal purpuric patches, oral ulcers, hypertrophic gingivitis, glossoptosis, angular cheilitis, perioral eczema, or lichenoid reactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Type I allergies may present with acute swelling in the oral and facial areas, potentially involving the upper respiratory tract and posing a risk to the patient. Severe cases may develop into urticaria, with or without stinging, confined to a small area of the mouth or pharynx.
    </p>
    <p>
      Type III allergies may manifest as oral ulcers or, in more severe cases, erythema multiforme and large oral ulcers, accompanied by typical skin lesions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Type IV allergies may present with eczema, angular cheilitis, oral mucosal erythema, hypertrophic gingivitis, and perioral dermatitis. Clinical lesions are typically confined to structures containing the allergen, such as lichenoid reactions in front of mercury-containing amalgam fillings or the palatal mucosa next to prostheses containing methacrylate resins. The most common manifestation is a lichenoid reaction characterized by oral lichen planus-like lesions. Lesions may be reticular, atrophic, erosive, or macular and are often associated with implants.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      Leptinoid reactions have been reported in association with dental amalgam and gold. [The following appears unrelated and may be a separate topic:] Lingual erythema, angular myelitis, leukodermal reactions, contact myelitis.

    <h2>Titanium: A New Allergen</h2>
    <p>
      Titanium is a metal used in medicine and dentistry for its strength, corrosion resistance, and excellent biocompatibility with the formation of an oxide layer on its surface. In oral and maxillofacial surgery, titanium alloys are used in osteosynthesis plates for traumatology or maxillofacial surgery, as well as in implants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Titanium has been used in cast dental prostheses since the 1970s. Equipment is available for casting titanium into single- and multi-unit crown and bridge frameworks, implant-supported structures, and partial and complete denture abutments. Titanium is also used in endosteal and subperiosteal implants. Endosteal implants are available in the form of rods, posts, and blades made of pure titanium or titanium alloys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Titanium is most commonly used in the form of "commercially pure" titanium (CPTi: grades I to I-IV alloys). CPTi contains trace elements (N, C, H, Fe, O, Al, V) up to 1 percent by volume, which improve its mechanical properties and fracture resistance. In implantology, titanium is also used in the form of alloys (grade V titanium): Ti-6Al-4V, Nitinol (Ti-Ni), Ti-Co, or titanium-zirconium, particularly when narrow implants are recommended.
    </p>
    <p>
      The symptoms most commonly associated with allergic reactions to titanium are those caused by chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). CFS is characterized by sudden and persistent fatigue, decreased mental capacity, and physical weakness. Because titanium is widely considered a biocompatible metal, allergic symptoms caused by skin contact are rare.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first case of suspected delayed sensitivity to titanium in CFS, accompanied by a localized granulomatous reaction, was described in a patient wearing a cardiac pacemaker. In these cases, the diagnosis of titanium allergy was confirmed by a positive patch test, a positive intradermal reaction to a small patch placed in the pacemaker, and a positive reaction to the pacemaker surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      A case report linking titanium allergy to dental implants has been published, including one patient who developed a type IV allergic reaction, including facial eczema, after receiving a titanium mandibular implant. This allergic reaction is diagnosed based on clinical symptoms (such as eczema developing within a few weeks of implantation) and a positive LTT blood test. After treatment and implant removal, the eczema symptoms resolved, further confirming the diagnosis of titanium allergy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A recent study showed that 37.5 percent of 56 patients who underwent titanium implant surgery tested positive for titanium on a MELISA. These patients experienced a variety of serious health problems, such as muscle and joint pain and chronic fatigue. Interestingly, despite negative patch tests, most patients experienced significant improvement in symptoms and normalized MELISA tests after implant removal.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another three-year prospective study of 1,500 patients undergoing dental implants, only 0.6 percent tested positive for titanium on a patch test.
    </p>
    <p>
      Studies have shown that the high corrosion rate of titanium, aluminum, and vanadium implants may increase the risk of allergy development. Existing research highlights the challenges of diagnosing titanium allergy. Commonly used skin tests are not very sensitive, and standardized patch testing methods are lacking. Due to these diagnostic difficulties, the true prevalence of titanium allergy in dental implant patients may be underestimated.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="testing-and-diagnosis">
    <h2>Testing and Diagnosis</h2>
    <p>
      Studies on the diagnosis of titanium allergy have shown that long-term exposure to titanium may lead to hypersensitivity reactions and immune dysfunction, indicating that titanium is not completely bioinert. In implantology, titanium allergy testing is essential for patients with a history of metal allergy.
    </p>
    <h3>Pre-implantation</h3>
    <p>
      Many patients may have multiple allergies, particularly those with allergies to metal or jewelry, who are at increased risk for metal implants. For these patients, pre-implantation metal allergy evaluation and testing is recommended to avoid implant failure due to allergic reactions.
    </p>
    <h3>Post-implantation</h3>
    <p>
      Implant failures are primarily caused by infection and overload. However, some failures are unexplained, such as sudden implant loss or multiple failures in the same patient (clustering) without signs of infection or overload. Allergy testing should be considered if allergic symptoms such as rash, urticaria, itching, orofacial swelling, erythema, cheek eczema, or mucosal hyperplasia occur.
    </p>
    <h3>Available Tests</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Skin testing (patch testing):</strong> Various allergens are applied to the patient back; reactions such as erythema and vesicles are assessed at 48 to 72 hours. This test is approximately 75 percent effective for type IV metal allergies, but is limited by sensitivity and standardization issues for certain metals. Titanium sulfate and titanium chloride are recommended reagents, but studies on implant allergies have not yet been conducted.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Type I allergy:</strong> Diagnosed using a skin prick test, which provides rapid results. Intraoral testing related to dental materials is not recommended. Type IV allergies are often associated with dental materials and can be diagnosed with blood tests.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) and MELISA:</strong> LTT measures lymphocyte proliferation after exposure to an allergen. MELISA is an optimized version of LTT for detecting metal allergies. It is recommended before procedures involving titanium, as implant removal can be difficult once implants are integrated into bone. MELISA is a non-invasive blood test that requires the blood sample to be sent to the laboratory within 24 to 48 hours of blood draw. Allergens are selected based on patient history and metal exposure history; memory lymphocytes are isolated and tested in the blood. These cells become activated and begin to divide when exposed to antigens such as metal ions. The lymphocyte response is measured using two techniques: uptake of a radioisotope by dividing lymphocytes and microscopic assessment. Reactivity is expressed as a stimulation index (SI), with SI greater than 3 generally indicating a positive reaction. Results are available within 10 to 14 days.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section id="corrosion-and-tantalum">
    <h2>Corrosion and Tantalum</h2>
    <p>
      Metal-induced reactions are highly specific. Corrosion and dental implant corrosion are deteriorations caused by the interaction of metals with their environment, involving the release of ions. However, passive metals such as tantalum effectively resist corrosion by forming a protective surface oxide layer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Studies have shown that corrosion is a factor in implant failure, but the use of materials such as tantalum can reduce this problem. Metal materials are generally at risk of corrosion in the in vivo environment, but tantalum corrosion resistance helps mitigate this risk. When metal particles or ions are released from the surface of tantalum implants, their migration and biodistribution within the body are controlled, reducing potential impact on surrounding tissues. In addition, tantalum corrosion resistance reduces particle release due to mechanical damage, such as during insertion or removal of implants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, the use of tantalum in implants not only improves biocompatibility but also enhances the long-term stability of the prosthesis, providing an effective way to address the corrosion problem of metal implants.
