        <strong>
        <br>George:  Good evening everyone, and welcome to the After Show. I'm your host, George Iceman, for The Reveal Report. This is Patreon, the Q&A with our guest, Ms. Kim Goguen. And we just did a great show on YouTube. We talked about a few things, but we left it on kind of a cliffhanger. And the cliffhanger was California and the forest fires and Governor Newsom. What happened? What are thoughts on what's going on? Prior to this, there was a huge plan for 2028, it was a 15-minute city - they had all kinds of plans. They already have investors and people to come in with money to buy this land. The Olympics is around the corner. And now I'm hearing there's a huge deal made with a train, and there's going to be a special train that can go across California to Las Vegas, just in time for the Olympics. A lot is going on - is it a coincidence? Is there something more to it? Kim, I'll let you take it away before we start taking some questions. Thank you.

        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:00:59</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, I know that the agencies here have been trying to build what they call 'smart cities' for a long time. I mean, that's a given. And it's similar to any other quote-unquote unnatural disaster, where they wipe out all the homes, they wipe out all the land - and then they come in and get it for free. The land has already been promised to multiple people, including BlackRock - that's no surprise there. And they have no intention of rebuilding those homes and having people move back in. It's a way to clear people out. That's number 1.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:01:35</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Number 2, they're a little shy on that budget for that plan of 2028. Yeah, a little shy. So, for some reason, the Trump operatives thought that if they could start these fires, that there would be all this government money or money from some fund somewhere that would come in to fund their plan. So immediately after the fire started, they started getting all kinds of - we started getting all kinds of inquiries into a disaster fund as far as funding for relief - but it wasn't going to go for relief, it was going for BlackRock's relief, because they're bankrupt.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:02:21</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  So yeah, the plan definitely was a land grab - no different during Hurricane Michael, where there were a lot of people that wanted to build casinos, I saw some of those plans on the little area there that was most affected which happened to be a poorer area of coastal land - and they wanted to build big resorts. So yeah, it would be the same in California.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:02:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Now, I was told through some investigators that 60 days prior to these fires, the insurance companies pulled their claims on properties, saying they would not be liable or responsible for natural disasters, fires, and so forth. That was 60 days prior - now this has happened. I don't know whether there's going to be a fund.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:03:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Is it possible, Kim, that... (Kim: I heard the same.) ...these, okay, you heard the same, that some of these people will come together in a RICO case for a court - now you know it's probably corrupt anyway - however, is it possible they're going to go to court, take the government to court, noose them somehow, to try to get some recoupage for these houses, for this land, for these businesses that lost?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:03:38</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Is there going to be a class-action lawsuit?  (George: Yes.) I doubt it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:03:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  I mean, I'm not a licensed detective, but I could see nefarious acts: I saw somebody lighting fires; I saw people throwing fires; I saw a helicopter dropping stuff with fire; I have proof and evidence, and that's me. I'm not a detective. So how can a bunch of millionaires who lost their homes not hire professionals to use this, and investigate this, and take them to court?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:04:13</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, you can answer your own question, can't you? If you're a millionaire and you live in the United States, you are... you're a card carrying member, aren't you? (George: Ahh.) They're all promised big payoffs and stuff behind the scenes. Keep quiet, shut your mouth. Here's some big payout that never ends up coming. It's supposed to be there next week and, you know, they'll play this game for a long time and nobody's going to say anything because when you're a part of that group, do you say anything, George? Do you go outside your little cult? Do you...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:04:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Well, you can't really do that. You can't go against the grain. You'll be shut out from everything. If you're a business owner, if you're an actor, if you're in music, you will be dissected. You'll be torn apart. And yeah, it's no good for you. So you can't really speak up.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:05:08</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  That's right. Can't really speak up, can't really say anything. You just wait for the money to come from these people and it never comes.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:05:17</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Lies and false propaganda. (Kim: Yeah.) Well, the wheel of foolishness and lies keeps rolling like a hamster on a wheel, I guess. And I wish those people the best. Some of them are innocent people.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:05:30</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  And Newsom's in on the deal.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:05:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Gruesome Newsom. Man, just one of the most dislikeable human beings I've ever laid my eyes on. I don't know, maybe he's a nice guy. I mean, he could be, but everything that comes across, just a slimeball.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:05:45</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  No, he's not.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:05:47</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  He's not a slimeball.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:05:48</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  No, that's not a good human.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:05:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  He's not a good human. Doesn't come across as - his aura and his energy is all wrong. It's definitely demonic, and you know, there's a price to pay for that and the Lord says vengeance will be his, not ours.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:06:04</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  You picked a great video. It's like, 'Hey, I'm on the phone with the president. I'm helping you right now. Oh, but I have no cell phone service.' So I guess they're talking telepathically.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:06:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  He's a psychic.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:06:15</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Yeah, he's a psychic now.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:06:17</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Yeah, he's got the spiritual gifts from his ancestors, which he doesn't, by the way, he's got no gifts from his ancestors. We live in a strange time, and unfortunately, all we can do is make the changes we can in our lives to better ourselves, do our own research and be quite aware of our surroundings so we could do what's best for ourselves, our friends and our family. On that note-
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:06:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  As always, George, too, the people that need help -  (George: Yeah.) - and it's the churches that come forward. It's the people that come forward to help other people. That's the way it's always been. And regardless of FEMA or anybody else, when there's a natural disaster and that type of thing in the in the U.S., or elsewhere, FEMA comes in and the cameras flash, and all that stuff - and then everybody leaves, you know?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:07:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  I mean, FEMA is so corrupt, it's corrupt as the day is long, it's a private enterprise - it's not even owned by the government; it's not federal in any way, shape, or form - and I don't want to get into any more conspiracies or stories I heard during wars with FEMA, because that'll go down a very bad slope, if you know what I'm talking about. They are not to be trusted in any way, shape, or form. I feel bad for some of these people.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:07:34</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Oh, and did you know where there is a natural disaster, all of the property and all of the area where there is a quote-unquote 'natural disaster,' if it's declared as such - as it was in this case - all that property becomes property of the government, and they can do with it what they want.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:07:54</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Haah! Now I'm going to tell you, you may not like this guy. You may not like this guy. But he's not a psychic per se, but he created a data dump system that could read verbiage from the dark web, the Internet, and so forth. And he claims that there's only so much that the government could push people until people fight back. And the time is coming where it's going to break, where people just can't take it anymore. Do you feel the same way that citizens are going to reach a point, a breaking point, where they just can't be picked on and suffer anymore, and they're going to crack?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:08:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  You know, the key to all of that is unity. Sorry, but it is. And one of two things is going to happen. Either - and they are wanting a civil war in the U.S., so be careful that you're not feeding the system itself. But as far as the people fighting back, you know, people are going to start listening to other people. They're going to start organizing themselves. That's what I hope to see happen.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:09:01</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  And then we just move on in a different way, doing something completely different. As far as you fighting back and fighting the government, it's a waste of your energy. It's just a waste of time. But I will tell you this - this is a fact - human behavior tells us that every 75 to 80 years, people do the same. And if they don't switch power sources and come up with a new savior for the people, then the government or whatever country that's been the world power center will burn. And this has been happening since the days of Caesar.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:09:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  So they have carefully calculated out a transition to a different government - a different world power center - on purpose. Now, they tried to maintain or correct that issue by all the propaganda they put out there about Trump and that Trump's gonna save us and Trump's gonna do this. So they tried to make the current world power the quote-unquote savior. That's what they tried to do.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:10:15</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  But we have too much social media now, where there's too many people recording things. There's people investigating, you know, this makes no sense. You know, people... at the same time, we have a lot more of that God/Source energy coming through. And it's helping people find their wisdom. Meaning the wisdom that you can only get from Source, from God, however you want to say that, it comes from the same place - wisdom doesn't exist in the darkness. So you're seeing a lot more people like yourself, George, go like, wait a minute, you know? No one said anything during Hurricane Michael. You know, the conspiracy theorists are no longer conspiracy theorists - they're TikTok heroes.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:11:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>We're seeing a lot of change in humans that - even if we switch to quote-unquote China or made a world power center switch to Russia or China or whatever the things they're talking about - it's not gonna change anything. The people are too awake and aware. You know, they could try to make it a police state. They could try to do... this is part of the fear porn that's going on with the immigration thing, George. It's all about creating enough fear in people, you know, that the government could do this to you, too. Okay, so right now it's immigrants. What's to say they're not gonna try to go door to door and take your guns?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:11:45</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  If you haven't seen it, it's a terrible movie. What I mean by that, the acting is terrible - it's a 'B' movie at best, maybe even a 'D' movie, but it's probably about a decade old now - it's called, 'Amerigeddon' is the name of the movie. Alex Jones is in it. And it's pretty poorly put together, but it will tell you what they're planning, and this is what the Trump operatives are planning if the people start to rebel.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:12:13</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Wow. So check that out, 'AmeriGeddon' [2016] with Alex Jones. It's a low budget movie but you said it kind of paints of a plan of what they're what they're gonna do if there's a rebellion. (Kim: Yeah.) Okay.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:12:25</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Exactly what they're planning on doing.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:12:28</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Well, we let Source - or I refer to God Almighty - to decide who wins and who doesn't win and when he's ready to pass judgment and make these people suffer. It's all in his timeline, whatever he wants to do, he's going to do. We can only bear witness to it. So I do hope -
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:12:45</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, and the one thing we know, as long as you stay in faith with what you're doing, you know, and you're honest in your intentions, you know, if something is taken away, something better always comes and takes its place. So if one door closes, another door opens. Maybe these people move to a different place; maybe their lives are better for it. And I'm not saying it's not a tragedy and it's not upsetting and people should be happy that this is happening in any way, shape, or form. But I'm telling you, he always provides. I've seen it in my own life and I'm sure some of you have seen it in years.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:13:18</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Yeah, God is good. So, all right, let's start taking some questions. I know a few people have questions for you. So if you do have a question for Kim, please raise your hand and try to keep it one question and we'll get it answered if we can. If you don't want to be seen on screen just turn off your video and we can hear your audio.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:13:38</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  But we will begin with Jonathan. Jonathan, welcome to the program and what's your question for Kim this evening?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:13:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Jonathan:  Can you hear me?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:13:46</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Yeah.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:13:46</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Jonathan:  Hi Kim.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:13:47</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Hi.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:13:48</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Jonathan:  It's good to meet you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:13:49</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Nice to meet you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:13:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Jonathan:  Briefly, I've followed you since your first video on the Internet, a very, very long time ago. When you opened that huge sheet of paper and showed the grand plan to everybody.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:14:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Me and my whiteboard.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:14:04</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Jonathan:  Yeah, well, it was a big, huge piece of paper you pulled out.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:14:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Oh, the big piece of paper - yeah, that was a long time ago.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:14:10</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Jonathan:  A long time ago. Yeah. So, I just have a question. They did Lahaina, and now they've done, you know, the wealthy district in California - one of my very close friends lost his home, him and his wife and their two kids, they survived, they got out - but one of the comments that he made was that the house, the fire started from the inside of the home, not outside. And I just wondered how much you know about directed energy weapons in use by this cartel, and if it is truly microwave tech or what it is, if you have any insights on that. I'd love to hear about that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:14:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, there are some areas that are kind of outside the fire where they are constantly shutting off the power right now. I have some friends in that area who are outside probably about 8 to 10 miles of the closest fire, but they are constantly shutting their power off, claiming there's high winds, there's this, there's that. And this is not something that's a regular occurrence like in this area. It's not happened last year. You know, maybe once in a while they'll do it because where they live it's an older, you know, a lot of older homes, that kind of thing, but it's not like it is right now.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:15:28</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  And it tells you that they're using some kind of electrical surges from within. This is a low budget operation and I hate to say that and I'm so sorry to hear about your friends, but that is one way that they are doing it. They're sending surges through the power system, which is creating fires. It's overloading the system. So, I think that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:15:52</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Jonathan:  That's interesting. Yeah, I was just wondering, because blue roof thing, anything blue doesn't burn. Homes are starting fire from the inside out. Steel is liquefying. These are things that don't happen in natural fires. The trees are left intact. It's clearly some form of advanced tech we don't know about or something. I just thought maybe you did.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:16:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, it's not really that far advanced. There are actually advertisements to buy direct energy weapon aircraft on the Lockheed website. I don't know if it's still there, but I know when we were looking into it during the Lahaina situation, you could go to their website and they'll tell you all about it. You know, it's mainstream information. Does the government own them and use them? Yes. Are they using them in this situation? Yes. But this is a little bit, again, this is Duck Dynasty, so it's a little... somewhat... put together in a different fashion where it's a multi-pronged approach in my opinion - that's what I'm seeing a lot of.

        <small><br><small>00:17:00</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Jonathan:  Thank you. It's an honor to speak to you after all these years.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:17:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, it's really nice to meet you too.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:17:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Jonathan:  It means a lot to me. I appreciate you taking the time to speak to me.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:17:09</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Thank you, John.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:17:10</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Thank you so much for coming on.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:17:12</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Mary, hi. Welcome to the show. And what's your question today?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:17:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Mary:  Hey. Okay. Nice. Hey, Kim. I do feel like you and I are destined to work together at some point - I'm here to help however I can. Just a comment. It is amazing - I do believe what you're saying about Trump - it's amazing that his family, that they're all acting as if he's still there, as if that's the person. But my question is about assemblages; the term that you said about how our bodies have assemblages, assemblages, and that how that's part of our... yeah, so if you could explain more about that. And then also, now that we don't have Dark, how do we create now? When there's not an Alpha and an Omega; when it's just the the GOLD Giver of Light Declaration. So how do we create now in this new paradigm? Thank you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:18:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  OK. When you first become a being - or at least a vessel here on this planet where your soul comes in - your cells start to divide. I mean it's part of science: that point at where those cells end up being in your body are what you call an Assemblage Point. Now, George, you're probably familiar with this a little bit, because it's also used for black magic. They focus on the movement of those Assemblage Points to target specific areas of the body to, let's just say, do bad things to us. At the same time, if you look it up on the Internet, it's gonna tell you your Assemblage Points are right here [hands at chest level]. And it's like a line that kind of goes across here. That's not always the case.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:19:04</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  And Assemblage Points can be moved. What they try to do is enter through this Assemblage Point because that is like a... almost like a zero point of your body. It's a point where energy converges, so to speak. And in the black magic side, they use this as an entry point to get your mitochondria moving in the wrong direction. This is what shortens your telomeres. This is what makes you age. This is how they can affect your energy field. They can make you feel ill, tired, and they can get in there and do their work. AIs did the same thing. Non-humans did the same thing. And this is how humanity looks and feels the way we do - about 99% of the reason.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:20:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  So clearing those Assemblage Points - which we need to have in our vessel, we do - but clearing those Assemblage Points will actually help us in a lot of ways. Without interference from AI systems, without interference from black magic folks, humanity will start to recover. The other thing we can do with Assemblage Points is we can use them as direct entry points for God or Source, whatever you call it. So coming in through your heart area is one way to think about it when you're trying to bring Source/God into your life, right?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:20:45</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  The other way to think about it too is your solar plexus, because that's the point where in your body where there's almost like a vortex. It creates this perfect - like what Tesla talks about - it's the zero point, the zero point energy. So bringing in all of that positive energy, you're almost pulling it into you. It's what you do naturally anyway. So they try to cut you off at that point so they can take it all.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:21:12</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  So that's what an Assemblage Point actually is. It's just another point of entry into your person, hopefully with just a direct line of Source, direct line of God. That is where you're - it's basically food for the soul, for the mind, body and the soul connection. It'll help you, once you understand that and you can focus all those points working in synchronicity, you reach out to God/Source however you do that, and you'll gain more wisdom.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:21:49</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  A lot of times people tell me that, "Well, when I'm in the shower..." or, you know - "I get a lot of insight into my day." Or, "Right before I get out of bed, I get some insight into my day." That's actually Source talking to you because your mind is clear, you're not so focused on the day to day, you're not worrying about things, you're focused, "Well, I'm just waking up," you know, and that's when you start to get those answers and the insights on how to solve your problems, how to get what it is you need for your family, whatever it is is your concern on that day - that's where it all comes in. I mean, I know it does for me. Sometimes it's in the shower, sometimes it's in the early morning hours. I mean, I've kind of got it to the point now where it's like 24/7, where I can just tap into that stream and figure out where I need to go and what I need to do. Because I mean, we're in uncharted territory now.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:22:49</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  I mean, even humanity as a whole is in uncharted territory. And so that navigation is 100% how I function on a daily basis in a lot of different ways. That insight that what's coming next, who's coming at me, what's gonna happen, all comes from that. And in my travels around the world, that was critical to my survival. I didn't have anybody I could call to bail me out. There was no agency. There's nobody. If anything, they were all against me. So getting out of buildings, getting out of countries, you know, having them cut off all my cards, my debit cards, credit cards, everything happened.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:23:34</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Take my passport, drive me into the middle of the woods, forest or whatever in China that's happened. Ending up in nowhere - Altai region, Russia. It's been a ride; it's been a roller coaster. But with Source as the navigator - where to find food, where to find something when you're out in the middle of nowhere - it's always been there for me. And that's one thing - no matter what anybody does to me, that they're ever gonna make me walk away from, and they have tried. So.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:24:09</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Thank you, Kim.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:24:10</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Mary:  Thank you, Kim.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:24:10</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Thank you, Mary.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:24:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Mary:  Thank you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:24:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  You're very welcome.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:24:13</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Great answer. Renee, How are you? Welcome to the program today. What is your question for Kim?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:24:19</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Renee:  Hi, good evening. Hi, Kim. I'm happy to be able to talk to you and listen to the broadcast. It's pretty interesting. I just have a question, in regards to Trump coming out in the news backing mRNA vaccine technologies, and the nanotechnology particles that people say are in these shots that they can control - is that push gonna keep continuing? Or is that technology unable to harm people now?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:24:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Right now, the administration, let's call them 'the administration' for ease. The administration is like a juggler with a thousand balls and they're trying so hard to please their donors, the corporates, these people, those people. "Just wait, all the money's coming." "All the payouts are coming." "All the payouts are coming." And people are asking like, "Why won't you work with the administration?" "Why won't you deal with these people?"
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:25:29</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, there's your answer. Because if I do, then that's what they're gonna do with the money. They're gonna appease all of these people, all the crypto people, all the dodgy coin. You know, they even made a whole department in the United States Treasury called 'DOGE' and guess who runs it? Elon Musk. It's D-O-G-E is the name of the department. You know, so are they going to continue with this process? I think they would love to. Are they going to be able to? I don't think so.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:26:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Renee:  Thank you so much. I was hoping you were going to say that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:26:06</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Thank you. Captain Ziggy, hi, welcome to the show.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:26:10</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Oh, one more thing: don't forget they put a gag order out - an executive order - they put a gag order out on the CDC and the FDA, right after they came up with the announcement for the endorsement.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:26:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Renee:  Interesting...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:26:25</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Because they were starting to say that, you know, it causes POTS, it causes all kinds of heart disease and all kinds of different things. Yep.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:26:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Captain Ziggy, what's your question this evening?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:26:38</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>CapnZiggy:  Well, what a fantastic apocalypse we're in now. I'm enjoying the heck out of it. You gotta enjoy it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:26:44</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  [laughing] What a ride, right?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:26:47</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>CapnZiggy:  I've been meditating this last week on whether I should go to Acapulco for the Anarchist Convention. And I looked at your backdrop and the Lord says, "There's your answer." So I'm making my reservations when I get done. But anyways, anyways, the question I got that drives me crazy - because I've been following you for many years - but you talk about the 'Trump operatives,' but you don't want to mention names. You talk about the guy with the boots. That's got to be that guy, Juan O'Savin, that I'm just, you know, it's got to be. You know, but again, because I hear this guy talking and stuff, and then you got Jaco, and the American Patriot Street Fighter, and all these guys. Are they what you consider 'Trump operatives?'
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:27:34</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  No. Juan O'Savin actually is. He is an SSP operative and he is part of that. He's not high enough to get into the really high meetings, but he is definitely a part of it, for sure.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:27:52</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>CapnZiggy:  You talk to your good friend, Kerry Cassidy, you know, that's JFK Jr. You know, she's kind of like out there on a limb.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:28:01</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, I think she'd like to do, what do you call that? How do I say this? I think she's had a fantasy for a long time about JFK Jr. She's kind of at that age when he was the man, you know, the bachelor to be had.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:28:19</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>CapnZiggy:  Every time I, because sometimes she does have good info you know she's talked to a lot of people. But then she starts going off on these tangents, where it's very narcissistic, I guess is a good way to put it. You know, she just - again because she never mentions you, and I know you two have done interviews together or whatnot. (Kim: Yeah.) You know? But, and that's, it just, and Ben Fulford, now what is he? Is he an operative?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:28:43</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Ben Fulford is a journalist.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:28:45</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>CapnZiggy:  Yes, he is.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:28:46</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  They are not quote-unquote 'Trump operatives.' A journalist is usually an agency person. As I understand it, his background is - his parents or father or whatever was an ambassador, which is also known as an agency person - and he's kind of been in that world for a long time.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:29:08</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Now, that is where all his contacts come from. Because he is in that world.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:29:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>CapnZiggy:  He talks the language.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:29:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Yeah, he kind of got the boot a little bit, and he went too far out - was giving too much information, probably a little over a decade ago - and now he's kind of kept in line by the Dragon Family, predominantly. Which is why he pushes that China agenda. That they're going to save us all.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:29:38</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>CapnZiggy:  Right. So then these guys like [Michael] Jaco and Scott McKay and all these guys, they just are disillusioned with who Trump is? Is that?... You know, because again, it just frustrates me when, you know, because again, I believe in what you say. And like Trump hasn't been around for a while and whatnot. But if you tell these Trump people, if you even mention that, they think you're smokin' some real good 420 [marijuana], and now you don't know what you're talking about. But it doesn't take a blind man - like you say, the shape of the head, the size of his body. I mean, just, again, why I don't belong here, and I can't wait to ascend to get to hell to the next level, because this is just crazy, this, Kim. And, again, God bless you for everything you do.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:30:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Thank you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:30:23</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Yeko, Yako, Jacko - I know I said his name wrong, and Kerry Cassidy just about hung me for it, but...
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:30:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>CapnZiggy:  CIA - former CIA.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:30:34</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Yeah, they reached out to him once - a few years back, to do an interview with me, like right in the beginning there, when I started coming out on YouTube and that kind of thing - and he didn't actually show up. He had his then business partner, Campbell, do the interview. He said that he was told not to do the interview. So that tells you he's got a handler. Are they paid to do this? Some of them are. (CapnZiggy: Right.) Paid to say what they say.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:31:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>CapnZiggy:  Some of them, they have a good heart. Some of them, you know, they've got some good stuff and they're good. But then I'm thinking, are these the Trump operatives that Kim's talking about?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:31:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  No, no, no, no, no, no. These are, these are people that are meant to put out propaganda and it's called, 'The Man On The Street,' you know.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:31:26</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>CapnZiggy:  Do you think they know they're putting out propaganda?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:31:29</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Some of them.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:31:30</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>CapnZiggy:  You know, that's the Smith-Mundt Act.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:31:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Some of them do.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:31:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Some of them do.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:31:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>CapnZiggy:  Right. Like I say, it's confusing. Goodness, Kim, when I'm not watching you, I'm just going to watch George or Judge Judy.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:31:40</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  [Hearty laughter]
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:31:40</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>CapnZiggy:  You know, and life is good. You can see how crazy this world is. Because again, there's so many NPCs out there and you can't get through to them. You can't, like I say, the people you need to talk to, they don't get in front of you, you know that? Just frustrates the hell out of me. But I'm on a mission where I'm going to help in that situation. We've worked together before, and we're going to work together again. Think about that one, Ms. Kim.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:32:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  God bless!
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:32:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, and it's all about the people, right? This is not really about governments or some guy on TV. It's about the people. And if we focus on what we're going to do to help the people, and if I was gonna educate the people - I'm not gonna try to convince them that their ideals about this president or that head of state or this actor is right or wrong. I'm gonna try to convince them that, 'Hey, you can live a little different,' you know, 'We can do this differently.' You know, if we all get together, let's all go to the grocery store and we'll split up all the stuff or whatever it is you decide to do that makes a difference in people's lives. Look, you know, hey, right now I don't see this guy paying my bills. So, you know, I don't see a NESARA/GESARA. I don't see all the stuff that they're promising everybody. So right now, what are we going to do? We got to survive.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:32:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>CapnZiggy:  We're going to spread love and light.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:33:00</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Thanks, Ziggy. Got to move on. I appreciate it. Rose, how are you? What's your question? (Kim: Thank you.) (CapnZiggy: Thank you, Kim.)
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:33:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Rose:  Hi, Rose from Toronto again. I'm great, George, how are you?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:33:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Very good, thank you so much.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:33:13</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Rose:  Great, question for Kim. These ACIO militaries, these space program military people, there's like 12 or 13 groups of them - you've done a nice long video on that a while ago - are these people, like, are they totally human? Are they hybrids? Are they chips? Like, you know, some of them have been around five or 6 thousand years. I mean, who are these characters?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:33:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  The groups. (Rose: Yeah.) To answer your question, some of them are. Most all of them are raised in the program, meaning they start from the age of three. And they start programming them - George is probably familiar with some of these people that have gone through this stuff. You know, they teach them to kill, they make their first kill before they're five years old. They are bred for this. They are part of the Family system - more on the Black Sun side of things - and if, you know, your father was in, more likely the son can be in, or the daughter.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:34:22</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  They also pull people in who exhibit exemplary skills in some way, shape, or form that they can utilize for their agenda. Those people, sometimes they disappear and you see them on a milk carton. Sometimes they target, they like to target a specific profile, whereby, you know, no friends, no real family relationships, that type of thing. So that's kind of how these people get into it. They... not all, in the past... are exactly human. Some of them come from the Manchurian program, which is... a human-hybrid program. Sometimes they're infected with something intentionally. So they become kind of what you call like a 'human hybrid,' almost like a possessed person. Basically they let that thing inside them. They ask for it to come inside them.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:35:29</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  I'm sure you probably know those people too, George, right? (George: Horrible.) So that's kind of who they are. They obviously have oaths that they take. Probably not the kind of oath any of you would take to evil things. Like George talks about the '72 Generals' a lot. You know, there are oaths to those type of beings, and sometimes they become infected with an AI that one of them controlled, which then controls their head. It's not exactly 'chipped' per se, because it's a more advanced technology than we are aware of, but something like that, which drives their brain.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:36:21</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  With the absence of that happening, you can see clearly in the mainstream media right now what happens to them when their chip's not going to the top - their elevator is not going to the top anymore. They're haphazard, they're making rash decisions, it's not orchestrated - the movie looks flawed. It would be like having a movie where the bloopers are left in. That's what you're seeing coming out now because they don't have that knowledge being fed to their head by some demon somewhere.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:36:56</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Rose:  And so how many of them are left? Like, what are we dealing with at this point in time?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:37:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  You know, they're always recruiting new people. So what I'm seeing a lot of is you would take like - and I'm not saying he was recruited, so don't take this the wrong way - but like a Navy SEAL, CIA agent, Mike Jecko/Jaco, you know, and their lifelong dream when they get to that level is to move up in the ranks. You know, they wanna be the general, they wanna be the top. So they're pulling those type of people - that are kind of on the agenda and familiar with the agenda - aside, and they're recruiting those people.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:37:38</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  So to say - as far as their hybrid nature, their AI connection to their head and all that kind of stuff - that part is waning. Their ability to use technologies left here by non-people is pretty much nil at this point. Are they still trying? Yes, constantly. Constantly trying to do something evil to humanity - generate Dark energy so that they can get some energy going to some kind of technology that forwards their agenda. What I'm seeing is they're pulling the Juan O'Savins of the world in - that's a 107 DARPA-Coin guy. They're pulling all of these people in. If you look at the other DARPA-Coin-list people, you'll see Dick Cheney on there. We all know how lovely he is. So as far as pulling the Mike Jecko/Jayco/Yaco guys out of the world, into the world of this type of stuff - that's what they're doing, that's why it almost looks like they're breeding - but they're just pulling in new recruits.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:38:47</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Next is Debbie. Debbie, hi, welcome to the show. And what's your question this evening?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:38:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Debbie:  Well, I just want to tell both - to you and Kim - I watch you both. And Kim, I've followed you now... oh, [for] some time. So, I'd like you both to see me as a supporter, and I'd like you to also understand where I feel like a lot of people are at. I'd say my husband and I are in our 60s. We come from a conservative background. I would say we're very spiritual. I think pretty grounded. And so, when we first saw Kim, it was with Kerry [Cassidy]. Very unusual to see you, Kim - like you said, a blonde. So, and every - all the things you present about yourself are exactly what I think people would think. So when you come onto the scene and you're introducing concepts that are essentially foreign to probably most people, I would say - you know, George has certain elements he picks up on. All of us would relate to some of the things that you're talking about.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:39:56</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Debbie:  But the knowledge that you have is so diverse - it's what caught my attention and why I watch you every time you're on. (Kim: Aww. [smiling])
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:40:06</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Debbie:  So, this has been really troubling for our family, though. I want you to understand - these concepts of AI and God and different things you're presenting that are so foreign, the average person has trouble connecting those dots to bring them into the world you're trying to expose them to. They're over here in the 'savior world,' hoping someone will help.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:40:33</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Debbie:  And so, when you see Trump go to the Carolinas or anywhere - attacking the Justice Department, doing anything that we know bothers all of us - you do feel that someone is standing up for you. The problem I have in my 60s - and I'm in the medical field - so imagine someone in the medical field who looks around at the diets and still doesn't know what to eat, right? That's how confused our society really is right now. (Kim: Yes.) So, when we see someone like you come into the picture and they barely say your name, right? They don't want to publicize you too much, so people will not go listen, right?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:41:15</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Debbie:  But my point is - that's the very reason I do listen to you - is because you're breaking all the rules, and somehow you're getting to break them. And you have United Network News, and if you listen, it only has good stuff on it. So what's the fuss about, right? But the concepts you talk about - a normal person asks themselves, why should I believe Kim? Who is Kim? How old is Kim?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:41:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Debbie:  You know, we can all accept that God can appoint any messenger, whoever you want to call God - that he appoints his own. (Kim: Yeah.) But that's the problem we have as people right now - all the trust barriers have been broken. So the society is so broken down in their ability to connect to anyone with trust - besides what they can actually see. Like, that's what's a great point about your news network - when you have average guys going out and doing news, seeing it with your own eyes - it's just a fabulous concept when you think about it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:42:25</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Debbie:  But you know, these are the things I would say to you as a listener. There are so many spaces, and when you're talking about, 'Yes, Trump did this when he turned this age - they all do this.' This is all their motives and all. And it's all very interesting how you attack it - or you don't attack it. But the point is, the average listener - I mean, it's all a 'green screen' to a lot of folks. And they don't know - they just absolutely do not know who to listen to, who to believe, who's got the best screen, who's the best savior. This is troubling to the whole world - not just U.S. folks. And when I watch both of you, I feel good spirits from you. I want you to know - I listened to 107 [Juan O'Savin] for a very long time, too - until, you know, I saw too many boots and rings. That's when I was disenchanted. My husband's laughing because, you know, this is just how it's been for us. And we want/people want truth. But they want some kind of way to believe you. They want to have evidence of things, and I don't know how the evidence could be given to people.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:43:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Debbie:  But, you know, my poor husband - sitting here trying to be nice to me every night as I listen to you - because he's a Trump supporter. But he listens to you every time you're on, too - decent guy, you know - because he opens the door to your reality, your proposals, your presentation of your paradigm. And we'd all like to go with you. And I wish you could address these thoughts.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:44:06</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Well, Deb. I gotta cut you off there. Sorry, I don't mean to, but I have a few other questions to take. On my end, the only thing I could say is that you pray for discernment. And God will allow you to see what you need to see or believe what you need to believe. You follow your gut instincts. If you want to get into science or you want facts, well, the same Trump that was in office four years ago isn't the same height, isn't the same size, and doesn't look the same. His wife doesn't kiss him. They don't sleep in the same bed. His sons aren't at the same place that he is; it's not the same. Now, maybe that's just me and maybe he shrunk and that's possible of course. But -
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:44:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  I would like some of that. Can you just, you know, [lose] five pounds, maybe 10, you know? No gym, just shrink. Poof.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:45:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Sure.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:45:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Debbie:  Yeah. Yeah. And you know, when I ask and say these things, it's with total respect, not even a morsel of disrespect.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:45:10</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  No, and I do understand what you're saying. And again, I'm here to put the information out. Now I would ask you some questions. So to somebody who, you know, like your husband, that is definitely a Trump follower. You got to - if you really want the answers, you've got to do the work. Okay? It's not about following me. It's not about following George. You've got to do the work yourself, because once you start connecting the dots yourself, things make sense to you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:45:48</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Now, first thing is, I would say, who founded the United States of America? It's a well-known fact it was a group of Masons. Where is the main Mason Lodge today, and always has been? Well, it's in the United Kingdom. You know, maybe you could look up some information about that.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:46:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Why is the largest Freemason temple, so to speak, in the country, the George Washington Freemason Temple just outside of Washington, D.C.? And why does it have all these symbols on it that you know to be not good? And what do those symbols mean? And maybe you should look them up for yourselves.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:46:30</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  So, when you think about the founding of government - the very base root of government - where did it come from? In every country? It doesn't matter if you're here from Canada or Africa, it doesn't matter. Do the homework, do it yourself, find out for yourself. What's the Federal Reserve? Read 'The Creature From Jekyll Island.' Try to understand Treasury, where it comes from. The information is out there - at least the dots. And all I'm here to do is try to help you connect them. I give the information because there are a lot of people that listen, and when things are going on that are not so good out there, they feel it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:47:12</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  And if you had a really good friend, let's just say, a neighbor, a friend, someone you've known for 20 years - that's how I look at all of you. And so if you knew your neighbor's husband or your neighbor's wife or whatever, you know, your really good friend of yours was cheating on their spouse. Do you say something? Do you not say something? You know, do you tell your friends so they could have a better life? Do you not say anything? I mean, that's really kind of a personal decision. Do you just let them figure it out on their own? You know, all I'm here to do is help you figure it out on your own.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:47:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Look, why does he go to this, or why does she go to this bar on every Tuesday night? Why all of a sudden is she going to dance class, you know, and never danced before, ever, in their whole life? She didn't even dance at your wedding? Why is she doing that now? You know, and just point out clues. Sometimes that's the easiest way to do it, right? You give the information, to the best of your ability, and let people fill in the dots. And I'm sure George is doing the same thing, constantly - I know, I watch some of George's stuff all the time. But, you know, it's about connecting the dots, understanding things for yourself, so that it's not 'I can make a decision for you,' or 'the president can make a decision for you,' it's so you can make a decision for yourself. You know?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:48:49</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Thank you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:48:51</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  That's pretty much what I think we both do, right?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:48:54</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  100%, 100%. So don't be discouraged.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:48:57</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Debbie:  Thank you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:48:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  And you'll find that information you need. Pray on it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:49:05</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Bonnie!
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:49:06</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  It will come to you where to look.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:49:07</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Yeah, yeah, 100%. Bonnie, how are you?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:49:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Debbie:  Good. Am I? Okay, good. Thank you, George, for putting this together.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:49:15</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Thank you very much.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:49:17</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Bonnie:  Appreciate your work on this. Kim, thank you for taking time to talk to us. I am going in a different direction. I'm wondering about the Earth's magnetic poles and as they've been migrating, what's going to stop them from reversing in about 12,000 years as they have been?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:49:39</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, when you have a natural flow of energy - it's called the torus field - it's not exactly like science describes it; it actually moves in a different pattern. Because you have to look at things from counterclockwise being natural, clockwise not being natural. So Earth has this as well. And it is a living being. And your torus doesn't always point north. So in other words, the place where all that energy comes into your body is not linear; that's not normal. So the original creation of magnetic poles in Earth, of which there are 10,368,000, by the way, there were. The original creation of those poles was meant to stifle the energy of Earth, therefore stifling the energy to you and all the inhabitants that Earth has. So that being said, naturally speaking, it is normal for Earth's magnetic field to change just like yours does - constantly, as a living natural being.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:50:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  As far as Earth's poles shifting, it doesn't mean what people think it actually means. They think the Earth is gonna flip upside down. Now, that would take some pretty serious alien technology to make it happen - it's not a natural occurrence. But if Earth's poles in the past - where the North is the South, South is the North - so I would say the South Pole was pointed towards Anti-Source or darkness, and the north was pointed towards Source and it was supposed to be a balance and the equator would kind of be somewhere in the middle - that's the magnetic equator, not the drawn-on equator that we have. If the poles were to flip, that would mean that the pole that was pointed towards Source is now pointed down and Dark. And could they maintain that polarity, you know, on the top? Like, it wouldn't - we would have an energetic disturbance, but as it relates to like our moon and those types of things, that's what keeps the water flowing in the right direction, that magnetic pull.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:52:12</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Bonnie:  Every 12,000 years, there's been... places that are deserts now, they can find where they were green and lush before.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:52:21</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Yep, yep. Absolutely, and that's all been done. The first place actually that Marduk et. al. landed was in the Middle East, and there's a lot of small parts in history that will tell you that they existed there - the names I mentioned. But they're mentioned as heroes, which tells you who writes our history, right? Or rewrites our history to paint these people out to be positive beings so that you want to worship them, right? That's what people used to do in the region, right? When we didn't have TV and social media and all that kind of stuff. So that was that desert, and the northern African desert with the Sahara, were the first two deserts created on earth - by two separate incidences during wars. So it wasn't a natural occurrence.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:53:19</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  The oceans receding, yes, we had more ocean in certain areas and less in others. And it is not a naturally occurring climate-change-baloney-type situation. But it was all orchestrated. When you have that much control over Earth's 'magnetic field,' which I use that term loosely - but Earth's magnetic field - you can do a lot of really evil things.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:53:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  It's kind of like directed energy weapons in California. A small natural disaster, which doesn't seem small when you're living in it. Imagine having directed energy weapons that are not our atypical [typical] Lockheed Martin things. They're much bigger and much larger. For lack of a better term, I call them vortexes and magnets and supervoids and all kinds of things that are out there that will actually - you can turn it on and turn it off, and move lots of things around on earth. Create fires, move oceans around. Think about if you had two or three different vacuum cleaners, and you put a ball in the middle of the vacuum cleaners - if you have pretty decent vacuum cleaners, that is [chuckle] - you didn't buy it on an infomercial. But, you know, you move the little hoses around, you're going to move the ball this way, it's going to roll that way, it's going to pull - and think about millions and millions of those types of things acting on Earth all at the same time. Can you imagine the changes it could make?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:54:58</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Bonnie:  You have confirmed the Earth is round.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:55:01</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  It's round.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:55:02</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Bonnie:  Thank you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:55:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Thank you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:55:04</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Bonnie:  Yeah, thank you for your time.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:55:06</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  No problem. All right. We got one last question. I can't take any more. Tammy's been waiting patiently. So, Tammy, you are the last question for tonight. What is your question? And thank you for waiting. Tammy, are you there? Tammy? We'll give you another second; you gotta unmute yourself.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:55:30</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Tammy:  Can you hear me?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:55:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  I can hear you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:55:35</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Tammy:  Oh my God, I'm so excited! Kim, you're amazing, and from all your UNN followers: we absolutely love that you exist. Because, I mean, with discernment, it's amazing to have you to come to three times a week and hear the truth. So I applaud you. I love you. You're so welcome. So my question is about C.A.R.E. I love God. I love life. I have a lot of children. But I've been struck with immense trauma since I was very small, and so that's led me to have like, the last, I don't know, 25 years trying to heal myself. I even went to Peru last month to do ayahuasca because I felt so blocked in all my stuff. So I'm wondering, do you see C.A.R.E. coming in soon so that the people who love God and want to help, like, because I have two children that are from Lahaina. I love Lahaina. I want to help. I helped recently just deliver food and water and peace and stuff, but I have so much healing to do still. I really want to have naturopathic healing. I want to have structured water. I want to have frequencies. How soon can we expect C.A.R.E. to help us?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:57:01</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  I am going to stick with what I know so far, which is it's going to be a bumpy ride the rest of this month, probably pretty bumpy the first week or two in February, and then from there on out it should be smooth sailing. That's what I've been told, and that's what I've been promised. So I'm going to stick with, stick with, keep doing everything I can do. And, you know, when Source says it's time, it's time. I wish I could push it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:57:31</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  You know, and truth be told, from my standpoint, you know, it's horrible to have me watch a lot of the things I watch and see and not be able to change it. But everything in its right time - even watching the war in Gaza as an example - and I also got to see the other side of that war too. Meaning I saw the people, you know, building fires and making bread and handing out the food, and somebody else is making beans, and you know, they did it together. And it's the same way it's always been. That's what C.A.R.E. is all about. That's what UNN is about as well. It's about the people doing it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:58:29</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Tammy:  And Lahaina did that too. The FEMA camps and everything tried to come in - but they were just like right outside of reach. You know, you couldn't even get to them. People who needed them couldn't even get to them. And it was the people who came by boats and brought gas and water and food, and it was beautiful. So I know what you're saying.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:58:48</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  You know, and it's a terrible occurrence when these types of things happen - they have their own agenda - but it doesn't ever get the people down. You know, we rise to the occasion. And as far as traumas, we've all got it - we've all lived in an environment that has just been so horrific for humans. You know, we don't know who to trust, who to believe, what to believe anymore. It's getting more and more so in that way. That's part of it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:59:22</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  But the other part of it too is that, you know, it's like, as a kid, a young kid, they say that if your parents let you down, you're not going to trust anybody the rest of your life. You're gonna have a hard - you're gonna have trust issues, so to speak. Because that's the person that's supposed to nurture you and care for you, especially those that have been abused physically or whatever by their parents.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>00:59:45</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  And you have to think of humanity kind of in the same way. All those that we're supposed to be able to trust that are quote-unquote leaders that have let us down repeatedly over and over and over again. And then we find out things like the things George knows, you know, about what they do behind the scenes. And it's horrific.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:00:06</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Tammy:  So what's your best advice as far as, okay, I want to be close to God, I want to bring in all that Source Light energy. I know I've had trauma, but I've worked on it. So what is the best way for me to open up and receive that, so that I can become a good steward of that Light as well to go on?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:00:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, think about it this way. So your trauma is your trauma, right? And if your child went through some trauma, say, what would you do for them? You know, as a mom, I can say for my own self, I try to take away as much pain from my child as possible. So they never shed a tear, so they never cry, right? That's just me. And when my child is upset - if your kids are okay, you're okay - if the kids are not okay, you're not okay. And what do you think Source thinks of you? Or God?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:01:01</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Tammy:  Yeah, the same. The same.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:01:03</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  He thinks the same of you. And don't you think he wants to take that away?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:01:11</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Tammy:  Yeah, it's the releasing of it though, you know, without having guilt and shame and fear and all these things. I mean, you know, finally be rid of them.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:01:20</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, and and remember, when you think of God or you think - you need to think of him like he's a parent. Like, what would you do if your kids were hurting? Would you want them to carry that hurt and that pain? Would you try to do all the practices or everything you've learned to try to help them? Of course you would.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:01:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Tammy:  Yes.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:01:42</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  You know, and there is no such thing with God as guilt and shame. There is nothing you can do in your life that is gonna make God turn away from you, I can tell you that with 100% certainty. You know, it's the same thing with you turning away from your kids. Would you ever turn away from your kids - fully?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:02:01</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Tammy:  No.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:02:01</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  You know? And please think about it like he's your father, because that's the way, like the best father anybody could ever have, because that is exactly how it is. And give him your trauma. Give him, give it to him. He wants to take it from you. Why are you denying him? Wouldn't you be sad if your kids denied the fact that you could actually help them with something and they won't let you help?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:02:35</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Tammy:  Absolutely.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:02:36</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, you've got some powerful force out there that wants to help you every day. And it's painful for him to feel like you won't do it. Why won't you let me help you? Why do you wanna hang on to this? Why can't I help you? So you gotta think about it that way. He loves you just as much as you love your kids.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:03:13</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Hopefully that helps. Thank you.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:03:14</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Tammy:  It does.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:03:15</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Thank you, Tammy.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:03:17</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Kim, another interesting Q&A. Appreciate you taking the time from your day. I know it's very hectic, and you took the time to answer these people, and it means a lot to talk to people on my platform and some of yours who come on board on my platform. I appreciate it. I know you're busy. I think everyone appreciates what you're trying to do. I think overall your message is positive, which I believe is that you should not believe in one person as a savior - there is no savior. But you know, believe in yourself and your family. Do what's right for you and them, and believe in God.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:03:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  I believe in God. I thank God. Without him, I wouldn't be here today doing what I do and knowing anything or anything, anything. The shirt on my back, I'm blessed, and I'm thankful every single day, and like you said, interestingly enough, usually my talks are in the morning. I find that's the best time for my meditation and prayer, or I have a conversation with God.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:04:13</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  And if I can give everyone any type of advice, I've said it in the past to my viewers, is have a relationship with God. Just like a father and his son, or a father and his daughter, have a relationship with him. Talk to him, speak to him, give him thanks and appreciation for the wonderful things he does, not just in your life, but all around us in this amazing world that we live in.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:04:41</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  There are beautiful things that are happening. And I have faith, Kim. I have faith that good things are coming and God is going to show us miracles. They're happening every single moment, every day, all around us. We just have to hang in there. That's all I can say. Stay strong, guys. Have faith. Get outside, get that fresh air, get that vitamin D. Play with your friends. Go play with your dog. Go for a walk. Go for a swim. Do something fun. Let your feet touch the grass. Go barefoot, feel that energy in your body, and appreciate all the beautiful things. What I'm basically saying is raise your vibration - don't lower your vibration.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:05:24</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  And when you're watching this fear porn, they do one thing and one thing only, and that's to feed off your loosh. They're soul suckers, and they're going to use that in some type of magical ritual when you give them permission. So don't do it. Don't be sad, don't be angry, don't be upset, don't be in fear. That's what, reverse it on them. Be happy, be in love, and give thanks and praise. Kim, anything you'd like to share before we sign off?
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:05:50</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Well, I just wanted to say thank you to everybody. I know it's late where some of you are, so I appreciate you all coming and being here tonight. It actually gives me a lot of... It makes me happy to have these conversations because I get to reach out and talk to all of you. We used to do it all the time, every Sunday. We don't do it like that anymore, and it's just become a little bit too difficult to do it in that way.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:06:16</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  But I'm thankful when George allows me to come on, and we get to have these conversations, and I get to talk to all of you lovely people. And you make it all worthwhile. You know, as difficult as it is some days where I am just trying to get through the day or the night or whatever it is, because it doesn't necessarily stop just because it's quote-unquote time to relax and go to sleep. It doesn't always work out that way. But you truly make it all worthwhile.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:06:53</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  It's you that gets me up every day. It's you that keeps me going. It's Source that helps me along the way. And we're partners in life, and you know, but truly, to be able to fulfill your dreams of the things that you want to do for all of humanity, and it really it's people like you that make it all worthwhile. I mean, truly. So thank you. And thank you, George, for having me on. I appreciate it.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:07:26</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>George:  Thank you for being here. God bless you, Kim. God bless everybody for watching, and we'll see you next time. Peace and out, everyone.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:07:32</small></small>
        <br>
        <br>Kim:  Good night, everyone.
        <br>
        <small><br><small>01:07:33</small></small>
