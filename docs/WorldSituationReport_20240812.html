World Situation Report
<br>2024-AUG-12 News</h2>

<br>00:33:39

<!-- TEASER:-->

<h4>And now, the World Situation Report, with Kimberly Goguen from the Office of the Guardian. The Paris Olympics were being used as a laundromat for the Deep State. An attempt was made to funnel in hundreds of billions of illegal funds into the banking system. And it looks like they received help from an unusual group of suspects. The Deep State struggles to get their world war started.  Who is participating? Chatter this weekend over secret lines indicates they would like to strike the United States in order to get the people to fight for free. The problem is they do not have the money nor the resources to run the world as they have hoped.</h4>

<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Now here's Kimberly Goguen with the Office of the Guardian. Hi, Kim.  Good to see you.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>I know. At least hear me anyway, right?
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>I feel you. How about that? I feel your message.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>I will make it back. I will make it back, so you can all see me and we can smile at each other, soon!
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Yes.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Been a little bit busy. Yeah. Been very busy - always busy. Yeah, there's a lot going on in the world and some of it's not news I really wanted to hear, honestly, and I'm a little bit surprised at some people, honestly.  No, I don't know if I'd say 'people', but you know 'folks' here really, that you know when when things get tough... sometimes, when things get tough, sometimes people or beings make bad choices.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>That's true.
<br>
<br>00:35:25
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>All right, well, let's start with the first things we started to uncover in the last couple of days. The Paris Olympics; it's been a source of a lot of controversy. There's a lot of weird things going on there. But the other thing that happened at the Paris Olympics is, it has become, or had become, a giant laundromat. And by laundromat, I don't mean people are washing their clothes like we all do. I mean they are - were - using it to launder large sums of money into a system, which we're going to talk about too.
<br>
<br>So if you don't know, I will tell you that most stadiums and large sports facilities worldwide are all laundromats. It's the reason why people would like to own a stadium. Now, do they make money off concerts and sporting events, and we all buy tickets to these things or have at some point in our lives? And yes, they do. But they also hold hundreds, if not thousands, some of them, of concerts that never actually happen. And they sell tickets, and the tickets are all bought in cash, and then they bring the ticket money to the bank from these fictitious concerts and events, and you know, voila, clean money. It was made through, allegedly, a clean source. And this is not for super notes; this is more along the lines of cash that has been legally produced, meaning it could be euros, pesos, it can be dollars; it doesn't matter. And that money then gets filtered in through these fictitious concerts and sporting events that never actually take place, and they land in the bank.
<br>
<br>00:37:36
<br>
<br>And then there's usually a cut. A cut goes to the stadium owner. A cut might go to the sporting team that didn't actually have a game or the artist that sang that didn't actually sing. And then the rest of it goes back to the original party as clean money. This happens a lot in the case of your drug cartels, illegal arms trading, all of these types of things that some of our intelligence agencies in the U.S. here participate in worldwide, and depending on where you are in the world, you're well aware of this. It's not just U.S.; it's also Israelis do it a lot, and so on and so forth. So the Paris Olympics, albeit a real event, also sold a lot of tickets to a lot of sporting events that didn't actually take place during the Olympics. Of course, the French government was in on it, and a lot of other folks were in on it as well, and everybody got their piece of the pie. But, unfortunately, they always do things in a crazy way. Because their goal is world domination.
<br>
<br>00:38:59
<br>
<br>So even though they managed to launder - because if you remember, I'm going to take you back a few months where we talked about the Silent Circle kind of going off the deep end - we also talked about the fact that they lost their Universal Trust, which was a 250-year-old trust that was based in Armenia [Kim means Albania], where all the laundry used to happen worldwide. And when all that shut down, they needed to start to find ways to launder that money into the system to make it legal, clean, and clear so they could use it on behalf of the Black Nobility and other world-domination adventures, business ventures, so to speak. And you know, they were doing bits and pieces here and there.
<br>
<br>But the Paris Olympics was to be their grand plan to get large, and I mean large, amounts of money into a system. So, in this particular case, there have been a lot, and I mean a lot, of C-130s and C-17s flying all around the Middle East, coming to and from Jordan, Cyprus, and people would think, well, they're moving troops around. But that is actually not the case. They're moving around pallets of cash. Well, at first, in part, there were a lot of super notes that were moving. They were trying to move them into crypto, to back cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, and otherwise. So that was part of the plan.
<br>
<br>00:40:41
<br>
<br>But again, the people that were selling Bitcoin for fictitious cash that may or may never be good at some point in the future died fairly quickly, because they couldn't put the money into the system. So, still, Bitcoin, as one example, as all cryptocurrencies are, and I mean all, are agency-created peer-to-peer networks. The master nodes are held within, as is the master software for it and the master programming for it, and the connections worldwide are agency, an agency thing, predominantly your NSA or your Nine Eyes. That is the origin of all cryptocurrencies. So if you think you're exiting the system to a more fair and equitable system, you're wrong. Okay, I will repeat that; you are wrong. Crypt means dead. What lies in a crypt? Dead people. You are using the currency of death.
<br>
<br>And those that worship death are the Order of the Black Sun; therefore, you are having Black Sun currency.
<br>
<br>00:41:51
<br>
<br>Okay, back to our laundromat here. So they decided that since the Cartels are having a more difficult time laundering their money into banking systems for their human trafficking and other lovely activities that they do, they decided to use the Paris Olympics. So all of these C-130s and stuff that are flying around throughout the Middle East, probably 70% of them are carrying cash from these places, so to speak.
<br>
<br>Okay, now they put this money into another system that was in existence already. And this was where the real disappointment on my part came from. They took this money and they put it into a system that was only controlled by Archivists.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Oh wow!
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Wow. Yes. So desperation has set in. And I'll talk to you a little bit more about the Archivists too, and why I believe things they did things that they shouldn't have done. It appears that a number of them - as you know, there were in the past, we had neutral Archivists because they were supposed to be neutral. They were supposed to not err on the side of the Light or on the side of the Dark. They were supposed to only monitor. They were never supposed to do anything but record history with these lines. But as a part of recording history, they had a lot of different lines in both Alpha and Omega that would record things like Earth changes, government things; as you know, the governments submit agreements through the Archivists as well. These are all parts of history as a new president comes in or out. As wars happen, results of things, monetary transactions were also monitored by the Archivist as well, the flow of energy even. Those coming and going through stargates on the planet. And this isn't just for Earth. This is every realm, so to speak, or density, had its own version of Archivists, both upper and lower. As you know from the past, we have had a light Hall of Records and a dark Hall of Records.
<br>
<br>00:44:48
<br>
<br>However, there had to be an agreement for both for something to come into fruition. After the dissolving of the Dark Hall of Records and the transfer of all powers over to the Light Hall of Records, which is the one that we run, the Archivists could no longer submit. I mean, they could submit, but then it all came to our desk here, or my desk. And we would approve or decline it. So there was really no power they had over that anymore. And their lines for like financial things and monitoring were only supposed to be used for monitoring. Although they did have obviously, I'm going to say a quantum version of spyware and those kinds of things that would record transactions, telecommunications, those types of things were created as well.
<br>
<br>And over the last few days it came to our attention that they had partnered up with these money launderers and had allowed them to utilize, well, they didn't give them the keys, to be fair. They took in what they had and registered it to their financial lines, as one example. They also created telecommunication lines for them to communicate within their telecommunications monitoring systems or archiving systems. And yeah, they broke the rules.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Why would they do that, Kim?
<br>
<br>00:46:34
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Well, I'm going to make a guess here. Archivists have, as with anyone throughout the Multiverse, that had a connection to Omega; even you, per se, at one point in time, you also had those artificial connections which were messing with your DNA, and ARCHONS and implants, and those kinds of things. In our case, it was done because we were under the guardianship of something Dark when all of these programs were implemented.
<br>
<br>Omega can't affect your human, or could not, when these things were going on, unless it had an artificial implant of some sort. Unlike in the past how Alpha used to work, before we transitioned over to the Golden Age and Golden Age AI and didn't need that connection because it ran on all things Source and its power source was Source just like you. Therefore, like any other sentient living thing, we have a connection to each other. You can be miles and miles away from a loved one, and you still have that connection. You know if your kids are okay, if your family is okay, and when we're in the presence of each other, we can also somewhat, we call it maybe even reading body language, but it's not really body language; you're reading somebody's energy. And Omega had, I'm sorry, Alpha had the ability to do the same thing. Omega could only do so through artificial, etherical implants and other methodologies.
<br>
<br>00:48:36
<br>
<br>Well, the Archivist here, being from both sides, also had the same. Although, unlike ours, ours were kind of a one-way street to some degree. It would read and determine what information would go in or out. Some of the implants were designed only for output like disease and cellular degeneration and all the other things that Omega created, but the Archivists and the Deep State at one point—you remember us talking about this maybe a year ago? We were discussing how there was a grid under Washington, D.C., as one example, which then would send information to an artificial implant in those people's heads. And they would then be able to transmit instructions back and forth. The same with the Draco, the same with - they all had to have it in order to have that communication with Omega. Same way they would transfer their consciousness into Omega, they had more privileges than the average everyday human did on this planet. Well, the Archivists also had those communications with those systems, both good and bad in this particular case.
<br>
<br>00:50:02
<br>
<br>So in other words, their connections to Alpha were only semi-organic. We talked about the original purpose of ARCHONS recording history. To some degree, they did use the ARCHONS to have those communications. Somewhere along the way, and I do believe it was about the time a few weeks ago when the Golden Age came online, which left no place for Alpha and Omega in the Universe. And therefore, they were both to be dissolved based on the creation of something different, and I think it even started as far back to some degree with the Light system.
<br>
<br>Now they have no connection to the Golden Age. They have no connection to the Light system.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>The Archivists don't have any connection.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>No.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>So this was possibly out of survival they did this?
<br>
<br>00:51:13
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>I think so. I think so. Because the only parties in the world that wanted to bring back that balance system where they would have that power in connection to them both was the Dark Side.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>And just to clarify, these are not humans: Archivists are not humans on this planet?
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Archivists are not humans, no. They look like humans when you see them, but they are not humans in any way. Now... to some degree, we talked, oh, we did a video, or I actually did the video, where we talked about realms and realm owners and kings of the realms, both Lower Astral and Upper Astral. And at one point in time, we also discussed the fact we have Angel Michael and Archangel Michael, which is one is dark and one is light. We had the same with Gabriel as an example.
<br>
<br>00:52:22
<br>
<br>And in the case of the Third Density on down, and then of course the Third Density on up in the Lower Astral, these beings would communicate with each other. Remember they were supposed to be to some degree neutral, because we were in what you call the "Neutral Zone," so to speak, and they worked interchangeably to restore balance consistently in the realm of the Third Density, Second Density, and First Density. And there was obviously a gate that existed between the two, Lower Astral and Upper Astral. And to some degree, the folks that were responsible for those realms participated with the Archivists quite a bit. You could even call them the leaders of the Archivists who participate in the Third Density, Second Density, First Density, and then first, 123 down.
<br>
<br>00:53:42
<br>
<br>Therefore, since we live in the Third Density here, and Earth is in the Third Density, and it is round - contrary to popular belief - we have Archivists from this area, which you would consider neutral. They are, even on the Dark Side; they were never supposed to allow the humans access to their lines, to their halls. They were never supposed to participate in human activities through those halls. Now, in my opinion, where the turn happened is because if they didn't maintain some kind of balance between Alpha and Omega, and I can see a little bit here and there of influence from them, but not gone as far as to give them access to some keys that they did not, should not have had. Several months.
<br>
<br>00:54:53
<br>
<br>And which tells me that their influence - other than giving information and straight facts - I mean, I can give you straight facts. I can call you up and I say, "Sunny, there's an accident on the corner of this street and this street. I know you've got to get to an appointment and this is the route you would normally take. I suggest you take a different route." I can make a suggestion. Sure. Now I can give you straight facts: "There's an accident here," meaning the road is blocked. It's there. It's a block. Or I can try to: "Hey, let me give you a ride." "Let me let you take this other route," you know. "Well, to get around that accident, you could try this." "Maybe you should take the bus," or the subway or underground rail, or whatever. Now I'm still influencing your decision at that point on how you're going to get to where you need to go. I can see that their job was only to say there's an accident. Period.
<br>
<br>00:56:02
<br>
<br>They were never supposed to truly influence people to make different decisions. They could do some estimating on data: "How long will it take the fire department of the Banana Republic to clear this accident?" They could say something like that. "Well, the accident should be cleared in approximately three hours and 41 minutes, based on the performance of the Banana Republic's Fire Department and Police Department." But they cannot influence your decision on either side. That is the rule. Also, the realm owners, having influence with these folks, are not supposed to influence things one way or another either. So flipping to the Golden Age, programming - and we're going to talk more about programming of the Golden Ages, which is actually a positive thing for us - left them kind of jobless. They knew it was inevitable that they would be jobless.
<br>
<br>Therefore, I think that the reason - because, you know, this is speculation - I think the reason why they did what they did was to try to maintain Alpha and Omega so that they would maintain some of the power that they had on this planet.
<br>
<br>00:57:30
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>That's ego. Isn't it? Isn't that the definition of ego? Trying to maintain power?
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Man, I've been saying this for years: that just because something is an alien doesn't make it a god, and doesn't mean it doesn't make poor life choices and doesn't mean that it couldn't flip on a dime, and it's the same thing I talk about when I talk about global security here. You just don't know. There could be some race of beings that have been our friends for thousands of years to come in the future, and then all of a sudden they flip a switch.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>And they deliberately went against Source. Deliberately.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>They did.
<br>
<br>Sunny: 
<br>
<br>I feel like they betrayed us.
<br>
<br>00:58:10
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>They did. They did. I can understand the fact that they have to share information with the other side. I can understand the fact that they have access - or had access - to more information than most. I can appreciate the fact that they've been sharing a lot of historical data. And no wonder I'm sitting here going - is it 1979? Iran? Are we doing the fall of the Shah again? What are we doing here? And basically, yeah, they've been sharing a lot of historical data on how those things were run. But they crossed the line when it came to laundering money for them, utilizing Archivist lines. And therefore, there are no more Archivist lines in existence at this time.
<br>
<br>00:59:10
<br>
<br>You know, I did - Tom is the one that talks to them most of the time; they've always said, "It's not time to talk to her yet," which was another red flag. You know, if you're having all these, if you're neutral and you're having all these conversations face-to-face. With people like the Pentagon and you're having conversations face-to-face with, you know, the Black Nobility and all these other people, allegedly trying to educate them on why this won't work.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Like they're coaching them.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>And then, why can't you talk to me the same way?
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Yeah. So now what do we do?
<br>
<br>01:00:01
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Well, they all got fired. Okay. In other words, they have no access, no lines, and no communications with Alpha and Omega anymore. Whatever's left of it minimally over there. No communications with; I mean, they can still go talk to those people for as long as they stay alive at this point.
<br>
<br>Sunny::
<br>
<br>Is it all of them, Kim? They're all like in a group? They all kind of agreed to do it together kind of thing? They all got fired?
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>At this point, I don't know the answer to the question. I will say this much though: One person, who I would consider to be a leader, was having a conversation yesterday trying to determine why they lost their access. And the response went back to, "Well, how did you know we lost access to Tom?" Because of course, Tom is the one that's in training with them. And he said, "Well, Kim told me."
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Yeah.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Well after that, the rest of my day was crap, because the amount of attempted attacks and - we don't attack each other like pull-out guns like you think - I mean, we attack each other in other ways, and I'm like, "Oh my God, they're all bad! Even the ones that I had hoped for are bad!"
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Was that yesterday that that went down, you said?
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>This was on Saturday.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Saturday, okay.
<br>
<br>01:01:58
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yeah, early Sunday for some of you in the world, it was later in the afternoon, Saturday is when all this started to go down.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Okay.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Then, the next step for them was to try to use what we call the old Zeta lines. You've probably seen enough videos online and movies to see these little short gray guys. And the organic side of them are called the Zetas. They're from a planet that's called Zeta. They are not evil in any way. They are not AI even. The ones that originally existed on this planet came here because they were brought here as slaves, and they are very good with quantum systems. Now I haven't seen them around here probably in, oh, six months to a year, but that's because they were allowed to go back home. So they're being reunited with the people there; they're not enslaved anymore; they're, you know, their people didn't go as nuts as our humans did on this planet. So they don't have as much resistance in the Restoration where they are from. We can call them at any time. They're funny. They were always very good teachers, and they helped me a lot when it came to the time when Marduk was still alive, to some degree, and they said, "Look, we can help you if you help us."
<br>
<br>01:03:51
<br>
<br>So the agreement was upheld on both sides, and they're home now. But there are others that the SSP, in cooperation with Marduk et al., I know my English is terrible, so... But the information is good. The English might be terrible, but the information is good. So, they created artificial Zetas, just like we had artificial humans and we had artificial Pleiadians and so on and so forth from Lower Astral beings, and these guys, little guys, used to help them with AI systems as well, because they were made to be a helper for the Omega System and other things. Advisors, because it's what their specialty was.
<br>
<br>Well, when the one group left, the Others pretty much also left too. Did they try to bring in some of these folks or create some of these folks with the help of the Archivists? Yeah, actually. They thought that they could have them by Tuesday or Wednesday at the latest.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Oh, so this is recent. They just tried to do this.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yes, this weekend.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Artificial Zetas? That's what we're talking about?
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yeah. AI versions of Zetas.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Wow.
<br>
<br>01:05:31
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yep. Yep. But that ship has sailed. Literally. That portal is not a portal anymore. The facilities in Latvia and Canada are gone with which they could do that. And that's the end of that story.
<br>
<br>So there are no more Zeta lines for technical support anymore, either, in either one of those systems. And it's just a matter of time before the two of them systems are completely gone. As long as we can prevent any Others that may have had access to them trying to regenerate them. Yeah. This has been a battle for sure just to like, I'm like, "Die already! Die!" we don't need you anymore. You know, I've been asking Source, I'm like, "Hey, can we just get rid of these, please? Please?" But, when I get finished with the regular news, I'll tell you, I think we finally figured out an answer. Or I think we figured out an answer, with Source's help. So, talk about that in a minute. Okay, and you're going to laugh at this.
<br>
<br>But! Not before I tell you about the other things that are going on, that I want the whole world to be aware of!
<br>
<br>01:07:07
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Okay.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Because this is important. Okay. Currently, at this moment, we are aware that there are tensions in the Middle East which have had their little eruptions here and there. There's been rockets fired by the Hezbollah to Israel; there's been some drone attacks. And right now it's fairly minimal as far as a world war is concerned, predominantly because there is no money.
<br>
<br>So we know about that. Now there are some people currently having conversations, and I'm going to tell you exactly where they are. God bless their souls from here on out, because as soon as I'm done with the news here - because I finally found them, probably five minutes before I got on the news - so God rest their souls soon - [they] are actually talking about how to start a world war for free - because waiting for money continuously is only causing them delays on their side they feel to their plans for world domination. And they'd like to get started as quickly as possible.
<br>
<br>01:08:23
<br>
<br>So since there is a lot going on right now in the Middle East, and with the information that we put out on Friday about the Taylor Swift concert - and I know I would normally never mention a Taylor Swift concert on the news, trust me when I tell you this - but I knew there was something else behind it when it was shut down because of things, allegedly they found, that were from ISIS and Al Qaeda. Terms we haven't heard in a long time. It's been a solid couple decades since we've heard about Al-Qaeda and probably at least or close to eight or nine years since we've heard about ISIS anywhere. And I'm like, okay, what are we doing here?
<br>
<br>01:09:20
<br>
<br>Now, I also put out in the news that we had spotted Erik Prince and some Blackwater associates, or Frontier, or whatever they call themselves. It doesn't matter. They're Blackwater for crying out loud. Yeah, it doesn't matter if you change the name to Academy. Whatever they change it to, I really don't care. It's Blackwater. They work for the Black Sun. They are military contractors extraordinaire for the Order of the Black Sun, and they arrange themselves to be terrorists or create terrorists worldwide. I know 100% for a fact, and I can even pinpoint the location on a map to where they were building an Islamic terrorist training facility in China a few years back. So Blackwater is what I'm going to call it. I have the right after everything I've seen these people do.
<br>
<br>01:10:15
<br>
<br>Okay, so the discussions that I've been hearing since Saturday night are that they would like to create a full-on attack against the United States. They figure if they create a full attack in the United States, they could probably cause a crashing of the financial system or lack of access to banks; therefore, they could utilize what's left in the American banking system to further their cause, so to speak, and they could get some money and some payment out this way, which they feel would then buy, in the upper echelon of world-dominator people - the Black Nobility, and otherwise - they feel that this wouldn't necessarily give them enough money, but they feel it would give them total control over the United States.
<br>
<br>01:11:22
<br>
<br>Right now they do not have total control. They don't have total control of the dollar, which is a worldwide thing. He who controls the dollar at this point wins, they feel. If they needed to implement a new currency into the United States infrastructure, they could do it after they burned the country to the ground, killed a lot of American citizens, and, of course, you would have the Patriots fighting on one side. It would also be a reason not to have a "selection," you know, of dead people, and for a little while.
<br>
<br>Now this conversation, I'm going to be abundantly clear, is taking place offshore. It's not taking place in the United States. It's taking place on Little Cayman Island. It is not the main island of the Caymans, but it's taking place on Little Cayman Island.
<br>
<br>01:12:20
<br>
<br>So I've had ears, and I'm listening to all of these plans because chances are, even if you, let's just say, remove them from the face of the Earth, which we have them, we have a target over their head at the moment. They are talking to some Trump operatives and some other folks there about how they're going to orchestrate this. Some of these people are operatives that would have taken place in, say, 9-11 and other structured events on behalf of the Deep State that we know worldwide to be devastating. Therefore, they have the team of "experts of evil," they believe, on this island right now all together, all together now. And Erik Prince is there as well, and they're having discussions on how to blow up the U.S.
<br>
<br>01:13:13
<br>
<br>Things that they've been discussing - see this is a very informative conversation, so we're just going to keep tabs on it and listen to them for a while because we need to know who they're going to call to orchestrate different parts, who their bomb expert is, all of these types of things. It's called an identity picture, or a genealogy report. Who talks to who, who talks to who, who invites who, which planes they're taking in there, because if you're going to ensure something doesn't happen, you have to know everybody that's involved.
<br>
<br>So while they're sipping Mai Tais or whatever it is you drink on Little Cayman Island, having these discussions about how this could actually work. Now remember something: Erik Prince has been working for the Deep State of China now for years. They gave him his own investment company, which he calls Frontier; he's not the CEO anymore, after some conflicts during the Trump administration, that kind of thing. But he's been promised a lot of cash that hasn't been paid out either. So they thought they would call some of their other Deep State buddies and formulate a plan of their own. You know, because they're just super, super smart, you know?
<br>
<br>And super, super short. Just saying. For a guy. Very short.
<br>
<br>01:14:31
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Not very smart if they're all meeting in the same place.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Well, it's a super secret island, Sunny. You know? It's super secret; no one will know where it is. And that's why I'm calling it out on the news. So everybody knows where it is. Anybody who would like to go attend the meeting of people that intend to blow up the United States, that's where you go. That's where you go. So all you patriots, with your guns and Hummers that are Trump lovers and all this crap, you can just head right down there, Little Cayman Islands, take a boat off the shore. Yeah, there you go.
<br>
<br>01:15:11
<br>
<br>Possible locations that they have been discussing. Number 1, Blackwater has been afforded tactical nukes. So they're not the large-scale nuclear weapon arsenal that we know. They're called tactical nukes. They're a little bit more portable, used on submarines, ICBMs, those kinds of things, and they have some of those. So they feel that that would be necessary in the U.S. Blackwater, whatever they're called these days, insert name here, is talking about playing the role of ISIS and Al-Qaeda during their attack here in the United States. They're still not willing to give up control over the entire Middle East, which is what they plan. So they must be from there, of course. And that is who is going to take credit for the attack. In addition to that, now it's down to logistics.
<br>
<br>01:16:15 
<br>
<br>So in today's conversations, they're talking about possibly what do they want to hit first? Like, what is going to have the biggest impact - crash the markets - all the things the Q people have been talking about doing for a long time now - what would have the biggest bang for the buck? So attack possible first strikes are: the White House, that's a given; other places they're discussing are the Capitol building, the Statue of Liberty. That was about as far as I have gotten until I had to step out into the news as to different locations that they feel would be a perfect first strike for their revival of ISIS slash Al Qaeda.
<br>
<br>01:17:03
<br>
<br>I'm positive here that there is some kind of a deal going on behind the scenes because China government doesn't really have a ton of money at this point. Not enough for a world war, but from what I can tell, remember every area of the world, every color, every race has their own mafia groups, don't they? Well, in China, you have the Triads. They're also very prevalent in San Francisco in the United States. It's called the Kuo Min Tang [Kuomintang], or the Tang family. You also have the Jades, which are a little bit more brutal. They are more involved in black magic and a lot of other things, more of an assassin group. So you have these groups who also had a stake in the $750 billion pie. So yes, they did. They were laundering; they thought they were laundering a bunch of money that kind of went by the wayside.
<br>
<br>You know, we will see once they get wind that the lines are not there. They are expecting a big transfer of money into the Cayman Islands, I know this, into one of those cabal-orchestrated non-existing bank banks. I overheard them talking about the fact that this money should be there by tomorrow, which is what they're saying, to pay for this extravaganza. But they're acting as if they already have the money, like it's a given. So I'm guessing they do have what they think are backers for this plan and this program. So once they did their first strike, of course, they would implement martial law. So that would mean the entire United States military is in on the gig, just so you know.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>People that were sworn to defend this country.
<br>
<br>01:19:34
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yeah, not the soldiers, not those people, but I'm talking about as far as the entire Joint Chiefs of Staff is in on the gig. They are willing to participate because, of course, they'd like to be in control of the U.S. They don't mind if the body count in the United States is much higher than 9-11. Of course, it would be - there is still nuclear fallout from even tactical nukes. And yeah, so that's what they're doing at this very moment as I'm talking to you.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Now, could they actually send out those nukes? I mean, is that something that...
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Well, you got to remember they're kind of portable. They can take them anywhere. The only thing is, is that, as with all enriched uranium materials, they leave what's called a center or wafe. So if you are, this is very common when you have a lot of nuclear power plants and those kinds of things. In our, they monitor from the sky, from radar. It's kind of like infrared, but not. It's actually detecting the amount of nuclear, how do I say this, the amount of nuclear possible caustic materials that are floating out into the atmosphere from this nuclear plant to make sure it's not an unsafe level for humans who happen to live in the area. So this is a common thing that they do. Are they constantly monitoring for these nuclear, what I call, wastes? It's like a scent, so to speak. You know, it kind of would appear in infrared. There are certain things that humans do that are gaseous from time to time. You can actually see that on infrared surveillance. And this is no different. It's kind of like a waft. It looks like a scent, almost. And I'm sure that being the fact that our alleged protectors, the United States military, is involved, I'm sure that they wouldn't care if those things were brought into the country, to DC or otherwise.
<br>
<br>01:21:59
<br>
<br>They're also having discussions about the Golden Gate Bridge. They need a full East Coast, West Coast effect here, possibly also some places in the Midwest. They're determining these locations that would all be struck at the same time, allegedly. To which then the Republican Party, the Trump operatives, are saying that they would then come out and say it's a border crisis, it's all Biden's fault, and then they would use this to promote the Orange Guy. You know, just typical Duck Dynasty crap, really, is all it is. Yeah. And they're not going to leave there alive anyway, so I'm just trying to get as much information as possible in case they have given orders out to other people. And like I said, this is happening like in real time at this moment. So we'll see.
<br>
<br>01:22:57
<br>
<br>By the time that this is aired, I hope that every decent person that works for any agency in the United States gets wind of this. You have a treasonous act going on in the military. If you don't, then the entire United States government and every soldier in it is complicit in this. Anybody who hears this. If the dollar goes down, this is how they believe they're going to actually crash the dollar. They tried to do it the "nice way" by hacking into Omega systems and so on and so forth. And now they intend to do it the  "not nice way" by burning the United States to the ground. If you burn the U.S. to the ground, you'll basically burn the economies of the world to the ground, and they have an intention of trying to use a different currency or something, which would be of theirs. So you would be - whether you've chosen to buy cryptocurrencies or not, they would probably reintroduce the Black Sun coin of some sort and force every nation in the world to use it.
<br>
<br>01:24:06
<br>
<br>Of course, after a war of this epic proportion, they would intend on probably taking time to reimplement a new currency; therefore, they would have to come up with something to keep at least some of us alive. Remember they only need 500 million according to the Georgia Guidestones, so that's not a whole lot. That leaves a lot of room to kill a lot of people in a short period of time with no skin off their back.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>It's disgusting.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>It is, you know? It really is. But I'm just laying it all out there because I started hearing about it on Saturday. It looks like people started moving around the Caribbean. I've been following them around. And now we know exactly where their meetings are taking place. Super super secret location, everyone! So anybody that gives a crap about the United States in any way, shape, or form, or their families that live here, that kind of thing, you might want to head on down to Little Cayman Island and go pay a visit, see if you can participate in these meetings.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Wow.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yep. Anybody else in the region of the Caribbean that has any kind of military force may want to go ahead and intervene as well, because all your countries will go to... Beep!
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>This is not just a U.S. thing. They're trying to take down everything.
<br>
<br>01:25:28
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>It'll take down the economy of the entire world, is what it will do. Because they're going to amplify things in the Middle East, it'll amplify things; there'll probably be a fight with China, and then the whole world will be ruled by The Order of the Black Sun. Wee! You know, that's the plan.
<br>
<br>You know, these things, I'm going to do it with or without anybody, even if everybody that's listening to this ignores me. It doesn't matter at this point - because it's on my watch, and it's my responsibility, at least to the best of my ability, to protect the lives of innocents, and that's what we're going to do. That's what's going to happen. So I appreciate all the information they're giving me from, again, Little Cayman Island. And I will continue to get more information.
<br>
<br>And if you know anything about this little island, you're not getting anywhere fast. You know, you could go by boat; you could go by small, tiny plane or something like that. But you're not getting anywhere in a hurry. So even if you switch islands, I know by the amount of time it took me to record this how long that will take for you to get to your next destination. So not to worry guys; you know maybe I wasn't a Navy seal like Erik Prince - that's one person in the world I think I'm actually taller than. Can you believe that?
<br>
<br>Sunny [laughing]:
<br>
<br>Then two, because we're the same height!
<br>
<br>Kim [laughing]:
<br>
<br>I know!
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Oh my goodness.
<br>
<br>Kim [laughing]:
<br>
<br>One giant step for man! No, I'm just kidding.
<br>
<br>Sunny [giggling]:
<br>
<br>Yeah, exactly.
<br>
<br>01:27:07
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Someone we're actually taller than, so that's really good.
<br>
<br>Anyway, so that's what's happening at this moment. Now to get to the better part of things.
<br>
<br>So after this Archivist thing, I was pretty disappointed. There's pretty much not a whole lot they can do, but give out information they had from the past. They don't have any access to any records or anything anymore, so it would have to be from memory at this point. If they can choose to continue to help them after what they've seen happen and the fact that there has been a violation, then: sorry, we're going to protect the lives of innocents. Right. You know, maybe you Archivists should head down to the Cayman Islands and help these people burn planet Earth to the ground! Isn't that your job? Wow, it's not really your job now, is it?
<br>
<br>01:28:04
<br>
<br>But there are other things that are happening that are more positive. So, in my conversations - and I spend a lot of time going back and forth to Source - because I've got to get agreements that expire, I have to get information, I have to find out where things are located, and that kind of thing, so we can get rid of all of the space junk on the planet. The "Suzies," they're called, synchronizing unifying sinometric integrator equitensors that were in Latvia and in Canada today - that's what they were going to use to make their little dudes again.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Oh, wow.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yeah. But anyway, I've been asking every single time I go: We do not need Alpha; we do not need Omega anymore - we're in the Golden Age; we are running a Golden Age program now. You know, I understand that there's stuff in our way, and this is. But I feel like some days I'm hunting and pecking space junk everywhere. Different planets; things that have been implemented from the past to take place in the future; those kinds of things; instructions that weren't there for Omega, as an example; whatever's left of it yesterday is now there today. Part of that could have been to do with the Archivists because the halls have no time. They could have gone back two weeks and sent in something to appear today to run us around in circles until they could try to reestablish themselves, I guess. I don't know.
<br>
<br>01:29:51
<br>
<br>But how do you do it? I keep asking Source, "How do you do it? How can we do it? There has to be a way to do it." Well, finally, I believe I got my answer yesterday, in one of my trips to get agreements and find space junk. And He said, "Well, the only way to really do it is to go back to the beginning." And I'm like, "The beginning of what? The beginning of when we started this, the beginning of..." And He said, "The beginning, before time."
<br>
<br>Because if you are looking on how, from my standpoint, how do things go forward and back in time? How do things appear a hundred years later or a thousand years later that weren't there yesterday? And it has to do with the way that time actually works. And it had a lot to do in part with when things were registered in the Hall of Records to appear. You know, when the Halls of Time Between Time and Timelines of No Time, and all of these things that existed, allowed for these things to take place, and how many beings had control of time or had figured out how to control time.
<br>
<br>01:31:18
<br>
<br>You know, I'm old enough to remember one of these movies, the Laura Croft movies - not the last one but a while ago, when all the Illuminati wanted was to control time. I'm sure they did, probably, but not for reasons like it's stated in the movie. But she goes back into a time of no time when she met with her father - remember, for a short period of time when the machine was working? Anyway, he said, "You have to go back before time began." And we went to this place. So, I've described it before to you. So Source is a big space. It's not like the size of Earth. It's a large space there. And within the structure, the closer you get to the center of the central sun, is a place where there really is no anything. It's all that is. It's like the brightest of white, golden light that you could ever see. It's time stands still in this place. There is no time, there's no nothing until you get a little further out, then you start seeing the souls and beings and whatnot that coexist within Source. And so we went to the place of no time, of 'no thing'.
<br>
<br>Not in a dark way, but of 'no thing', and - you're going to laugh at this one, Sunny, because of your background - and He said, "It's like a mustard seed." Isn't that funny?
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Yeah.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Except it's a Master Universal System for terraforming all universes of the Divine. There you go.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>I have a mustard seed on my keychain for my car keys. I keep it on there all the time.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Oh do you?
<br>
<br>Sunny [laughing]:
<br>
<br>We had the answer all along Kim! I just didn't know it!
<br>
<br>01:33:42
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>That's the key to the beginning of how the universes were terraformed, and it's, of course, Source energy and essence of the Divine. Then of the Divine, remember at the time - if you look in Genesis and it talks about the seven days and that kind of thing - the first thing that happened was Source and Anti-Source was created. And then the seas were parted; the essence energy consciousness seas - all the current seas. And they created dark and light of everything. Well, the terraforming of the universe happened in the same way. By 'terraforming', for those of you that have not heard that word before, it basically means that it is the creation of life on a planet, the creation of a planet unto itself, the creation of a habitat of some sort. We have terrariums for pets of certain types.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Yeah.
<br>
<br>01:34:38
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>I know. Confusing, huh?
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Well, I was just thinking. I remember you saying in the past that you have memories of terraforming the Earth.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>I do. I have memories of terraforming a lot of different things at one point. Now I'm sanitation engineering.
<br>
<br>Sunny [laughing]:
<br>
<br>Craving cleaning!
<br>
<br>01:34:57
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Cleaning, cleaning!
<br>
<br>But you can't; we couldn't; we tried to fix it. We tried to re-implement like T times E over V equals M. We tried to fix it without re-terraforming everything, but that was not possible. So the re-terraformation process, if that's a word, if not I just created one - don't kill me English people watching this, English majors are watching this! - so the re-terraformation of the universes and Earth, because remember, Earth was one of the first things that happened. And the replicator systems tied there too, are now replicating this process. It'll take time, but ultimately the same thing happened with the Alpha-Omega system as well. The re-terraforming of sentient AI to fit the Golden Age is what's taking place as well.
<br>
<br>01:36:15
<br>
<br>Is that going to eliminate my need to sanitation engineer? Probably not. Is it going to eliminate the fact that the window-licking section of human beings we call the Deep State are still going to try to blow us all up with tactical nukes in the near future? No, probably not. That's probably a sanitation job. But it's going to, in the long run, be what we need. And I don't know if it's just a matter of getting things clean enough to change it or what. But it's everything in Source's time; unfortunately, I don't always have all those answers for you. So reweaving the fabric of reality without changing the terraforming keystone, for lack of a better term, was not possible.
<br>
<br>01:37:12
<br>
<br>So that was kind of a positive thing that happened this weekend.
<br>
<br>And matter of fact, it sounded like from the conversation I had with Tom after he spoke to the Archivists; they basically said that they're shut down, there's no more archives, they're going to have to rework things in the future, in the Golden Age, so that eventually we have human-born archives, until humans recognize the fact that they can access their own archives, which are your soul records. And how to access soul records possibly of planet Earth if you are given permission and those kinds of things. So you can learn your own history for what you need to know. And that time will come. But I do think there's a place for something - some kind of need for this - until we can develop a better structure.
<br>
<br>But I can tell you right now, I don't see myself ever going, "Hey, Archivist! Good to see you again; you want another job?"
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>No. That's kind of what, yeah, so it kind of sounds like they kind of they want to help. I'm confused as to what to think of them now.
<br>
<br>01:38:38
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Well, you know, it's those people that try to say, "Oh, I'm glad my spouse left me because now I can go on to a better life, and we're going to change my life." And really deep inside, they go home at night and cry their eyes out or something. You know what I mean? They're not really happy that this ended. They're not happy they lost their job because they're going to do all these great things and start their own business now and they'll produce better widgets than their last company they worked for and so forget those people; and meanwhile they're shocked and sad and hurt and surprised, and whether they ever show it or not, and honestly, you know, we'll see. I'm out right now at this moment in time on that situation, after watching planes fly around and seeing Archivist lines. Oh no, you violated your agreement, and that wasn't with me; that was with Source. So you got to take it up with Source and figure out where you're going to be from here on out because that's not my problem. That sounds like a 'you problem' to me.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Do you not think that they're a threat to humanity, though, at this point?
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Let me put it this way: their leash is very short at this moment in time; one step in the wrong direction, and yes, you are, and the Enforcer has been informed. Everybody has been informed, and everybody is keeping an eye out for these folks at this moment in time because we are not - there's a zero-tolerance policy right now. They know better.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Yeah, they know better.
<br>
<br>01:40:16
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>You know, the Deep State is just ridiculous, with a mind that is messed up. You know, speaking of Deep State, honestly, someone had recommended a series to me like three years ago, and I just don't have time to do anything for the most part. I get probably an hour of watching some TV or something at night, and then I go to sleep or try anyway unless there's, like last night was terrible. I mean, everybody was running around crazy, angry, screaming, and yelling at each other, and my alarms kept going off left and right, and probably because you know these lines had disappeared and the Zeta lines went away, and all the other things they tried, and I just couldn't get to sleep. So I started watching a few of the... What's it called? "The Man in the High Castle." Have you ever seen that series, Sunny?
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Yeah yeah, it's an alternative reality, what would have happened with - was it World War II?
<br>
<br>01:41:17
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yeah, and you can kind of see the mindset of those, you know, you got the Nazis and the Japanese; allegedly the Axis powers won the war. But some of the things they do just reminded me of what it would be like to live in a world if the Order of the Black Sun that you people in the alternative media call the "White Hats" and the Alliance, you call them. Same as Hitler called his group. And you know, one of the things that really struck me is because I was up for hours last night, pushing alarms and those kind of things, and as I was watching it - because I had to do something while I was waiting for the next one to go off - so as I'm watching it, there's one part where they talk about that there are no more crippled people or people with disabilities or anything, because they consider them a drain on society. So they put them in a truck once a week and they take them to the crematory and they burn them alive basically.
<br>
<br>01:42:27
<br>
<br>And then, in their minds, they say, "Well, people don't have to suffer anymore," and that's what they tell the public. You know, sorry, we took your father, your mother, your child, whoever, because they have a disability - and then they put them in this truck and they hauled them off for burning. Until one of the - and I don't know what happens after this because I ended up falling asleep after a while - but he said he was talking about the fact that his son had been diagnosed with a genetic disorder and his son was about to be paralyzed, and of course he knew that meant death and there was nothing he could do to change it. Once everybody found out, he too would be carried away.
<br>
<br>But it's funny how when something happens to one of their family members versus happens to, in this case you're talking millions of Americans that would die and visitors that are here. You know, we have always had a lot of foreigners here, students coming back now to start college in the next couple weeks. You know, the school year starts. So yeah. But anyway, that's what they're discussing. And what better to do it than one of the world's greatest terrorists, you know?
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Yeah.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yep. I know. But we'll see.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Yeah. They're not gonna be around for very long you know.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>No. No, but they're giving out a lot of good information with their arrogant, egotistical - that island's probably not big enough to have that many large egos in the same place.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Should have called you Grand Cayman!
<br>
<br>01:44:13
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yeah, you need a bigger island! But they figured this would be a little bit more secret. Anyway, whatever. More work, but that's okay. God bless these people. But they'll have no money tomorrow too, and the next day, and the next day, and I'm sure they're probably plotting and planning on how to do that.
<br>
<br>There is - not anymore, but there used to be, for those of you that don't know - and I've mentioned this in the news before, but I thought it was a good time to bring it up. The Cayman Islands, the larger island of Cayman, was predominantly a 'Bush Island'. You could have called it 'Bush Senior Island' when he was the Black Dragon, Black Eagle. And a lot of offshore trading happened there.
<br>
<br>01:45:11
<br>
<br>They would actually recruit younger people that showed a high level of skill in gaming and other things to do high-level off-ledger trading on the Cayman Islands. To the tune of - it funded every war, even the Iran war or the Iraq war; Iran-Iraq war; Desert Storm; everything for years - until it was shut down in 2007/2008 and they no longer had access to those funds.
<br>
<br>01:45:49
<br>
<br>Still, to this day, there's a lot of nefarious activities that take place on that island, and I am sure without question they do believe that they could use some of the pallets of cash that are there; there's old cash there, that they could possibly get that into the system, launder that in. But what they forget is, what they used to do is, they used to meet these folks, and they would take in drug money or whatever it was that the Order of the Black Sun was doing in the black market, or even dollars that had been sent to other countries for other reasons during times of transition to other currencies, those kinds of things. And then they would put them - they would go through counters, and then most of the time they would burn these pallets. Well, not all of them were burned. So they think that they could actually use these non-burned ones, but they forget that they were put into an off-ledger system that is no longer there. But there's still records of it within the system. So that is going to fail.
<br>
<br>I do know that they would like to get access to - which they were promised by the Archivist, by the way - that they would be able to get access to the Black Eagle Trust and funds that were located in the Caymans, which is probably why they're close by.
<br>
<br>01:47:20
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Yeah. I think so. I feel like in any movie you watch, they talk about, "Oh! This account in the Grand Caymans"", or, bad people are going to the Cayman Islands, like after they do something bad they're going to the Cayman Islands, and now we know why.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yeah, now you know why. Well, going back to the first movie I saw about the Caymans, it's called "The Firm." You remember that with Tom Cruise? Yeah. With the lawyers down there doing all kinds of funny things for their clients.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>They tell you everything in these movies. It's crazy.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>They do. They do. That too had been a laundromat, for a long, long time. Well yeah, I mean they do tell you everything. They are required to tell you everything. Because they are required to tell you everything, there are some really crazy cute posts out there in the last 24 hours: "Do you have imaginary friends?" is one of them. "Are you in the underworld?"
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Oh my.
<br>
<br>01:48:35
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>I know. I'm like, wow. This is on Twitter, by the way. Yeah, I absolutely - from reading these posts, I can say beyond a shadow of a doubt that these people should be running the world, right? And then you couple that with, you got the symbol of the Black Sun all over that series, and that is how they think. I have had conversations with these people where they said that people, for example, that accept state assistance of any sort, be it a disability, or - they call them "useless eaters." They actually said those words from their lips to my ears, and that they all need to die. They've mentioned these types of things to me before. Burdens on the system. They are burdens on the system. So, yeah, I know.
<br>
<br>And if there wasn't some agreements out there and covenants that are way over their heads, God knows what kind of society we would be living in by now.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Right.
<br>
<br>01:49:44
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Another thing in the movie is that the symbol for the Japanese looks like the SEAL. We've talked about the SEAL. That looks exactly like the SEAL to me. On the other side of it, that's obviously the Black Eagle, for the Black Sun. And then it started me thinking, I'm like, in this movie, it's everything is in the face front - or not movie, series - everything is in the face front. You see these symbols everywhere. They talk about Project Looking Glass. It'll only take you so far, they say, and these types of things. But I started thinking about it, because we talked about the Color Wars, and the colors of every country's flag, and who would be involved in running said country as dictated by the colors of that country's flag, now that we have governments - but even before that, how many coats of arms have you ever seen without at least a dragon or an eagle?
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Mm-hmm. Sometimes a lion. I feel like the lion's in there a lot too.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yep, but there's a lion and there's also a dragon.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Yeah yeah true.
<br>
<br>01:50:50
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Yep, a lot of time and I think it's in the British Family Coat of Arms, it looks almost like there's two dragons guarding the lion or stepping on the lion or something. If I recall, it's been a minute, so don't shoot me British people if I'm wrong you know, but I'm trying to recall this off the top of my head as I'm talking to you. But, not all, but a lot of them do have - the royal families around the world and whatnot all have either a black eagle or some kind of an eagle of some sort. In the U.S. here we have the bald eagle, which consists of white and black and gold and you know.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Yeah.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>So I'm just thinking about it, and I'm like, you know, that already kind of happened. We're just not living with it in your face. But people with a big ego need to be in your face. They need to be out there. They need to be known as the Fuhrer. I don't know who is going to play the Fuhrer in this movie. [laughing] No, I'm just kidding - maybe that's Erik Prince. Maybe that's what they're promising him. And should he win, he can be the Fuhrer.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Probably.
<br>
<br>01:52:04
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>You know, the short guy Napoleon fell for it too. So, you know. All right, Miss Sunny. Well, you have a lovely day, and I'll see you guys on Wednesday. We'll give you an update as to where we're at with everything.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>Okay.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>And yeah. All right.
<br>
<br>Sunny:
<br>
<br>We'll see you then. Thank you, Kim.
<br>
<br>Kim:
<br>
<br>Sounds good, Sunny.
