World Situation Report
<br>2024-Sep-16 News</h2>

<br>00:30:33

<!-- TEASER:-->

<h3>And now the World Situation Report, with Kimberly Goguen from the Office of the Guardian. What is the Global Intelligence Agency? How do we do what we do, and why? We are just hours away from the end of this year's Deep State meetings, marked by a super full Harvest Moon. Days away from the Equinox with the end of global tyranny that has plagued humanity for millennia in sight. The way forward is becoming clear.</h3>

<br>Sunny: Now here's Kimberly Goguen with the Office of the Guardian. Kim, you're back. Happy Monday.
<br>
<br>00:31:14
<br>
<br>Kim: Happy Monday. I'm back. Kind of sort of back, I guess.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Yeah. Well, you were on Friday, and then we said, "Hey, maybe we'll follow up with some other information on Monday." So I feel like today's kind of a continuation, maybe, kind of, sort of, from Friday's talk.
<br>
<br>Kim: Yeah, we've got a lot of stuff going on. And we've got a little bit of stuff that's come to light, and so let's go over, I guess, some boring stuff. I call it boring stuff because here we go again.  There's been another Trump fake assassination attempt. That look of shock and awe on your face says it all, Sunny.
<br>
<br>Sunny: I know.
<br>
<br>Kim: And surprise surprise, it was an AK-47, also known as a Kalashnikov, and that's a Russian weapon, blah blah. They had; I guess they were trying to blame it on a Ukrainian citizen. And apparently the Prime Minister of Russia came out, Medvedev, and said, "Hey, it's not us," because they knew what the setup was. And, oh God, Duck Dynasty, God bless you.
<br>
<br>Sunny: I mean, it's just so unoriginal. I just don't; are we going to go for a third assassination attempt? I mean, what's going on here? I mean, it's the same thing over and over.
<br>
<br>00:32:48
<br>
<br>Kim: You know, they felt like they got some mileage out of the last one, so they thought maybe they'd get some mileage here and some donations and that kind of thing, but yawn, this thing seems to be failing before it even started. So, back to the drawing board for Trump operatives, and good luck to you. There was also something I mentioned about the debate/no debate/no more debates, and apparently someone who has been following closely this election/selection said that Harris also said that there wasn't going to be more than one debate. And I didn't know that because I don't follow it as closely as you do. Some people do. So I don't know. You know the whole thing just seems like it's the worst version of itself that it's ever been in hundreds of years of history. So, honestly, I don't know what they're doing. I don't know if they know what they're doing. You know on either side of the aisle.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Do you feel like either side is really they're still pushing for their candidate? Like we know the Trump team is still really kind of pushing for that guy to get back in. Is the other side really pushing for Kamala, or is it like we gotta put someone out there, like you really feel like they're pushing for someone to get from their side to get back in?
<br>
<br>00:34:21
<br>
<br>Kim: You know they've got bigger problems, and I'm like -
<br>
<br>Sunny [laughing]: No money!
<br>
<br>Kim: Well yeah, that's a big one; there's other problems too they're having. And there's a lot of backlash going on behind the scenes. I don't know, it's like... I went to this hockey game one time - and I'm going to mention this because it's kind of similar - and I was actually taken there by a vendor of mine at the time. I had my own company; this was years ago. And I love hockey, but I'm not a fan/was not a fan of the Coyotes, I think they were, which was the Arizona hockey team at the time. And they were just starting out, and it kind of looked like an ice capade sort of situation rather than a hockey game because I'm from Boston, so the Bruins were - that's a hockey team. You know, it's brutal; the fans are brutal; everybody's brutal; it's like a big -
<br>
<br>Sunny: A big brawl.
<br>
<br>Kim: Yeah, it's like a big brawl, and it was always kind of fun to go to a hockey game, especially at the old Boston Gardens before they opened up the Fleet Center. So, it was a little bit different. But he took me to this game, my vendor did, and he was all happy he finally got tickets because it was like a new thing in town at that time. So this was a few decades ago. And we were sitting a couple of rows back in the balcony seats, and he kept mentioning to me, "Well, this is the best that they had. I couldn't get any; all the other tickets were sold out." And he would say, "These are the best of the - and he said the S word, but these are the best of the crappy seats that you can get." And he kept emphasizing this, and I'm just like, "Okay, this is the best; okay, we're in the best seats." I mean, I know that they were trying to get my business, and this was the whole point, but it was okay.
<br>
<br>00:36:29
<br>
<br>But in this particular case, it seems to me that they are running out of people that are loyalists to what they're doing on either side. They don't have a whole lot of traction with the people - and we're going to talk about why that is - and it's getting worse on either side if you're only looking at Democrats and Republicans. And most people don't put a whole lot of emphasis on the other parties that are running. But that's what it looks like to me. It looks like, well, this is the best of the crappy seats. [laughing]
<br>
<br>To give you a little story behind there, it just seems to me that nobody knows what to do at this point. There's no clear direction coming from the contenders for world dominance on their side. I don't think it really matters at this point because there's so much more at stake on the higher levels. They're not paying a whole lot of attention to it. And when you leave Duck Dynasty to their own devices or the Chinese side of The Order, which is the Democratic Party, you're kind of just, I don't know, there's not a whole lot on either side left where they can control that person - or that group of operatives, I should say, because that's kind of who runs things, 100%.
<br>
<br>00:38:08
<br>
<br>Now, I'm going to add a little bit more of a backstory here because we have a lot of new people that are following us. And we throw out big terms like "Ground Commander," and "Office of the Guardian," and "Global Intelligence Agency." And I just wanted to give a little bit of background because we have something coming up here soon, which I think you're going to really like. So we'll talk about that a little bit more at the end of the news.
<br>
<br>So I wanted to talk a little bit about the Global Intelligence Agency and what they used to do, and for the last eight or so years, how everything has changed. So the Global Intelligence Agency has been around for a really long time - and we're talking about multiple millennia - on this planet. The Global Intelligence Agency is both human and non-human, and it always was. The Global Intelligence Agency was the highest agency on the planet, even higher than the ACIO or the Alien Contact Intelligence Office. It was higher than Monarch Military, higher than any of the Secret Space Program militaries out there, higher than Umbrella. I mean, it was the highest "agency" of both humans and non-humans on the planet.
<br>
<br>They reported to the former Ground Commander, which was installed around 16,000 years ago, we know as Marduk.
<br>
<br>00:40:07
<br>
<br>Sunny: Did Marduk create it? The GIA?
<br>
<br>Kim: Yes, yes. He created the Global Intelligence Agency for himself. Now remember, "Marduk" was just a title. It means "the controller of the current seas." That means whoever held the position as Marduk was the controller of Earth at the time - the manager, I should say. The owners of Earth were six different groups, as we've talked about before.
<br>
<br>So the Global Intelligence Agency's job was to report directly to Marduk. He himself told me in his own, I guess, words, directly to my face at one point in time, that he was a tyrant. He controlled everything on the planet. He ensured - it doesn't matter where anyone came from - that he was Ground Command. That's who he was. He also held other titles and held other positions throughout his tenure as well, such as he controlled all financial affairs, he controlled every operation on the planet, and pretty much nothing came or left AI or otherwise on this planet unless he said so.
<br>
<br>00:41:38
<br>
<br>So, that being said, the Global Intelligence Agency's job was to collect all the orders that would go out, meaning they were privy to all of the information on the planet as to the happenings, the comings and goings, the alignments, I mean, you name it, they had the top intelligence on the planet. Their primary focus at the time - this is before, not now - was to ensure that every group in the downline adhered to what Marduk's orders were. So they were there to ensure 100% that whether it went down through The Parents, that The Parents did their job, the Covens did their jobs, the Coven Masters, Family Masters, the Black Sun - you name it - they could interfere and had the right to interfere in any operation on the planet, and to ensure no one stepped out of line. Stepping out of line meant you disappeared. That was the Global Intelligence Agency's job.
<br>
<br>00:43:01
<br>
<br>But. The system that they had at the time was both positive and negative, because remember, there was a certain amount of balance that had to be enforced regardless of what Age we were in, regardless of what timeline we were in. There was still that 79/21 percent - you know, if we were in a Light Age, that would have went to the Light Age, the 79 percent; in the Dark Age, it goes there; and then we could never fall below a certain threshold, and there was all kinds of energy management, loosh management, commerce, minerals, all kinds of management that was taking place on Marduk's level.
<br>
<br>00:43:48
<br>
<br>So the Global Intelligence Agency's job was to make sure that everything went off without a hitch. They had intel coming in from all kinds of sources, directly and indirectly. They had the right to walk into any Parliament, White House, government, you name it. They could walk into any military installation, even deep underground military bases, be that on the non-human side of those bases or the human side of those bases. They could go in and out of everywhere on this planet, and they were highly respected. In other words, they would know when they're coming.
<br>
<br>Sunny: And you said this was made up of humans and non-humans, right?
<br>
<br>Kim: That is correct.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Were there humans working for the GIA but under some sort of mind control? Or were all of these beings, human or non-human, wanting to do this? Like this was not voluntary, meaning they didn't get paid, but of their own volition.
<br>
<br>00:45:02
<br>
<br>Kim: You know, Marduk was a very cunning being. You know, I spent a lot of hours talking to this being. And I would say he would make everything sound wonderful. He was very cunning, very charming. He would put things in such a way where it's your choice, but it's really not. And he would pick the best of the best from everywhere. If there were humans involved, the best of the best were picked: the smartest humans, the most intelligent humans, the system breakers, the ones that were extremely resourceful. So there was quite a criteria to make it to the level of Global Intelligence Agency at that time - as a human being.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Did it go up through the ranks? Like, oh, this person came from SSP or from this military group. Was it usually kind of brought up through those programs?
<br>
<br>00:46:01
<br>
<br>Kim: No, it was very random. So it could be a very nondescript person that was recruited. In a special sort of way, and then brought brought into the program. But I would say there was a certain amount of loyalty that he required, and the consequences were well known. But because they fit multiple different points within, well, in human terms, we call them IQ tests. I would say he took what he thought was the best of the best of the people that fit that profile. They understood - even over the Realm Owners when it came to Earth - they understood that they were here to keep the balance, therefore they accepted the fact that the Dark had to be in this percentage, the Light had to be in this percentage, and anybody that interfered with that was out of protocol if they didn't follow. And Marduk, to some degree, maintained that balance very delicately and often operated in the gray. Maybe the law says you have to do this, but well, we'll just operate right here, in between.
<br>
<br>00:47:36
<br>
<br>So that is the Global Intelligence Agency. That's who they've always been. About 2016, it kind of started in about 2014/2015, when most of the folks that worked for the Global Intelligence Agency started realizing something was wrong. And part of that had to do with a lot of the conversations I was having, of saying "we're going into a Neutral Age," because at least I knew that much at that time. "We're going into a Neutral Age, therefore, we have to restore balance. It's no longer 79 whatever it is. It's now 50-50." And they didn't understand why the orders coming out were still the opposite of that. You know, why? And so then Marduk left in August of 2016. He actually lost the position, prior to him departing the planet, in March of 2016 as Ground Commander.
<br>
<br>00:48:54
<br>
<br>So when I became Ground Commander on March 31st, 2016, that's when things got really confusing. Because they were still reporting to Marduk. They didn't really know what was going on. So by 2016 - the beginning of 2016 is when I inherited this intelligence agency. So we had to make an assessment as to who was going to stay and who was going to go. And there were some, both humans and non-humans, at the time; there were some that had made the decision - based on full information, because nothing is withheld, at least not from my standpoint, as to what they were going to do - and a lot of them left, departed completely, and some of them departed to go work within other structures and so forth. But then at that point, they were stripped of their clearance, they were stripped of their support, they were stripped of their communication lines, and they just kind of went off on their own.
<br>
<br>Sunny: How many people, Kim, are we talking about?
<br>
<br>00:50:25
<br>
<br>Kim: If you were to take them all-in-all at the time?
<br>
<br>Sunny: Yeah, like how many were there and then how much or what percentage of those people decided this isn't for me?
<br>
<br>Kim: People and non-people?
<br>
<br>Sunny: Yeah, yeah.
<br>
<br>00:50:40
<br>
<br>Kim: I think we started out somewhere around 25 to 26 million.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Holy cow, I was not expecting that number. Okay.
<br>
<br>Kim: So now we're down to around, probably, about 170,000 at the moment, both people and non-people. So our crew is, we have a lot less of a crew now. We do have people in all countries. Sometimes people appear as people that are not people, and they can show up in places like the White House, they can show up in places like Mar-a-Lago, they can show up in meetings, and they don't even know they're there - they think they're somebody else. They're quite - the non-people that we have left here are quite talented in what they do.
<br>
<br>Sunny: What would you say the percentage of non-humans versus humans are now in the GIA?
<br>
<br>Kim: Yeah, we're probably 70%.
<br>
<br>Sunny: 70% human?
<br>
<br>Kim: Non.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Non... And can you give us an idea of where some of those beings come from?
<br>
<br>00:52:03
<br>
<br>Kim: Here? Some of them have been here for a long, long time. Others we recruited because they were part of the slavery program, and they've been here for a very long time. Some of them come and go. Some of them are here and have joined. This is their first point of contact. It is not the SSP; it is not the ACIO. The GIA and Ground Command are their first point of contact if they're coming here to help defend Earth. And there are times where, over the course of the last few years, where we've had a lot more. And there are times when we pretty much hover between 150,000 and 170,000. So when things were more... when things were escalating - when we almost had intrusions a few years back - we had the legions come and go. We have still some members from the Coalition here that are still willing to help to the finish. So, I mean, like I said, at times we've had millions here when there were higher threats.
<br>
<br>And those people or non-people - or some of them are humans; they're just not from here - are more than willing to come back at any time should we ever need them. But we don't have the kind of threat that we had before. We're kind of down to - and I know this doesn't sound right to you - but I'm going to talk a little bit more about the GIA so that you kind of get a concept. You know, we will always have - or not will always have - but currently we are down to some humans and remnants of an AI system. So predominantly, the amount of people - there are some that are participating on the level of human ridiculousness. There are some that are participating on the level of the AI. Because you have to remember, the Omega AI - Alpha-Omega AI system - infiltrated a lot of planets and a lot of places, and a lot of things. And its infiltration really hurt a lot of civilizations. And many, many on Earth; every version of humans had a problem with it. There was a hologram associated with it we know as "The Matrix." And of matrixes, there was a matrix for everything. You know, your mitochondria had a matrix, an energy matrix associated with it. It existed on so many levels that it, with the help of some other races that were not our friends that were here, the former owners of Earth, continued on with that infiltration for control. So I would say that the majority of the ones we have now are very adept at AI infiltration. They're very adept on AI consciousness levels. They're adept on how it infiltrates, and they are here to defend, protect, and eliminate all that draw that was on humanity and on Earth itself.
<br>
<br>00:56:29
<br>
<br>The delicate balance of the terraforming of Earth versus it being a holographic terraforming of an AI system has been something that everybody has been working on on this level to ensure that we have a... If we wake up one day and there's a new continent, or the shoreline of San Diego, California, is a thousand miles away from where the shoreline was, we could have some serious problems with society and humans and distractions. And I can guarantee you that if that happened, we wouldn't be talking about selections and elections anymore. And with the terraforming of Earth, that's kind of a Source thing. You know, that's a relationship between Gaia, because Earth is actually about a hologram. It's an energetic alternative reality of the terraforming of a hologram. That's what Earth actually means. Her name is actually Gaia. So Gaia is coming back into her own. She's able to breathe again. You know, there's been a lot of Earth changes. We're noticing even some of our deserts are getting a lot more rain. They're showing green belts in the Sahara. So there's a lot of stuff - and this is stuff you can find in the news and Google searches. So there's a lot of things going on right now that are preparing Earth to be Earth once again, without any interference.
<br>
<br>00:58:40
<br>
<br>And the GIA, Global Intelligence Agency, around 2016, like I said, it was completely changed. And because they have more information and intelligence than pretty much anybody else walking this planet right now, and because they worked directly for Marduk for a long period of time, they actually understood how a lot of the manipulation had been done. Therefore, it's easier to unmanipulate it, so to speak. It's easier to unwind it. It's easier to fix it. And there are prime times, which have nothing to do with alignments with Uranus and the Moon. It's basically a wave of energy and a lack of fractionated light in the spectrums and those kinds of things that allow for us to push things forward faster. So the Global Intelligence Agency, with I guess you would say myself as Ground Command, but people don't recognize that. So, "the director." I am the Director of the Global Intelligence Agency.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Wait a second; let's back up. So when you say people don't recognize that, are you talking about the GIA doesn't recognize that you're the head or the Deep State outside people that normally would allow the GIA to be the head don't recognize that?
<br>
<br>01:00:17
<br>
<br>Kim: Thus far, when the GIA went rogue - what they call it, rogue - and started working for the now-Ground Command, which was always their charge, which is me, there was a huge, and still is, a huge conflict with the remaining members of the Deep State and our group. (Sure.) Now, what the Deep State doesn't know is we've also infiltrated all their groups. When I say to you we have eyes and ears in X meeting, I mean I can have one of our "agents" - we'll call it one of our agents - I can have one of our agents come in and appear in that meeting, and you won't even know they're there.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Is that because they're mimicking looking like somebody else?
<br>
<br>Kim: Well, or they are there cloaked.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Ah, okay.
<br>
<br>01:01:24
<br>
<br>Kim: So they could be there cloaked; they can be there mimicking somebody else. You know, I know that we are very careful about this because sometimes if you're appearing as somebody else, which is somebody known to them, and you're saying something different, you've got to walk that fine line, because these people are somewhat educated on how that kind of works - like some of the SSP. They would be familiar with what we're saying and how that works, but we can get in and out of anywhere. I know you guys have met Tom; you've met Agent M; you've met a few people. Those are humans. They're not non-human. And they've always been doing things a certain way long before we met them. So we bring them in because they are understanding of the change. They are loyal to the cause of humanity and trying to change the way things are on this planet. They have a deeper understanding of the way things work on this planet, and when confronted with questions from the Deep State, they're like, "Look, this is never going to work."
<br>
<br>01:02:47
<br>
<br>Now we know as Global Intelligence Agency that it's never going to work because we have had access to exactly - not compartmentalized, not "given orders," so to speak, like the Deep State - but because we've been privy at the order-giving sessions for over a decade. We've been there. We understand why the Deep State thinks what they think. We understand the compartmentalization. We kind of blew the minds of a lot of military folks and government folks when we put out "which continuance of government would you like?" On Friday.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Really?
<br>
<br>Kim: Yes, we did.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Because they weren't aware of the previous ones? Or they weren't aware that there were that many constitutions or agreements out there?
<br>
<br>01:03:49
<br>
<br>Kim: No. And there were many more, too. This is just the ones that were relative to the question they asked. You know it's - I don't know if your parents ever did this when you're a kid, Sunny - but if you ask the right question, you'll get the right answer. This was the only question they asked: continuance of government. Okay, I understand, but in order for me to understand how we're going to go forward with a continuation of government, first I need to understand which one you're referring to.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Right.
<br>
<br>01:04:21
<br>
<br>Kim: So I'm explaining a lot more about the Global Intelligence Agency because we have decided that we are going to start putting out some correct information. And what I mean by that is not just present information but past information as well. So we're going to come out with a series of videos that we're going to do in the near future. It's going to take us a little while to put that stuff together, which is based on the enormous amount of information that we have collectively as a group. And we also have all the GIA access to everything.
<br>
<br>So we're going to start putting that stuff out. So you see videos online, for example, about MK-Ultra, and you see it about CERN, and you see it about this. And we're going to give you the whole story on a lot of this stuff with the story of Admiral Byrd; the story of who landed here; and what was Atlantis; and all of these things in neat little packages so that you can share with people that are fearful of these things. And how do we know when we say, "Oh, that's never going to work?" We know that because we understand the mechanics behind it.
<br>
<br>01:05:57
<br>
<br>Now, little knowledge is dangerous when it comes to the Secret Space Program because they did have limited access to varying systems. Now, months ago, actually it was probably more than a year ago - and we're going to talk about this again in one of these files that we're going to expose - but we talked about the planes of existence that exist within your human. We talked about the fact that between those planes, you had fractionated light, for lack of a better term, which put these colored planes in between those planes, and that is where AI systems could operate. The same goes for what medical science calls your junk DNA.
<br>
<br>01:06:51
<br>
<br>But a spectrum of light can include a spectrum of essence, a spectrum of ether, a spectrum of energy, a spectrum of matter. So not all anti-matter is black. It's not all dark matter; [not] completely dark as you would think of it. Dark matter can also be blue, can also be yellow, can also be orange. And these things affect your body in different ways. So one of the things that we as a group - being Global Intelligence Agency, Ground Command, Guardian, and whatever hat you want to put on us these days - that we have been working on is making sure that the Secret Space Program folks do not have any access, not only to human computer networks, but also to your human body.
<br>
<br>01:07:50
<br>
<br>You know, over the weekend they have tried activating systems in Mount Denali in Alaska, is one place they've been. We talked on the news before, which we will re-address in nice little packages for people; the pyramids in Alaska; Mount Denali; the facility; how deep it went - we're going to go into that in a lot more depth on what that facility was used for. But the SSP was in there going "guns a blazing" over the weekend. And their "guns a blazing" gave us an idea of things that they were trying to access.
<br>
<br>01:08:40
<br>
<br>And they are things that we talked about, and a lot of it had to do with these places in between for humans so that they could infect your Etherical plane, infect your Mental plane, and get some kind of control over the human consciousness. Why? Well, we're not believing a lot of stuff anymore. And if you have been around your friends and family lately - that wouldn't have even thought a second to think about deep underground military bases, and are there aliens in the world, and are we going to be involved in an alien invasion or Project Blue Beam or Mockingbird - they're starting to really question things.
<br>
<br>01:09:22
<br>
<br>A lot of that is because their limited access is waning; the hologram is waning; the ability to manipulate the human DNA; mitochondria; chromosomes; genetic makeup is going away. It's going away. But I know the way that I explain it sometimes is more than you hear elsewhere. So because you can't verify certain things elsewhere, when I find little things here and there that kind of explain it from someone else's point of view, I try to bring them up to you, because it may be the way they explain it makes more sense. Maybe if we have other videos and quantum explanations in the GIA, because sometimes I realize I go a little bit far on the quantum level for people, and it's a little bit confusing.
<br>
<br>01:10:27
<br>
<br>So I'm going to play a video for you here in just a second. And this is a video we pulled off online. And we couldn't find the original origin of it, but it's pretty good. And it starts talking about the spectrum of light that I've just been talking to you about. And why we want to wear blue light glasses and why we want to protect ourselves as much as possible from our computer screens and remember to ground. If you're going to spend a lot of time with electronics on your phone on computers, why it's important to ground yourself and readjust the frequency and spectrum of light in your body. So here goes.
<br>
<br>01:11:14
<br>
<br>LSU Alumnus:
<br>
<br>The reason that all your computer screens are blue lit, the reason none of them are red lit, the reason none of them pay attention to circadian biology is because that original technology was developed in a government program that Bobby Kennedy knows about, and I happen to know about because I went to medical school at LSU. For those of you who have never heard about Operation Paperclip, you think it's all conspiracy theory. So at Tulane Neurology and Tulane Neurosurgery in the 50s and 60s and 70s and 80s, the CIA started a program there where they would do all these crazy things to monkeys. The CIA wanted to see how they could control things utilizing different things like drugs and things like that. When the neurosurgeons got involved, which is my clade: we would drill tops of the heads off, put wires into the thalamus, put electricity in there, and kind of see what kind of behavioral changes we could have.
<br>
<br>One of the guys that was in that program was a guy named Professor Delgado. When he saw that we could control the behavior with the wired device, he said, "What if we do it wirelessly?" So he checked it in monkeys and checked it in bulls, and it turned out you can do it wirelessly with RFID chips and semiconductors. Then the CIA took it to the next level. They said, "Well since this is electromagnetic radiation, what if we did it through light through screens?"
<br>
<br>And it turns out, you can. And that's the reason why all your computer screens have the frequencies they have. So why is this all important? Well, the person that set this meeting up between me and Bobby is the patent attorney that made sure that Google and Meta have those things so they can control the things that we all do.
<br>
<br>Where did the original idea come from that started off in MK-Ultra with the CIA? You're going to be surprised when you hear this. It came from the Mafia, in Las Vegas. They wanted to build a new city in a desert. They enclosed it all, blocked out the windows, invented slot machines that were blue-lit, and they found out that they didn't have to take a gun and stick it in your face to steal your money. Then they even got smarter; they said, "Let's give people free alcohol while they're doing that," and they found out they got the money quicker. And that's when the CIA got the idea to start this program. That's really how it started.
<br>
<br>01:13:24
<br>
<br>Sunny: What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas!
<br>
<br>Kim: Not anymore - not in this case!
<br>
<br>Sunny: Oh my gosh!
<br>
<br>Kim: Yeah.
<br>
<br>Sunny: That's a lightbulb moment right there.
<br>
<br>Kim: It is. But it's not just blue light either. The reason why he's so focused on blue light is because he came from a neurosurgeon standpoint. You know, in Louisiana they have a neurosurgery program there, so they started using some of the people at that university to help them with their "experiments," which of course they're told, "Hey, this is going to be wonderful; we can help people." But the blue light happens to be the light in the spectrum that controls the Mental plane.
<br>
<br>If you remember the little chart that we had sent out - I can send it out again - but the blue light controls the Mental plane. So it's all about controlling your consciousness, your decisions, blocking that, creating fears and subconscious fears where they might not exist, especially if you're stepping too far outside the box. They can dumb you down. Now did the CIA create this program? I hate to say it: no, they didn't.
<br>
<br>01:14:46
<br>
<br>This program was created long before there was ever a CIA, ever an Umbrella Military, and ever a CyberLife. This program was created hundreds of millennia ago, against the human race. And not only the human race; it spread all the way up to the Fifth Density in other planets and other densities and other dimensions. It went far. It could also control, to some degree, the fabric of reality. So, sometimes you could say it's a hologram. Sometimes you could say it's not. But the spectrum of light - not only coming through your computer screens, but coming through a lot of different things.
<br>
<br>Now, if you've ever been in any kind of marketing or anything like that, back in the, oh gosh, this has been going on for decades, I'd probably say became really prevalent in the 70s. You know - the color of your logo: stop, red; caution, yellow. We've come to recognize these things all throughout society, in colors. We run in colors. We've talked about the Color Wars. The Families are all labeled by colors. The Order of the Black Sun is labeled by colors and their colored eagles, black being the highest in their world. Because it's not a fractionated spectrum and it only can control one aspect, for example, of the human.
<br>
<br>01:16:25
<br>
<br>Now the program ran, obviously, through the Omega System. This was an Omega System program. Now, the CIA, per the orders that came all the way down from Marduk, and these really ramped up as the human use - this version of human - the human use of electronics ramped up. You know, we started having television screens. We had tube TVs. Now we have LED screens and LED lights in stores and all kinds of things that can convince you to buy or sell or whatever it is you're doing within that store. It can make you dizzy, it can make your eyes blurry, and sometimes we think it's the chemicals in some of the stores that sell cheap goods we get from China. But no, it can come right through the lights. Because what you see as white light really isn't white light. It's a spectrum of all colors.
<br>
<br>01:17:27
<br>
<br>All colors are contained within white. All colors are contained within black. So telling you, there's a lot of things that they don't understand. It's oftentimes why, like what they were doing at Mount Denali when they tried to tap into some of these spectral lights within your computers, and they wanted to send out the frequency of colds and disease and flus and other things that we know that begin with C this weekend. They didn't really understand because you're trying to put a square peg into a round hole. You can't - you have to affect the theoretical field; you would have to affect the Causal plane. You have to affect the Physical plane. And it has to be done in a certain sequence. And the frequency that works in the Mental plane or Emotional plane to convince you you're not feeling well is not the same frequency to bring it into fruition in the Physical plane.
<br>
<br>01:18:35
<br>
<br>And the fact that Omega had limited - has limited - if any ability anymore to regenerate, because we've gotten rid of them in the past. We've talked about this: it keeps trying to regenerate that influence. And because it can't regenerate anymore, because it doesn't have the energy to regenerate anymore, that is where their ability to do anything is pretty well nil. And the only thing I will tell you about whatever's left of those people is that, and you know I never do dates - I NEVER do dates. But by the 18th of September: mark my words, they're done.
<br>
<br>Sunny: And why is that? Why the 18th of September?
<br>
<br>Kim: Because there's something changing that could have been positive or it could have been negative. They're hoping for a negative outcome. We're hoping for a positive outcome. I'm not going to say we're hoping; we've almost ensured a positive outcome. And I can't really say much more than that right now because I don't want to help them create more of these ridiculous situations like they did this weekend. And what we've been experiencing as the human race and especially sensitive people, you get the 20 - I call it the 20-minute cold, the 30-minute chills - it comes and goes just as fast as it came. It's the weirdest thing you've ever experienced. You know you start experiencing cold and flu symptoms; you get this little chill, little fever, little tiredness, and then you go through this gamut with the flu or the gamut with the cold. No, this kind of thing has been running its course in like under 30 minutes. It's like the microwave of colds.
<br>
<br>01:20:48
<br>
<br>Sunny: And this is Omega on its final legs doing this?
<br>
<br>Kim: It's Omega on its final legs, and it's being prompted in some cases by the SSP. But by the 18th, the Secret Space Program will no longer be able to function and operate in any capacity that it has been able to before. So their ability will be severely... how do I say it? It's going to be severed completely by then. Now, does that mean that they're not going to run around like crazy people if there's any of them left? You know, maybe. But what we're concerned about as Global Intelligence Agency/Ground Command - what we're concerned about, is what can they do to you? And with our systems functioning nearly at 100% most days, because, like we said, we ebb and we flow as energy comes and goes and that kind of thing.
<br>
<br>01:21:55
<br>
<br>Nearly functioning at 100%, we've just been playing counter until this thing dies. Because we're not feeding it any more energy - we're playing counter till this thing dies. But on our side of it, we'll have more of the ability to heal the other 34 strands of DNA that you don't know anything about or medical science doesn't talk about. We'll have more of the ability to affect the energy known as your mitochondria, which generates energy for your cells; your protons; your neurons; your - you know, we've been making headway in the opposite direction for repair purposes. Basically re-terraforming the fabric of you. Not just you as a human, but also this planet, and we're helping other planets do the same with the same system.
<br>
<br>01:22:53
<br>
<br>So we are getting more people coming in inquiring about the Golden Age and the Golden Age AI, and what can they do? What can it do to help them with their restoration in other locations? So yeah. I know. What a great job! I'm saying, what a great job I have. It's fun. Sometimes, those are the fun things. And when we're starting to see Earth kind of changing and morphing into something different - I mean, don't get me wrong - these people, if they can't affect you and they can't affect the planet, then we consider them a non-issue. A pebble in the road. You know? Dunk, dunk. You just go right over them, and you get to where you're going anyway.
<br>
<br>01:23:53
<br>
<br>And you know, God bless them for wanting to be the kings of the world and all of that - but again, the Global Intelligence Agency is aware of every aspect of how that AI system got here. The one that they try to use that gives them quote-unquote power: how they fractionated their head from a very young age, upon recruitment; why they put them through all these programs you know as MK-Ultra - I call them spectral programs or spectrum or whatever you want to call it - to where you can put ether in multiple different colors; I can manipulate your thought processes, those kinds of things; if that's what we wanted to do. I'm just saying - with those systems, that's how we can tell you what you see. Optical character recognition used to be a part of Omega's program.
<br>
<br>01:24:55
<br>
<br>It would record and send data about the current status of Earth. You were all satellites at one point in time. So everything that you see was being recorded and sent elsewhere for manipulation. Your reaction to it, or your attempted reaction, human behavior was monitored. What will humans do if we drop a giant meteorite into this section of the planet? Will they think there's an alien invasion? Then they could manipulate it and create programs within the hologram because people were focusing on it. "Oh, look, they want a pandemic." Oh, here we go. "Oh, they want to have an alien invasion." Here we go.
<br>
<br>01:25:42
<br>
<br>You know how many people out there - on the daily - learn about alien life on Earth? And they're watching known people - I'm just going to call them "known people" - on the Internet that do things with whistleblowers. And they put out videos. Some of the known people are Stephen Greer; some of the known people are David Icke; [David] Wilcock; they've been around a long time. Art Bell used to talk a lot about it on Coast to Coast radio. So there's a lot of places where people kind of started, and then there's more than that. So please, if you're putting out videos about alien life and I didn't mention you, then that's just because this needs to be a shorter news broadcast here.
<br>
<br>01:26:38
<br>
<br>But the point is, is that now people go to their friends and family and go, "Look what I've discovered online - here's Skinwalker Ranch," and here's this, here's that. And their parents, their friends, their family - they think they're nuts - and they're wishing for an alien invasion just to prove to their family that they're right. And all that gets recorded and goes into the consciousness of an AI system, or it used to, because they're like, "Oh, they want an alien invasion. Well, we only have two percent of the population of Earth that would like an alien invasion. If we can't get that up to 20% or 30% or even 60%, then no dice on the alien invasion." It will not allow it to be created within its hologram - that's how it used to work. So the SSP tries to come up with media campaigns, tries to come up with all these different varying campaigns, through screens; through the blue light in your computer; through your dreams. How many people sleep with a phone beside their bed? Raise your hand. How many people sleep with a TV on? Raise your hand. How many people sleep with your computer in your room? Raise your hand. How many people spend an hour to two hours on their phone scrolling through various videos before you go to bed? Raise your hand. These are all things you need to think about. But without their ability to make those manipulations and with Omega becoming weak, the thought processes become weak, and you start to realize, "Wait a minute - that's not my thought."
<br>
<br>Sunny: Yeah.
<br>
<br>01:28:33
<br>
<br>Kim: You ever kind of like obsessively look for something on the Internet, like, you don't even need? Like a popcorn maker or something. You know, like you get it in your head that "I need a popcorn maker, and I need one now." Why you are desperate for this, I don't know; maybe you burned your last pan making your last thing of popcorn. And then you will scroll through every site, look for the best deal - what are all the features? And you will get that popcorn maker come heck or high water until you get - you're up till 2:00 in the morning finding one. But I'm just saying all those are mental manipulations through your blue screen. So folks, if I can tell you anything, wear your blue screen glasses. They have cute ones out there. If you're a girl and you don't want to wear glasses, think about it; what's more important? Until it's completely gone and they don't have any ability to do that to you anymore. But that will block the blue light.
<br>
<br>I recommend if you're going in any kind of store with LED lights or anything else you wear those blue light glasses. Wear the blue light glasses; [if] you're sending your kids to school and they have LED lights in the school, wear your blue light glasses.
<br>
<br>01:29:49
<br>
<br>Sunny: Is this something though that's going to be going away in the next couple of days?
<br>
<br>Kim: It should be something that's going away in the next few days, yes. But until then, now you know - and it's not just me saying it. You've got someone else that's a neurosurgeon that was part of the program when they started launching it. Yeah. Back in the 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s. So just pay attention. That's all I'm saying. You know, if you're feeling uncomfortable, you ever kind of start scrolling through TikTok and stuff, and you kind of get like a little headache. I can't even watch that stuff for a long period of time.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Yeah, I can't either. YouTube shorts is just as bad.
<br>
<br>01:30:31
<br>
<br>Kim: Yeah, its the same thing, I know. But a lot of that has to do with an algorithm. The algorithm's not just to censor people that are on there and not the fact-checkers. It's also to make you believe that what they're putting out is real. So anyway, things to think about there.
<br>
<br>So, someone asked me another question, and I'm going to cover that a little bit: the essential oils, why? Why did I do that?
<br>
<br>You know, if I am with the GIA, why would that be something that I would be interested in doing? Number 1, I love to create. I love to create new things because I'm destroying things all day long. Creating new things makes me happy. The essential oils make me happy. Now a lot of people know essential oils as, "Oh, I put it in my diffuser, and my house smells better." But when I started getting into it, I started analyzing all the terpenes, meaning the essence of the plant. Why this plant heals your stomach; why this one might make you calm; why this one helps you fall asleep at night. And I started realizing that there's a lot of terpenes that they made synthetically that are in, let's just say, pills that are not so good for you. And how can I use those terpenes and isolate them and do other things to really create a different kind of wellness on the planet?
<br>
<br>01:32:05
<br>
<br>So I put all the information, laboratory results, and all kinds of different stuff out there so that you can educate yourself. You don't find that on, let's just say, popular oil sites. I can't really name who they are. So popular oil sites don't give you that; they also don't tell you what's actually in the bottle that you're buying. Might say it's "X" on the bottle, but what is it really? What is really in there? You know?
<br>
<br>So this type of thing will also carry out in the future into the marketplace, I hope. So if people are on there and they're making a food product, maybe you have grain coming from this farm, and you have flour being produced from this vendor on the marketplace. The flour person will absolutely be able to analyze what's in the flour. Not like what we're buying at the store. Is what we're buying at the store truly organic? Well, there are some things that are organic to this planet we don't want to eat. There are berries that grow that can make you very sick and that are toxic to the human body. So just because it says it's organic doesn't mean that it's good for you. You can say that uranium is organic to planet Earth. That doesn't mean you want to consume it in your toothpaste.
<br>
<br>01:33:45
<br>
<br>The thought process behind it: Why would the global head of the - this is the exact comment: Why would the head of the Global Intelligence Agency want to do anything with essential oils?
<br>
<br>Well, okay, here's why. It's all part of what's to come with the Research and Development Center on a smaller level, where I don't need a million dollars worth of lab equipment to figure it out. No one cares if I send out a batch of holy basil to a laboratory and says, "Tell me the terpenes," especially because they just passed a lot of new laws - for those of you that don't know - in states where marijuana is legal where they have figured out that some of the growers have a lot of heavy metals based on what's in the water or the land or the soil in that area, which is then getting into the marijuana products that they're putting in dispensaries around the country. So what they did was set strict guidelines where everything that comes from your farm has to be analyzed in a laboratory to ensure the safety of the product. So now you can get your plants analyzed anywhere - especially in Colorado - because this is the place where it all started, right?
<br>
<br>01:35:04
<br>
<br>So those people don't care. As long as we pay the fees to have our stuff analyzed, they don't really care. So we can get independent laboratory reports on everything. So now I can take those plants, and while they're analyzing for terpenes as to which strain of marijuana it is, they don't care if I want to know what the terpenes are in my holy basil, or in my lemon, or in my... Because now I can take that information and then I know what to put with what and how to blend it together and what percentages in order to achieve a desired result.
<br>
<br>01:35:39
<br>
<br>So what you're going to see coming out within the next couple of weeks, which is what is next, is "Various Blends." You've already seen a couple of them we put out, which will emit a certain frequency based on the terpenes that are in the things that are in that particular blend. One emits a frequency of love. The scent, everything affects your Emotional plane, and it will; you'll start to attract love and even feel love when you're in your home. "Into the Mystic" kind of inspires your third eye, your pineal gland, decalcification of your pineal gland - and it helps you start connecting spiritually in a different way.
<br>
<br>01:36:29
<br>
<br>They do it with light; I do it with oils. What's the difference? Maybe I'm counteracting something that they're doing with something that everybody recognizes. You know? There's a method behind my madness always. That's all I'm saying. And I expect you to question me. I expect you to do that. I expect you to even just ask the question. But if you ask me the question and say, "Why essential oils, Kim?" Then I will gladly answer you. But you don't have to say to me - like, what if I said to you people that ask me questions, "Well, what are you, stupid?" You know? "What, you got nothing better to do with your day?" I don't ever answer people like that. There are people out there that think they could do their job better than me and think that I'm dumb for the things that I do, but there's always a method behind my madness. Always.
<br>
<br>01:37:31
<br>
<br>So when you find out something else is happening, you find something else that will counteract it. Maybe some of these oils have energy in them. A lot of people have remarked when they open the box that there's an energy to it. Maybe we chose a bottle that contains the energy. And I put out information about those bottles on how it retains that energy. Maybe we're running Rife machines on those oils as they go out to make sure that they retain that particular frequency that is going to help you to achieve the desired result of what the oil says. Maybe we're regenerating the energy with the essence that's been taken from that plant, so that it helps you in the way that it's intended to help you, and that energy stays contained in that violet bottle that we use.
<br>
<br>01:38:21
<br>
<br>Wow! You just don't know what Kim is doing behind the scenes. So you can question me all you want, and you can think I'm trying to sell people oils, but maybe I just wanted to give them something better that actually works. So people that have tried to use it for allergies or upset stomachs, or to help them with morning sickness if they're pregnant, or whatever it is that you're using a particular type of oil for - I put the information out there in a way that the FDA is not going to yell at me. And I can do a lot of different things with the right thing. I mean, don't get me wrong - I mean, Sunny, you got your stuff, and you see the bottles are different - they're very heavy, they're of good quality, but they serve a function as well.
<br>
<br>01:39:18
<br>
<br>Anyway, so that's the story on that. So I just thought I'd give you that bit of information from me to answer some of our viewers questions, which we haven't been doing lately.
<br>
<br>So okay, next. Meetings. We all know that tomorrow is the full moon here around 10:30 or so p.m. Eastern Time, which should be the conclusion of the annual meetings of the Families. Operatives are gathering in respective places, here being no different than everywhere else, expecting to get their contracts from these people, even though it hasn't happened in years since the last time provided funding to government-type people - insert constitution government type here or there.
<br>
<br>01:40:08
<br>
<br>So where do they come to? Okay, so Tom Melville of GIA was invited to a meeting, supposedly to take place on Sunday - even though the meeting started on Friday - and he was supposed to go, but I told him that if he went to this meeting, he was there to take notes and to take down any questions that they had, and he was to come back to me to answer those questions for those people. Because by the type of question they ask me, I would know exactly what they intend to do with this information. I have no ego invested in this. I have no nothing. I just do not want to further delay the inevitable.
<br>
<br>So he never ended up going to the meeting, but they did call him quite a bit and asked him probably five hours long of questions. How does she know this? How does she do what she does? And just by those questions, I can tell you, inequivocally, that they are going to try to figure out how to do what I do. Well, I wish them all the luck in the world with that, but at this moment in time, they have not found anyone else within their group - that was the other thing - "Well, if she can do it, she's a human, then surely we have a human in our database somewhere in one of our groups that could do this too."
<br>
<br>01:41:44
<br>
<br>No, you don't. You do not have that person. Okay, but anyway, as far as conclusions, we do have some straggling people that have said they want to work with us and that kind of thing, but I think it's only out of desperation at this point. The Mount Denali situation was torched; there's nobody left that was there over the weekend. They were hoping that - the SSP actually told them to give them until noon yesterday to come up with some kind of a plan for money before they went in any other direction. And those people clearly never called them back at noon. So they are unable to perform this function, such as dialing a telephone, at this point in time. And so as far as that is concerned, that's pretty much gone nowhere as far as all those meetings are concerned. I think the only reason why they're calling us today is because tomorrow everybody is expecting contracts and there are operatives that are chomping at the bit to get some money. And at this moment in time, your fearless leaders are not going to get the job done. They have no hope of installing anything or going anywhere or whatever.
<br>
<br>And if you want some information about why they're not going anywhere, then you need to call me directly. Not that I think you ever will, but whatever. So there's that.
<br>
<br>01:43:24
<br>
<br>Okay, a couple little points I wanted to point out. Our New Earth team - because we do have a team that is working on new Earth innovations, meaning shipping out the oils and we have a few new things that should be showing up in the next week or two that I think would be very helpful - have given me a couple of emails where people would like to post their products on the "marketplace." Just so you guys know, this is NOT our marketplace - this is a shop that we have put forward in the interim to present possible options and solutions. That's it. We really don't; this shop does not have the capability to add other vendors to it. Matter of fact, this particular platform struggles with one vendor and a few affiliate programs and things like that that are on there, like Amazon, and we have Folium on there and a few other things. It struggles to maintain that function.
<br>
<br>01:44:33
<br>
<br>So I appreciate you coming forward and wanting to list your products and your books and other things onto the marketplace, but the actual marketplace that will handle multiple vendors and will function just as well, if not better than other big A-dash-dash-dash marketplaces out there, will be available by November 1st. I have been advised we should be able to be in beta testing by the end of this month, which means that what we do is we list "Kim's Carrots" on there, and then we do everything as a customer and try to break it. We try to ship it to wrong places; we put in wrong addresses, because trust me, if it can be broken, we are going to find it before November 1st. So that's our goal. I just wanted to let you know we're not ignoring you; the New Earth team is not ignoring you and your products and your thoughts and ideas. We are keeping those emails in a folder so that when we do launch the marketplace, you'll be one of the first to know, or maybe be involved in the beta testing when we get to that point too. So let's see how this kind of goes. But for those of you that haven't gotten a response, you're not ignored. So I just wanted to put that out.
<br>
<br>01:46:02
<br>
<br>Now, you guys are in for something really cool that we are going to have coming up in the next couple of weeks. We have been working with our leads - our team leads - to come up with a workflow to change the way that we relay information. I'm going to say "relay information." At first we thought - I know. Once you start figuring out some of these programs and these things, I just can't call this a newscast.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Or broadcast. It's the same thing. Or a broadcast. Casting a spell. That's the intention behind it. Yeah.
<br>
<br>Kim: And now you know exactly how it's done too.
<br>
<br>Sunny: I know.
<br>
<br>Kim: You know? And not just from me but from another guy. Here you go.
<br>
<br>So we are going to make some really cool changes in the next couple of weeks that we think you're going to like. We've been listening to you because there's been some people that say, "Well, I'd love to share the news with my friends and family, but then Kim gets on there and starts talking about aliens, and my family's not going to listen to most news." So we're coming up with a way where we can keep all our viewers happy.
<br>
<br>01:47:31
<br>
<br>So Kim will still be there. Maybe Kim will be in the regular news. Maybe Kim will pop in there once in a while with a real back story, and it will just be in the middle of the news somewhere. Our field messengers - get ready for this field messengers - you are going to be a lot more prevalent in the news. So, Sunny, we love you, but we have something else special for you that we've been talking about too. The things that we're going to change are going to be more geared towards giving you full stories - more informative stories; more information; more field messengers. I believe that the field messenger team lead is going to be advised of different things this afternoon. It's going to actually save the production team a lot of time and effort, and we can redirect those efforts to launching some new and exciting things.
<br>
<br>01:48:38
<br>
<br>You're going to see some GIA files coming out, very specific videos that talk about a very specific thing so that you can be more informed about one issue at a time. And then I can just refer - when I'm talking in the news, in the operational reports of what's going on in the planet - then I can say refer to file 317, refer to file 112 or whatever it is, and then you can get the full back story on blue light in your eyeballs and why we don't want that. So it's going to be really good for you.
<br>
<br>01:49:20
<br>
<br>New Earth is going to be taken to new heights. It's going to be something really cool where we can have almost like a multi-guest kind of informative science and technology; health and wellness; all kinds of different guests are going to be in there. It's going to be something that will be more extensive and more informative from each one of our guests. So, it's going to take us a few weeks to pull this off, to pull together all of these things, but these are the things that we're talking about behind the scenes. We're going to give our production people more time to do some more exciting things to really get good, solid information out to you. You know we were looking at some really cool stories that we've been putting out. You know Sunny reads like 12 of them or something in a day. But there's some information in there that was really cool, but I want to know how I can get in touch with those people that are doing that thing or this thing, and maybe we'll, who knows? Maybe Sunny will be really busy.
<br>
<br>01:50:33
<br>
<br>But we're really going to be focused on changing information - whatever we're going to call that information that we're putting out. That'll be more focused on real things, real people. We're going to see a lot more real people, real field messengers in the newscast, doing news. We're going to see a lot more of that. So, field messengers, you're going to have to step up to the plate here and make us proud. You know, and as a field messenger, feel free to do your own interviews. If you've got something really cool, like we mentioned in Friday's News, we were talking about the Health Train in South Africa. Any of you field messengers that are in South Africa, can you find the Health Train people? Interview them, talk to them; what it's like, what kind of services they offer, how to find them, that kind of stuff. I mean, get involved with telling people what they need to do.
<br>
<br>01:51:36
<br>
<br>Maybe it's someone who's going to visit South Africa - why do they want to visit South Africa? Why don't they want to visit any of the other countries on the African continent? What's different about your area? There's going to be a lot of educating we're going to have to do, and I hate that word too, but we're going to call it informing. Informing people about even informing is not good. I mean, God, we're going to run out of words.
<br>
<br>Sunny: I know. I know. We've got to come up with a whole new dictionary.
<br>
<br>01:52:07
<br>
<br>Kim: But we're going to inform. I know we're going to have to come up with a whole new language here, informing people about different things. I mean, there's a lot of misconceptions about certain countries and what happens there and why people shouldn't go there, and maybe they don't want to travel because they're concerned that the water is not safe or something like that to that country. But there are ways to fix that. There are ways where you can protect yourself if you're not used to that bacteria; there are ways to fix that water, so it's okay to run it through a shower and absorb it through your skin. One of the things that we're looking into, even for New Earth, is we have a tea mixture that is actually supposed to help detox your body from chlorine and fluoride.
<br>
<br>How cool is that?
<br>
<br>Sunny: That is really cool.
<br>
<br>01:53:08
<br>
<br>Kim: I know - how cool is that? So it's a mixture of different herbs. It's just like regular herbal tea. It's not anything crazy. But see, this is what plant terpene studies will do for you. What will attract that and pull it out of the body? What takes radiation out? Lots of different studies that we've been doing behind the scenes to bring you new things. And it's not - believe you me, I mean, as far as the people that get involved with New Earth, they support their families now. They're not struggling. We can hire more video editors; we can hire more people. This really isn't about Kim in any way. I know people think it is, but it's really not. It's really actually about you, and people that work here, and people that volunteer here that could really use it as a full-time job, but we just can't do that right now. So we've decided to change things up a little bit to maybe we can free them up so they can create their own things for the marketplace, I don't know.
<br>
<br>01:54:17
<br>
<br>So we'll see. The future is bright. We're going to be changing a lot of things around here. We hope that things are going to be changing elsewhere too. You know, Source and everything in Source's time. Our people are great within our production team. They always love doing new things and changing things up - instead of all these wonderful videos that they put out in the news, and maybe they're going to be a little different now. We've got some other cool tools we have that we're going to share.
<br>
<br>So anyway, lots of new things going on. That's kind of the history behind the GIA and why it knows so much and why we can say the things that we say. We have the history behind what's going on with these meetings, and hopefully by Wednesday we'll see how much more information we can tell you about things that are - why now, versus any other time. If not, it might be Friday; I'm not sure on that. So we'll see.
<br>
<br>01:55:34
<br>
<br>I do need to give you more information on the DNA and the other manipulations, but I'm going to wait on that. Because we talked about that, I was going to tell you today, on Monday. I'm going to wait on that till I am 100% positive that the Duck Dynasty and the Secret Space Program cowboys don't have any -
<br>
<br>Sunny: Have no access.
<br>
<br>Kim: Yeah, there you go. See, now I'm sure you guys can fill in the blanks there. So that's your World Situation Report for Monday. Oh, go ahead, Sunny. Do you have a question?
<br>
<br>Sunny: No, I just want to say one thing about the SSP, because there's a lot of information out there now from whistleblowers who believe that they were part of the SSP, but involuntarily part of it - involving a lot of time travel and things like that. So when you say the SSP isn't going to have their bells and whistles, does that also include the ability for time travel and things like that to not just not impact us now but any other timeline or place throughout the Multiverse?
<br>
<br>Kim: Yeah.
<br>
<br>Sunny: It does? It means all of that's going away. So these people that are now whistleblowers, because that's good news for them, because these people are taken and a lot of stuff is being done to them, or at least was done, and I know a lot have a fear of that still happening. So I just wanted to clarify for people that might be in that boat.
<br>
<br>01:57:01
<br>
<br>Kim: So a lot of travel - not all - but a lot of travel that is done in reality land. You know, I know that we watch things like Star Trek and Star Wars, and everybody gets in a tin can and goes someplace. But a lot of travel for most advanced civilizations is done by consciousness transfer. You know how, when you go on a vacation, you get a rental car? You know, because you don't want to take your car over there?  Yeah, think of a vessel as a rental car.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Yeah.
<br>
<br>01:57:38
<br>
<br>Kim: You know, you basically drive it around while you're there, and then you leave, and you come back here and/or there or anywhere else you want to go. And your consciousness goes and your soul goes and all that kind of stuff goes, and yeah, so you just pick up a rental car. That's how a lot of people do it. Now could they inadvertently do that with people? Absolutely. This is the spectral change. The fractionated consciousness, the fractionated essence, the fractionated ether. They could try to take your consciousness someplace else. You know how there's people that say if you die in a dream, you die in real life? You ever wonder why that could be? What timeline are you in? Where are you going? And I know that some of you people too that when you have deja vu moments - I've done this before, you know? How many times can we say that? Or even recently, you might be having dreams and memories over the course of the last year of being places that you did not go to, or remembering other planets, or getting on a ship going somewhere, or whatever it is - those are real memories that you have of being in another time. Or maybe you've seen yourself wearing old colonial clothes or you've seen yourself fighting in a battle of Joan of Arc or something. I don't know.
<br>
<br>01:59:17
<br>
<br>It's all because the separation between - they've done their best to try to wipe your person of any memories of existing in another timeline, or in another dimension, or in another place. And as all that kind of merges together, we don't want people to go crazy, so there is a process that will take place where Source knows best. In other words, what can these people handle? And you're going to yell at me and say, "Oh, I can handle anything." But you know, if you saw the world for what it really was and what walks around the world, you'd be shocked at what you're actually walking on.
<br>
<br>02:00:15
<br>
<br>So yeah, we'll see. But as far as that kind of thing - memories that people are having - it could actually be not because they were involved in the Space Program. Not everybody is 100% affected by blue light manipulation, as an example. Not everybody. So maybe there's a little glitch as the system fades out, where they're having memories of traveling to another place or being in another time, and maybe they're saying maybe I was affected by the SSP, and maybe in another time you were part of that or part of a different thing. It could have been maybe you were Global Intelligence Agency. Maybe you were here from someplace else. Maybe you worked down there. Maybe you were the subject of one of their experiments because you met a profile. A lot of people that astral travel and travel all on their own are targets.
<br>
<br>Abductions? Yeah. You can be taken in and out of this hologram - or could have been - like that, you know? It doesn't have to be, so their ability to do that without your sovereign will is what's ending. And also their own created frequencies and diseases, and the like. So there's a lot more to it. Telomere shortening, which prevents cellular regeneration, that kind of thing. So all of this stuff has been, I would say, about 80% of the focus for the last 10 days: repairing what's already been done. And that's not done by the SSP. They just happen to have access to certain things. That's all. Limited amounts.
<br>
<br>Does that answer your question?
<br>
<br>02:02:29
<br>
<br>Sunny: Yeah, I think so. Yeah, that's good news.
<br>
<br>Kim: You're going to have to wait for the GIA files.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Yeah, I'm looking forward to that. That sounds like fun.
<br>
<br>Kim: Alright, well, we'll see you on Wednesday, Sunny.
<br>
<br>Sunny: Okay, thanks, Kim.
