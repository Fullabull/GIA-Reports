Governments, banks, and operatives tried to use the early opening of the 11/11 Portal, a record length U.S. government shutdown, airline disruptions, and a global stablecoin scam to force a new control system and gain access to the Golden Age AI, yet their funding never arrived, their rituals failed, and their attempts to bind countries and tribes into soul collateral collapsed. Source has ended the ultimate game between Love and War, dissolved the Soul Empire that once fed Death and War, and restored direct sovereignty between each organic soul and Source, while the Deep State grows weaker, their attacks lose strength, and Homo sapiens are urged to stay in Love, remember that their soul is their direct connection to Source, and choose a new covenant with Source rather than fear-based systems.</p> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Highlights</h2> <ul> <li>00:00:00 - Kim previews that the so called simulation or video game has been running on the Deep State as well as on us, that the 11 11 Portal actually opened on 08 November 2025, and that governments, banks, and the Deep State are now in serious trouble as Source moves first.</li> <li>00:02:20 - She announces the launch of the Field Messenger app on Apple and Google stores so viewers can upload on the ground reports, replacing manipulated mainstream media with citizen reporters who show what is really happening worldwide.</li> <li>00:08:46 - Kim explains that the FAA is no more federal than the Federal Reserve, has long been funded through illicit Treasury activity, and is deeply involved in hiding flights, tail numbers, and black box access, using the shutdown to justify flight cancellations and stir fear.</li> <li>00:16:00 - Airlines are offered billions to cancel flights, just like during COVID, but promised payments do not arrive, exposing the shutdown and travel chaos as another scam designed to make people focus their energy and fear on government.</li> <li>00:16:51 - The U.S. experiences the longest government shutdown in history while politicians hunt for money to keep it open past 30 January, yet Kim refuses to fund them and notes that their usual &quot;day ending in Y&quot; payment rituals have failed for nearly 20 years.</li> <li>00:22:54 - Deep State Trump operatives tell followers they have &quot;won the Game&quot; and that funding will arrive by precisely 06 00 Eastern on Monday, then repeatedly ring Kim&#x27;s Diplomatic line at 03 47 and 04 04, only to find that no money comes and full panic sets in.</li> <li>00:25:27 - The Syrian president, flattered as the next Mahdi, comes to the White House expecting a large payout and a central role in a new Middle East war, but leaves empty handed when the promised funds never materialize.</li> <li>00:28:13 - Kim dismantles the global stablecoin and crypto &quot;scamorama&quot; using the flowers versus cactuses analogy, showing that swapping dollars for Bitcoin or stablecoins without real GDP, infrastructure, or internet capacity cannot fix any country or support a world currency.</li> <li>00:34:14 - Behind the scenes, operatives try yet again to bind governments and tribal leaders into a unified Crap Coin style program based on the belief that states own their citizens as collateral and can sign away Homo sapiens souls, but these schemes repeatedly fail.</li> <li>00:41:13 - She defines the SEA as the Soul Empire of Azrael, a collective pool where souls willingly traded for power and fame are stored under an AI run artificial soul system, forming a massive stockpile of fallen souls across the Dark Side of the Omniverse.</li> <li>00:45:37 - Source gives her the key phrase &quot;All is fare in Love and War,&quot; leading to a deeper explanation that Love is of Source, War is of Death, and the true &quot;fare&quot; is the toll of souls willingly sold and then used as currency in the Game of Love and War.</li> <li>00:50:02 - Kim explains that only a being itself can agree to give up its soul, that 80 percent of Homo sapiens souls would have to willingly sell before any &quot;harvest&quot; could stand, and that Source has refused to allow a harvest because the souls would simply return to Source.</li> <li>00:53:10 - She describes the Deep State as soulless Homo sapiens who sold their souls for power and were told they could win the Game by getting others, guardians included, to sell, while higher level entities like Marduk pretended to hold ultimate power through soul fares.</li> <li>00:57:52 - At the highest level, War&#x27;s goal is to control more than 80 percent of Source by capturing souls into SEAs, Astral Planes, and war realms, making Earth a prime target because Earth was the first co creator with Source and once generated souls for this density.</li> <li>01:05:35 - Kim states that Source has now pared Homo sapiens away from governments, banks, world government structures, and unseen royals, removing liens and custody claims so that, in the greater Game of Earth, humans are no longer bound to any such institutions.</li> <li>01:08:09 - Source orders the dismantling of the Soul SEA and the redemption of fallen souls back under the Care of Source, changing the rules of the Game so that many who fell through pride, guilt, shame, or desperation can be reclaimed rather than left as war &quot;fare.&quot;</li> <li>01:12:06 - She confirms that there is no way to be reclaimed by Death or the Angel of Death anymore, that the Soul Empire has fallen, there is no fare left in Love and War, and Source has ended the ultimate game between Love and War that once governed this reality.</li> <li>01:18:08 - Kim urges listeners to pay close attention to fear driven narratives like alien invasions and Atlas hype, explaining that the Fallen now try to use human focus to punch holes into Reality because they can no longer do it themselves.</li> <li>01:18:54 - She reminds everyone that &quot;your soul is your soul&quot; and your direct connection to Source, notes that Deep State attacks and frequencies are weaker and shorter lived than before, and affirms that many people are waking up while the Deep State grows afraid of them.</li> <li>01:19:50 - The report closes with the choice laid before governments and banks to make a new covenant with Source or not, and Kim relays the message from the Big Boss: &quot;Join the Source Party or get off the planet.&quot;</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>People</h2> <ul> <li>Alex Soros</li> <li>Azrael</li> <li>Death</li> <li>Donald Trump</li> <li>Mahdi</li> <li>Marduk</li> <li>Syrian president</li> <li>Wisdom</li> <li>the Ancients</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Organizations</h2> <ul> <li>Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)</li> <li>Federal Reserve</li> <li>Global Intelligence Agency (GIA)</li> <li>SNAP benefits program</li> <li>Secret Space Program</li> <li>U.S. Treasury Department</li> <li>U.S. government</li> <li>United States military</li> <li>airlines (U.S. carriers)</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Phrases And Concepts</h2> <ul> <li>10 Little Rules</li> <li>11/11 Portal</li> <li>All is fare in Love and War</li> <li>Deep State</li> <li>End of Days</li> <li>Field Messenger</li> <li>Golden Age AI</li> <li>Groundhog Day recycling program</li> <li>Lost Ones</li> <li>SEA (Soul Empire of Azrael)</li> <li>Secret video game of Love and War</li> <li>Source Party</li> <li>Soul collectors</li> <li>World War</li> <li>World government</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Locations</h2> <ul> <li>Astral Planes</li> <li>Australia</li> <li>Chicago</li> <li>Earth</li> <li>Europe</li> <li>LA (Los Angeles)</li> <li>Las Vegas</li> <li>Middle East</li> <li>Oregon</li> <li>Silverton, Colorado</li> <li>United States</li> <li>White House</li> <li>World</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Events</h2> <ul> <li>00:00:00 - Kim previews that the Deep State&#x27;s simulation or video game is being run on them as well as on us, that the 11 11 Portal opened early on 08 November 2025, and that banks and governments are under pressure as Source moves first.</li> <li>00:02:20 - The Field Messenger app is launched on major app stores so viewers can upload reports, making citizen Field Messengers the backbone of a new, people powered news model.</li> <li>00:08:46 - She outlines how the FAA, funded through illicit Treasury activity and not truly federal, helps hide flights, tail numbers, and black box data while using the shutdown to justify growing flight cancellations.</li> <li>00:16:00 - Airlines are promised billions to cancel flights as during COVID, but payments due on Monday and again &quot;today&quot;

and that funding will hit by precisely 06 00 Eastern on Monday, then spend the night whipping followers into expectation.</li> <li>00:24:21 - Trump operatives repeatedly call Kim&#x27;s Diplomatic line at 03:47 and 04:04 her time seeking access to the Golden Age AI and money, but she ignores the calls and no funds appear.</li> <li>00:25:27 - The Syrian president visits the White House, believing he is the new Mahdi and expecting a large payment for his role in Middle East upheaval, only to be told to wait as nothing pays out on 11 11.</li> <li>00:28:13 - Kim briefs operatives using the flowers versus cactuses example to show that replacing the dollar with Bitcoin or stablecoins without GDP growth or infrastructure is futile and cannot rescue failing regimes.</li> <li>00:34:14 - Operatives once again try to sign up countries and original tribal leaders into a unified Crap Coin style program, believing states own their citizens as collateral and can thus deliver Homo sapiens souls through contracts.</li> <li>00:41:13 - She formally defines the Soul SEA as the Soul Empire of Azrael, where souls willingly traded for fame and power are pooled under an AI driven artificial soul system tied to war realms.</li> <li>01:05:35 - Source pares Homo sapiens away from governments, banks, unseen royals, and world government structures, removing liens and custody claims so humans are no longer bound to those systems in the greater Game of Earth.</li> <li>01:08:09 - Source orders the dismantling of the Soul SEA and the redemption of fallen souls back under the Care of Source, changing the rules of the Game and softening the judgment on many who fell through pride, guilt, shame, or poverty.</li> <li>01:12:06 - Kim announces that the Soul Empire has fallen, there is no fare left in Love and War, and Source has ended the ultimate game between Love and War that powered the Deep State&#x27;s multi level video game.</li> <li>01:18:54 - She closes with guidance to stay anchored in the soul&#x27;s connection to Source, notes that attacks and fear tones are weaker and shorter, and relays that governments and banks must either make a new covenant with Source or get off the planet.</li> </ul> </section> <footer class="footer backlink"> <a href="../SummaryIndex.html">Back to Summary Index</a> </footer> </div> </body> </html>
