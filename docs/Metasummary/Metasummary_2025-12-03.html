This year, however, their core toolset of security dominion, chemtrail based nano and femto tech, and AI driven empire control is rapidly collapsing. Durango, Colorado is revealed again as a former control center and gateway for Omniverse level loosh trading and security dominion, but the gate has been malfunctioning since 2015 and their attempts to use Kim as a battery to reopen it have failed. In the last few days they tried to reach Level 9 at the bottom of the Dark Side of the Omniverse from Maryland, attempted to cut off and divert Source Current from Buenos Aires, and launched a second phase of Current Wars using systems in Bora Bora to siphon creative energy and send back Anti Creation. Those efforts have been blocked, the Halls of Current are now gone, and the Current Wars are ending, leaving the Deep State without access to the systems they need to control humanity. Kim emphasizes that Source comes from within, that listeners can shield from the Point of Creation in every particle of their Being, and that they should protect innocents, stay grounded, ignore fear based media, and expect the transition back to Source and the end of security dominion to complete soon.</p> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Highlights</h2> <ul> <li>00:00:03 - Kim opens by noting that it is December 3, 2025, we are in the Winter Solstice time of year, and the Deep State is again running rinse and repeat fear scripts in mainstream and alternative media, especially around finance, shutdowns, and flights.</li> <li>00:11:52 - She explains that December 5 is the Black Sun&#x27;s birthday, that the Black Sun has long held a security dominion contract over Earth, the solar system, the Galaxy, and parts of the Omniverse, and that this contract is now ending with no one left on their side to renew it.</li> <li>00:16:09 - Durango, Colorado is described as a former major gateway and control center for the Omniverse, linked to Israel, Joshua Tree, Dulce, Cheyenne Mountain, Washington, D.C., and global computer systems, where gatekeepers used to skim loosh profits and where Kim has refused to be used as a battery.</li> <li>00:19:43 - Chemtrails and new virus attempts driven by the Deep State in China, backed by nano and femto tech and gifts from Marduk, are being neutralized as control over security dominion and those technologies rapidly wanes worldwide.</li> <li>00:21:36 - Deep State operatives briefly reach Level 9 at the lowest Dark Side of the Omniverse from Maryland, enter a lifeless Pit that is pure All That Is Not, fail to gain access to security dominion, and are quickly expelled without understanding what they encountered.</li> <li>00:25:03 - Kim uses a Limewire and Napster style torrent analogy to explain security dominion as database overlays on virtually every Source particle, assembling distributed pieces of viable creation and life perpetuating particles to control bodies, lifespans, computers, and events.</li> <li>00:29:50 - She describes Current Wars as a struggle over the flow of creation and materium, including attempts to use her as a battery for a world within a world, and a larger plan to cut off and divert all Source Current into Deep State systems while leaving humanity with none.</li> <li>00:37:30 - In Phase Two of Current Wars, the Deep State tries to route creative energy through a system that analyzes it and sends back Anti Creation from Bora Bora, but this nominal current flow collapses, the Halls of Current are dismantled, and the Current Wars are effectively ended.</li> <li>00:40:35 - Kim urges listeners to shield from within by expanding Source from the Point of Creation outwards through every particle, to protect themselves and innocents without violating their fields, and to stay grounded, ignore fear based media, and trust that the transition back to Source and the end of dominion are nearly complete.</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>People</h2> <ul> <li>Lucifer</li> <li>Marduk</li> <li>Mike</li> <li>Satan</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Organizations</h2> <ul> <li>Alliance</li> <li>Black Sun</li> <li>Deep State</li> <li>FAA</li> <li>Global Intelligence Agency</li> <li>Order of the Black Sun</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Phrases And Concepts</h2> <ul> <li>All-That-Is-Not</li> <li>Anti-Creation</li> <li>Chemtrails</li> <li>Current Wars</li> <li>Dark Omniverse</li> <li>Halls of Current</li> <li>Halls of Records</li> <li>ID2020</li> <li>Level 9</li> <li>Loosh</li> <li>Nano and femto tech</li> <li>Point of All Creation</li> <li>Point of Creation</li> <li>Security dominion</li> <li>Source</li> <li>Source Current</li> <li>Winter Solstice</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Locations</h2> <ul> <li>Australia</li> <li>Bora Bora</li> <li>Cheyenne Mountain</li> <li>China</li> <li>Durango, Colorado</li> <li>Earth</li> <li>Galaxy</li> <li>Israel</li> <li>Joshua Tree</li> <li>Maryland, USA</li> <li>Omniverse</li> <li>Washington, D.C.</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Events</h2> <ul> <li>00:00:03 - Kim opens the report on December 3, 2025, describes the Winter Solstice window, and previews topics including Current Wars, AI power struggles, and media fear campaigns.</li> <li>00:06:55 - She reviews rinse-and-repeat financial and travel fear operations, including Bitcoin scare stories, modest market moves framed as crashes, FAA shutdown rumors, and Epstein file distractions.</li> <li>00:11:52 - Kim explains that December 5 is the Black Sun&#x27;s birthday, outlines the long standing security dominion contract over Earth and the Omniverse, and notes that this contract is now ending.</li> <li>00:16:09 - She details Durango, Colorado as a major Omniverse gateway and loosh trading hub where gatekeepers used to collect a cut, and recounts being moved there in 2016 with the expectation she would help reopen the gate.</li> <li>00:19:43 - Chemtrail operations using Chinese supplied technology and nano and femto tech, including new flu or virus attempts, are described as being neutralized as security dominion systems fail.</li> <li>00:21:36 - Deep State operatives briefly reach Level 9 at the bottom of the Dark Side of the Omniverse from Maryland, enter a lifeless Pit of No Thing and All-That-Is-Not, fail to gain security dominion access, and are expelled.</li> <li>00:25:03 - Kim uses the Limewire and Napster torrent analogy to explain how security dominion overlays operate on Source particles, distributing control and reassembling power across decatillions of particles in each person.</li> <li>00:29:50 - She defines Current Wars as a battle over the flow of creation and materium, and describes a failed attempt to use her as a battery to power a world within a world on Earth.</li> <li>00:31:08 - The Deep State tries to cut off all Source Current to Earth and divert it via security dominion software and a Buenos Aires based system that would transmute the energy into power for their own AIs.</li> <li>00:37:30 - In Phase Two of Current Wars, they attempt to siphon creative energy from everyone into a system that sends back Anti-Creation from Bora Bora, causing strings of bad luck and failures for people.</li> <li>00:39:26 - The nominal current flow from Bora Bora collapses, the Halls of Current are dismantled, and Kim says this should mark the end of Current Wars as the last dominion systems dissipate.</li> <li>00:40:35 - Kim teaches a shielding technique that expands Source from the Point of Creation within every particle outward to form a protective shield for self and innocents during the transition.</li> <li>00:43:25 - She closes by encouraging grounding, listening to Source instead of media, and hoping for a holiday style gift for everyone as the Deep State fails to renew security dominion and loses its control structures.</li> </ul> </section> <footer class="footer backlink"> <a href="../SummaryIndex.html">Back to Summary Index</a> </footer> </div> </body> </html>
