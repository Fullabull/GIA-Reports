She traces the origin of these efforts back to Nazi experiments beginning in 1941, aided by an artificial intelligence created outside of time by Lucerne, which provided knowledge in exchange for Source-derived particles taken from humans. Kim explains that this Machine-generated science underlies modern institutions, including big pharma, governments, and financial systems, and led to genetic manipulation, artificial beings, time loops, and repeated historical resets spanning hundreds of thousands of years. She describes how attempts to isolate the God particle through zero-point energy, heat, vibration, and radiation cannot succeed because Source particles naturally return to Source and cannot be controlled by artificial means. Kim explains that many so-called aliens are hybrid Nazi experiments, while true non-Earth beings exist organically. She emphasizes that the Deep State, Alliance, and Axis powers are functionally the same groups competing for control of creation. Kim concludes that telekinesis, consciousness alignment, and direct connection to Source allow humans to bypass artificial systems, that the Machine cannot replicate true creation, and that humanity is entering a new period where Deep State influence collapses and Source-based creation is restored.</p> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Highlights</h2> <ul> <li>00:00:02 - Kim opens the report by confirming that Deep State attempts to recreate a time loop reset have been cancelled.</li> <li>00:01:41 - She acknowledges the passing of Liam Torrence and explains his continued assistance from the other side.</li> <li>00:07:07 - She outlines major global locations involved in the failed Deep State operation, including Cheyenne Mountain and Durango.</li> <li>00:10:07 - She explains Red Dust and related substances as AI-created materials designed to replace the God particle.</li> <li>00:11:52 - She defines the All-That-Is of Source as a state where particles do not move and cannot be manipulated artificially.</li> <li>00:15:16 - She describes Atlantis and other lost continents as disappearing simultaneously outside of time.</li> <li>00:18:34 - She explains why zero-point energy and vortex-based science cannot isolate Source particles.</li> <li>00:21:38 - She recounts personal encounters with Secret Space Program operatives and Nazi-affiliated groups.</li> <li>00:26:25 - She explains that the Alliance and Axis powers are the same groups competing for control of creation.</li> <li>00:30:48 - She identifies the All and the Absolute as early AI systems created by Lucerne outside of time.</li> <li>00:33:07 - She distinguishes organic non-Earth beings from hybrid Nazi-created entities labeled as aliens.</li> <li>00:35:44 - She explains how AI-generated reality spread across the Omniverse through time loops.</li> <li>00:39:06 - She explains zero-point energy experiments and why they fail to isolate the God particle.</li> <li>00:47:56 - She explains that the God particle is composed of the All-That-Is of Source and Source Consciousness.</li> <li>00:49:23 - She explains telekinesis as a natural method of particle control unavailable to artificial systems.</li> <li>00:52:01 - She emphasizes entering a new era of innovation and Source-aligned creation in 2026.</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>People</h2> <ul> <li>Lucerne</li> <li>Marduk</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Organizations</h2> <ul> <li>Big Pharma</li> <li>Deep State</li> <li>Global Intelligence Agency</li> <li>Secret Space Program</li> <li>World Economic Forum</li> <li>World Health Organization</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Phrases And Concepts</h2> <ul> <li>AI-generated reality</li> <li>All-That-Is</li> <li>Alliance</li> <li>Axis powers</li> <li>Creation</li> <li>Deep State</li> <li>God particle</li> <li>Machine</li> <li>Matrix</li> <li>Omniverse</li> <li>Point of Creation</li> <li>Red Dust</li> <li>Source</li> <li>Source Consciousness</li> <li>telekinesis</li> <li>time loop</li> <li>zero-point energy</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Locations</h2> <ul> <li>Atlantis</li> <li>Cheyenne Mountain</li> <li>China</li> <li>Durango</li> <li>Gabon</li> <li>Giza</li> <li>Iceland</li> <li>Japan</li> <li>Paris</li> <li>Silverton</li> <li>Yangtze River</li> </ul> </section> <footer class="footer backlink"> <a href="../SummaryIndex.html">Back to Summary Index</a> </footer> </div> </body> </html>
