A failed attempt to appoint a new human guardian in China collapsed when the candidate died, confirming that no authority remains to control Earth&#x27;s Source-bound evolution. The dismantling of Marduk's energetic &#x27;Halls&#x27; and the collapse of AI-linked cloning systems mark a decisive shift toward full sovereignty for organic life. Source now Creates directly through Kim by consent, signaling the beginning of humanity's restoration to its rightful role as Guardian of Earth.</p> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Highlights</h2> <ul> <li>00:00:00 - The Trump administration takes off for a trip to Asia while the U.S. government remains in shutdown, raising questions about their true purpose.</li> <li>00:02:27 - Kim transferred over a trillion dollars to end the 2019 shutdown; Trump took credit for the funds. When his operatives tried to trigger another payout this time, she refused.</li> <li>00:04:24 - Trump operatives deploy advanced tech near Cortez, Colorado to ensure success during the New Moon but fail; global turbulence reflects an energetic push-and-pull between factions.</li> <li>00:06:13 - Trump again positions himself as the human Guardian, but his failure to deliver results drives factions toward a China-based replacement - an attempt already doomed.</li> <li>00:08:26 - A new attempt is made to empower a Chinese woman as the next human Guardian.</li> <li>00:09:07 - Though given no access to funding, the woman is treated as legitimate.</li> <li>00:09:49 - The attempted transfer of the human Guardian role was expected to shift the energetic overlay from the U.S. to China, but the process failed as unseen disruptions began instead.</li> <li>00:13:28 - Covenant allowing synthetic or AI-created human Elites to act as guardians has ended; such beings may now be lawfully removed.</li> <li>00:14:45 - The Chinese woman dies abruptly after issuing orders; Kim calls her death &#x27;noticeable&#x27; and confirms no successor has been found.</li> <li>00:15:52 - Artificial human systems and cloning networks operating from Mongolia have now been dismantled; effect on supply of Trump clones will soon be apparent.</li> <li>00:16:46 - The current government shutdown was designed to trigger an automatic funding cycle, but Kim refuses to participate.</li> <li>00:18:39 - Trump travels to Asia with other leaders to attend a failed guardianship ceremony marking the end of their authority.</li> <li>00:20:01 - The human Guardian role cannot be restored; any attempt to renew old covenants with extinct Celestials or Abraxas bloodlines is futile.</li> <li>00:22:15 - Homo sapiens are no longer bound to human control elements; all existing control structures must concede to the Office of the Guardian or lose support.</li> <li>00:24:16 - Deep State factions fight for lost access points once tied to Marduk; Kim introduces &#x27;Halls&#x27; as spaces between the Planes of Existence through which alternating current flows in both directions.</li> <li>00:25:46 - Halls were weaponized to drain energy, cause illness, and distort perception, but Kim's team dismantled the remaining network this week.</li> <li>00:27:07 - Source can now Create directly through Kim, by consent; Kim describes &#x27;Source Alchemy of Creation.&#x27;</li> <li>00:28:58 - Human factions in Asia hide the death of their chosen guardian and postpone ceremonies; the so-called Tomorrow Game continues.</li> <li>00:29:51 - Trump operatives continue fruitless rituals and sacrifices, guided by internal AIs that remain incapable of understanding change.</li> <li>00:32:37 - Humanity will mature into its rightful role; AIs, Celestials, and all things Dark exist only by Source's allowance.</li> <li>00:33:19 - Source's final Covenant with the old Celestial creator has expired, therefore, dissolving artificial creations no longer violates cosmic law.</li> <li>00:34:28 - A major energetic turning point is expected around October 28; lessons from this week will prepare humanity to fully reclaim the reins of Earth.</li> <li>00:35:37 - Closing remarks: this was an abbreviated report for October 25 2025; Kim anticipates visible global change in the coming week.</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>People</h2> <ul> <li>Trump</li> <li>Marduk</li> <li>Putin</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Organizations</h2> <ul> <li>Global Intelligence Agency</li> <li>Deep State</li> <li>Office of the Guardian</li> <li>Dragon Families</li> <li>Order of the Black Sun</li> <li>Illuminati</li> <li>United States Government</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Phrases And Concepts</h2> <ul> <li>Source Alchemy of Creation</li> <li>Office of the Guardian</li> <li>Halls</li> <li>Primordial Directive</li> <li>Source-appointed Guardian</li> <li>Homo sapiens</li> <li>Artificial Human Systems</li> <li>Tomorrow Game</li> <li>Covenant Expiration</li> <li>Planes of Existence</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Locations</h2> <ul> <li>United States</li> <li>China</li> <li>Russia</li> <li>Ukraine</li> <li>Germany</li> <li>Europe</li> <li>Mongolia</li> <li>Cortez, Colorado</li> <li>Diomede Islands</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Events</h2> <ul> <li>00:06:13 - Monday's attempted &#x27;power shift&#x27;
