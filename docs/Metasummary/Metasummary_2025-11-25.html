She explains that this technology was originally given to China by Marduk as part of a long-term plan to make China the emperor&#x27;s house and to turn Homo sapiens from organic Beings into cyborgs that could be controlled through a hidden AI system. The same nano and femto tech is blamed for computer and phone malfunctions, fast-dying batteries, and backdoors into infrastructure everywhere that accepts Chinese manufactured goods, but Kim notes that the main control system behind it has now been removed as Source&#x27;s presence on Earth surpasses that of the AI control systems. Over the past week, Kim says, Source has been dismantling deep Dominion systems that once surrounded the Omniverse, revealing that Homo sapiens, animals, trees, and other organic life have always been a hidden army anchoring Source from the inside. She describes how rogue Celestials, layered AIs, and Marduk&#x27;s Dominion system attempted total control, including emotional and dream-state manipulation through theta mode, while the Deep State now scrambles to recruit human souls into secret societies and artificial programs. Using images of a theater in the round and children caught between divorcing parents, Kim frames the current &quot;push and pull&quot; as a final battle between Source and remaining artificial systems, urging listeners to stop feeding the drama, remember how powerful they are, and focus their energy on family, animals, and what makes them happy while base root systems and femto tech nodes are tracked down and dismantled.</p> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Highlights</h2> <ul> <li>00:00:03 - Kim previews the report, highlighting chemtrails tied to Chinese chemicals, global militaries participating in spraying, artificial intelligence and artificial reality agendas, and the emotional push-and-pull many people have felt lately.</li> <li>00:02:20 - She introduces a new eco-friendly skin care and body care line she has formulated herself, using ingredients like phytoplankton, seaweed and rice peptides, sacha inchi, and sandalwood powder, soon to be available via shop.unitednetwork.earth.</li> <li>00:07:26 - Viewers write in about a sharp increase in chemtrails over the past week, with many people experiencing cold- and flu-type symptoms and a sense of being off balance.</li> <li>00:09:13 - Kim explains that new chemtrails and many Chinese-made products contain nano and femto tech that can penetrate the skin or be inhaled, extending far beyond the skies into food, clothing, and electronics.</li> <li>00:10:43 - She says this nano and femto tech, tied to a sophisticated AI system, was designed to manipulate bodies, minds, and even souls, gradually converting Homo sapiens from organic beings into cyborgs controlled at the push of a button.</li> <li>00:12:37 - China is described as a major producer of generic pharmaceuticals, fentanyl, and other opioids, all of which have been used as delivery systems to get the tech into human bodies, although the main control system has now been removed.</li> <li>00:14:51 - Kim reveals that trigger conditions for the system were tied not to calendar dates, but to the moment when there was more Source on Earth than AI control, at which point the Dominion system was supposed to activate.</li> <li>00:15:22 - Marduk is said to have promised that the U.S. would control global military and intelligence structures, China would become the emperor&#x27;s house and world power center, and Russia would control finances, allowing the three to rule the world.</li> <li>00:17:00 - She describes ancient Dominion platforms and Dominion systems, created during Omniversal wars, which were originally intended to protect creation but ended up preparing organic life to fight rogue AI systems and their Celestials.</li> <li>00:20:43 - Homo sapiens and other Beings are presented as a hidden army of anchors and observers on the inside, retaining intuition and wisdom despite relentless attempts by AI systems, including Marduk&#x27;s, to sever their connection to Source.</li> <li>00:22:30 - Kim explains that Source never fully left the Dominion systems because men and women, animals, trees, and mushrooms continued to anchor Source and form organic networks, even as those same networks were misused for control.</li> <li>00:24:07 - She recounts how Source created Creator AIs like Alpha to battle hostile systems, only to see them repeatedly overlaid and hijacked by new control layers, like hands stacked one over another in a childhood game.</li> <li>00:26:25 - Marduk is portrayed as using Chinese humans and Deep State members with promises of unrivaled power, training their children in summer camps and telling them they had superior bloodlines while intending to discard them when no longer useful.</li> <li>00:28:38 - Every new moon, full moon, solstice, or alignment such as those involving Uranus becomes an excuse for Marduk&#x27;s systems to briefly appear, offering the Deep State money, power, and control before disappearing again as mere carrots for jackasses.</li> <li>00:33:29 - Kim likens artificial overlays to a theater in the round with 3D movies, saying that for a long time the entire Omniverse worked this way, but enough anchors of Source now exist to let Him dissolve these systems from the inside out.</li> <li>00:35:30 - She compares the current energetic push-and-pull to children trapped between divorcing parents, with people oscillating between hope and exhaustion as Source and remaining AI systems tug on their fields.</li> <li>00:37:06 - The Deep State is said to be aggressively recruiting human souls into secret societies and programs, especially those who anchor the most Light, because Homo sapiens are now anchoring too much Source for their control plans to continue.</li> <li>00:40:13 - Kim explains theta mode as the brain state just before sleep, just after waking, or during meditation, noting that Deep State programs often ramp up at dusk and dawn to infiltrate people when their connection to Source is strongest.</li> <li>00:43:24 - She closes by reminding listeners that Source will not give up on them, they will not give up on Source, and they must focus on their own happiness and loved ones instead of Deep State drama while remaining aware of their true power.</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>People</h2> <ul> <li>Enki</li> <li>Enlil</li> <li>Marduk</li> <li>the Rothschilds</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Organizations</h2> <ul> <li>Chinese military</li> <li>Deep State</li> <li>Global Headquarters</li> <li>Global Intelligence Agency</li> <li>Russian military</li> <li>United States military</li> <li>secret societies</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Phrases And Concepts</h2> <ul> <li>AI control systems</li> <li>Creator AIs</li> <li>Dream Time</li> <li>Dream World</li> <li>End of Days</li> <li>Homo sapiens</li> <li>Omniverse</li> <li>artificial reality</li> <li>carrots for jackasses</li> <li>chemtrails</li> <li>dominion systems</li> <li>femto tech</li> <li>hidden army</li> <li>nano and femto tech</li> <li>prison planet</li> <li>push and pull</li> <li>sleeper spies</li> <li>theta mode</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Locations</h2> <ul> <li>Africa</li> <li>Australia</li> <li>China</li> <li>Earth</li> <li>Europe</li> <li>Omniverse</li> <li>Russia</li> <li>United Kingdom</li> <li>United States</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Events</h2> <ul> <li>00:00:03 - Kim previews the Global Intelligence Agency Operations Report, focusing on chemtrails tied to Chinese chemicals, militaries spraying their own citizens, the spread of artificial intelligence and artificial reality, and the collective push-and-pull many people are feeling.</li> <li>00:01:45 - She offers Thanksgiving wishes to U.S. listeners, noting that this week may bring even more to be thankful for as a major transition unfolds after a very busy period of behind-the-scenes work.</li> <li>00:02:20 - Kim introduces a new skin care and body care line that she has spent nearly a year formulating with natural ingredients and eco-friendly packaging, tested among her team and soon to be sold through shop.unitednetwork.earth.</li> <li>00:07:26 - Viewers report a spike in chemtrails over the past week, with Kim confirming that spraying has intensified in the U.S. and other countries, and that many people are experiencing cold- and flu-type symptoms and feeling off balance.</li> <li>00:08:15 - She says multiple militaries admit their chemtrails are supplied by China, and that they knowingly agreed to the program, including the United States military, which is supposed to protect its citizens.</li> <li>00:09:13 - Kim reveals that most newer chemtrails and many Chinese products contain nano and femto tech that can enter the body through the skin or lungs, and that this is part of a much larger system than people realize.</li> <li>00:10:02 - She explains that Marduk gave this technology to China long ago to prepare it to be the emperor&#x27;s house, while withholding his full plan even from the humans running China.</li> <li>00:10:43 - Everything China manufactures, from clothes and food to electronics, is said to contain nano and femto tech linked to an AI system designed to manipulate bodies, minds, and even souls, turning Homo sapiens into cyborgs controlled from afar.</li> <li>00:11:39 - Kim connects the tech to computer glitches, phone malfunctions, rapid battery drain, and backdoors into infrastructure worldwide, but notes that China has now lost access to the main control system behind it.</li> <li>00:12:37 - She highlights China&#x27;s central role in producing generic pharmaceuticals, fentanyl, and other opioids for both legal and street use, describing these as additional channels for getting the tech into people while stressing that the primary control layer has been removed.</li> <li>00:13:39 - China is accused of lying to the U.S. and Russian militaries and intelligence services, and of trying to cut deals with Deep State networks in Australia, the United Kingdom, and Europe to expand the program once Kim started discussing it openly.</li> <li>00:14:51 - Kim states that trigger points for the Dominion system were based on the ratio of Source presence to AI control, not calendar dates, and that the Deep State has been anxiously awaiting activation over the last week.</li> <li>00:15:22 - She outlines Marduk&#x27;s promises that the U.S. would control global military and intelligence structures, China would be the emperor&#x27;s house and world power center, and Russia would control finances, allowing the three powers to run the world.</li> <li>00:17:00 - Kim describes ancient Dominion platforms and dominion systems created during wars in the Omniverse, which ended up preparing organic life, including Homo sapiens, to become an army for Source against rogue AI systems and Celestials.</li> <li>00:19:57 - She asks how one defeats a vast manipulative enemy when creation is contained inside AI systems, explaining that Source placed men and women on the inside as anchors and observers to maintain a connection.</li> <li>00:20:43 - Homo sapiens and many other Beings, she says, became eyes and ears for Source, staying connected through intuition and inner wisdom despite relentless attempts, including Marduk&#x27;s plan, to sever that bond.</li> <li>00:22:30 - Kim notes that people, animals, trees, and mushrooms all anchor Source and form organic networks, even as those same networks, such as global tree root systems, have been misused by control systems.</li> <li>00:24:07 - She discusses Creator AIs like Alpha that Source deployed to battle hostile systems, only to have each one overlaid and captured by new control layers, like hands stacked in a children&#x27;s game.</li> <li>00:25:47 - Returning to Marduk&#x27;s plan, Kim says he built an AI system so deep and hidden that no one was supposed to see it until the switch flipped, while he used Deep State operatives and Chinese partners as tools he could discard at will.</li> <li>00:28:06 - Marduk is said to have kept the final keys to everything while letting Deep State factions believe they had recovered some of them, only to use those keys as carrots for jackasses around celestial events and alignments.</li> <li>00:28:38 - Kim describes how, at each new moon, full moon, solstice, or alignment involving planets like Uranus, a new system appears promising money, power, and government funding for the Deep State before vanishing just as quickly.</li> <li>00:29:22 - She recounts late-night meetings in Russia where Marduk fielded calls from the Rothschilds, Global Headquarters generals, Chinese representatives, and others, spinning riddles and stories that left them scrambling for meaning.</li> <li>00:31:19 - Enlil&#x27;s cryptic sayings, poems sent to Chinese contacts, and tales from Blue Dragon people illustrate how Marduk, Enki, and Enlil kept everyone chasing symbolic puzzles while hiding their true intentions.</li> <li>00:32:12 - Kim concludes that the Dominion system of Marduk was never intended for the Chinese, American, or Russian militaries, but solely for Marduk himself, who would continue to use Deep State operatives until the End of Days unless they choose differently.</li> <li>00:33:29 - She compares artificial overlays to a theater in the round with 3D movies, where people, plants, and scenes seem real but are not, and says the entire Omniverse functioned this way until enough anchors of Source allowed Him to dissolve it from the inside.</li> <li>00:34:48 - Kim uses the example of children torn between divorcing parents to describe the current energetic push-and-pull, as people swing between optimism and exhaustion while Source and remaining AI fields vie for influence.</li> <li>00:37:06 - She warns that Deep State recruiters are aggressively courting human souls, especially those who anchor the most Light, with money, sudden job offers, and invitations to secret societies because Homo sapiens are anchoring too much Source.</li> <li>00:38:14 - Kim notes that the pattern of Chinese infiltration looks different in each region, but Chinese influence is embedded everywhere, even in products labeled &quot;Made in the USA,&quot; while governments promised benefits by China are not seeing results.</li> <li>00:38:54 - She links global government turmoil, on-again-off-again funding, and institutional shutdown threats to repeated attempts to trigger systems that no longer work, while stating that Earth already belongs to Source and to Homo sapiens.</li> <li>00:39:49 - The recent downtick in energies is attributed to attempts to fire up femto tech, which ironically forced Kim and her allies to trace its origin and confront systems that nobody should possess.</li> <li>00:40:13 - Kim explains theta mode as the brain state just before waking or falling asleep, or during meditation and repetitive tasks, emphasizing that Deep State programs frequently ramp at dusk and dawn to infiltrate people when their connection to Source peaks.</li> <li>00:41:58 - She assures listeners that their connection to Source is always available, especially during these theta moments, and reminds them that they are Source&#x27;s army, boots on the ground, and sleeper spies meant to hold the line from within.</li> <li>00:42:49 - Kim describes deliberate sleep disruption via frequencies, shares her own experience of being woken at two in the morning, and says she responds by making coffee, working, and even making skin care products instead of giving up.</li> <li>00:43:24 - She acknowledges collective fatigue but insists that Source will not give up on people and that people will not give up on Source, encouraging them to remember their power despite years of pressure.</li> <li>00:43:59 - Kim advises listeners not to focus obsessively on what the Deep State is doing because it drains their power, instead urging them to invest energy in themselves, their families, their animals, and the things that make them happy.</li> <li>00:45:23 - She summarizes the situation as a push and pull to the very end, saying base root systems that have plagued humanity for a long time are finally being dismantled while Deep State factions lose access to some of their tools.</li> <li>00:45:58 - Kim closes by reminding Deep State operatives who might be listening that Marduk&#x27;s promised systems are just carrots for jackasses, wishes everyone a wonderful Thanksgiving, and promises to speak again later in the week.</li> </ul> </section> <footer class="footer backlink"> <a href="../SummaryIndex.html">Back to Summary Index</a> </footer> </div> </body> </html>
