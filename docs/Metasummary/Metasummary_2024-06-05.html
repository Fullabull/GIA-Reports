She reasserts that the Office of the Comptroller of Currency, now run through her position, remains the ultimate gatekeeper for any real-world currency or bank instrument, while exposing fake servers, offline bonds, and Paris Climate Control Treaty schemes used by Trump operatives, Rothschild managers, and Gulf monarchies to siphon and leverage unbacked assets. Kim describes clawing back Trump-era allocations, collapsing Middle Eastern war funding pipelines, and dismantling synthetic Celestials and Dark-energy infrastructure, while rolling out global transmuter fields that convert remaining Dark energy across Earth, the galaxy, and the Omegaverse. She closes by pointing listeners to Walter Russell's work as a Source-aligned explanation of cosmology and by noting that the old system's operators are running out of power and time, regardless of their attempts to "go it alone."</p> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Highlights</h2> <ul> <li>00:36:18 -
