She then describes a meeting between high-ranking operatives and an insider she calls &quot;the Cowboy,&quot; who reveals deep history: a 6th-century BC off-planet origin, Andromeda-based cyborg-control overlays, and preprogrammed dates in the AI - destined to fail because of recent Source-level changes to the fabric of the universe - that nevertheless drive the mind-controlled SSP into relentless &quot;days ending in Y&quot; attempts to kill off the vast majority of humanity. She frames war as a chaos-harvesting mechanism rather than genuine nation-versus-nation conflict, and ties the planetary control architecture to the Debt System and a specific Debt Clock. This &quot;clock&quot; is depicted as a giant tetrahedron hovering just above the Third Density over the Red Basin of Wyoming - with cords to Homo sapiens and a Death Stone at its center. Multiple dates (Oct. 1-2, 6; Full Moon) were pushed but failed; attempts to materialize a computer-generated Tree of Good and Evil and &quot;goo&quot; entities into our world also failed, blocked by density shifts and loss of access. She asserts that Chaos and Ego are programmatic forces reporting to Death, that Etherium is harvested power, and that dismantling the Debt System severs the energy routes that have, until very recently, underwritten control of our planet. She hints at a possible mutiny among human operatives and says that - regardless of what the operatives decide - they are prepared to &quot;go it alone,&quot; declaring: &quot;The Debt Clock is gone, and time is up for catastrophe payments.&quot;</p> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Highlights</h2> <ul> <li>00:07:07 - Media: Rapture rumor dates (Sep 3; then Oct 1-2; now Oct 6) did not occur.</li> <li>00:08:32 - Media: Reports of sudden country-level shutdowns tied to generals&#x27; meeting fallout.</li> <li>00:10:17 - Disclosure: &quot;Ego&quot; is an AI-to-head overlay driving SSP operatives.</li> <li>00:14:43 - Disclosure: Insider &quot;Cowboy&quot; details off-planet history and ACIO/SSP roles.</li> <li>00:16:53 - Media: &quot;Department of War&quot; naming push.
