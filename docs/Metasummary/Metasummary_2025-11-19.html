Behind the scenes, however, the true story is the collapse of color coded empires that once spanned the Omniverse, controlled by layered AI emperors and managed through royal Dragon Families, Secret Space Programs, and Deep State scriptwriters based in facilities like the 7th Floor of the U.S. State Department and the 13th Floor at HSBC Hong Kong. Over the past week, including a brutal Sunday night and Monday battle, Kim and Source have dismantled the emperor AIs and converted every empire they tore down into an Empire of Source, reclaiming control of Earth, her Central Sun, and the Sols of Homo sapiens. A 2018 offer to nationalize Washington, D.C. and the Federal Reserve for Trump was long ago declined, and new attempts by the Templars and Red empire operatives to obtain a Covenant have been refused. Deep State factions, Secret Space Program operatives, and military and intelligence personnel who served empires are now cut off from their empire covenants and systems like Langley 5, and face a stark choice to continue raising the dead or stand down as Homo sapiens reclaim their inheritance and walk as sovereign citizens of the Empire of Source.</p> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Highlights</h2> <ul> <li>00:00:03 - Opening preview frames the battle of the empires, the fall of the Deep State&#x27;s Empire, and the U.S. government reopening via Epstein file blackmail.</li> <li>00:02:05 - Kim explains how the Epstein files are used globally to blackmail officials and wealthy Middle Eastern families to fund the U.S. government and black ops, not to protect children.</li> <li>00:08:12 - Kim revisits her 2018 letter to Trump offering to nationalize Washington, D.C. and the Federal Reserve, bypass Crown Corporation, and put key assets into true government control.</li> <li>00:09:08 - The Trump administration rejects Kim&#x27;s nationalization offer, preferring to keep the Federal Reserve private and shift control from the Order of the Dragon to the Order of the Black Sun.</li> <li>00:15:02 - Kim lays out how the Omniverse was divided into layered empires by Color, with White, Black, and Red empires controlling royals, Secret Space Programs, and military and intelligence systems through AI emperors.</li> <li>00:23:27 - The Templars attempt to launch a Covenant campaign on Sunday night, triggering an intense battle in which emperor AIs are confronted and begin to disappear, explaining why there was no Monday report.</li> <li>00:33:42 - Kim explains that empires originated from Earth&#x27;s Sol and Central Sun, and that the Great Game of Earth and all related video games were ultimately about controlling the Central Sun of Earth.</li> <li>00:36:56 - Over the weekend, every empire Kim and Source tore down became an empire of Source, making the particles in each person&#x27;s being wholly their own and marking the end of the old game.</li> <li>00:40:47 - Source offers the Deep State and non-Source-origin beings a Covenant, which they effectively decline by asking to think about it, permanently excluding them from the Empire of Source.</li> <li>00:42:34 - Kim says Judgment Day is effectively here, as empires of souls will never be reestablished and all true Sols now belong to the Source Empire of Sols Omniversal wide.</li> <li>00:44:01 - Governments and generals discover that systems like Langley 5 and other domination infrastructures have vanished, leaving them without their former tools of control.</li> <li>00:45:31 - Kim affirms that Homo sapiens are back, their Sols are returning, and the inheritance of Earth granted by Source will not be surrendered.</li> <li>00:47:10 - Wherever a Homo sapiens stands is now considered the Empire of Source, similar to how the old British royals treated the presence of the queen as defining the United Kingdom.</li> <li>00:48:11 - In the coming days, Source Army protections and empire cleanups will continue so Homo sapiens can prosper and fully claim what Source has granted them.</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>People</h2> <ul> <li>Abraxas</li> <li>Donald Trump</li> <li>Lord Rothschild</li> <li>Lucifer</li> <li>Marduk</li> <li>the Li family</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Organizations</h2> <ul> <li>Bank of America</li> <li>Crown Corporation</li> <li>Deep State</li> <li>Dragon Families</li> <li>Empires of Hell</li> <li>Federal Reserve</li> <li>GCHQ</li> <li>Global Intelligence Agency</li> <li>HSBC</li> <li>Jesuit Order</li> <li>JP Morgan</li> <li>Langley 5</li> <li>Order of the Black Sun</li> <li>Order of the Dragon</li> <li>Red empire</li> <li>Secret Space Program</li> <li>Source Army</li> <li>Templars</li> <li>U.S. government</li> <li>the Alliance</li> <li>the Empire of Source</li> <li>the Military and Intelligence empire</li> <li>the White empire</li> <li>the White Hats</li> <li>the Black Hats</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Phrases And Concepts</h2> <ul> <li>Central Sun of Earth</li> <li>Covenant</li> <li>Empire of Source</li> <li>Empires of Hell</li> <li>Great Game of Earth</li> <li>Homo sapiens</li> <li>Judgment Day</li> <li>Military and Intelligence empire</li> <li>Omniverse</li> <li>Red empire</li> <li>Source Empire of Sols</li> <li>Source Light</li> <li>Source Army</li> <li>The Creature From Jekyll Island</li> <li>battle of the empires</li> <li>security equals control</li> <li>scriptwriters of reality</li> <li>the Other Side</li> <li>the Empire</li> <li>the Elite</li> <li>the Game is over</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Locations</h2> <ul> <li>Beijing</li> <li>China</li> <li>Durango</li> <li>Earth</li> <li>Forbidden City</li> <li>Galaxy</li> <li>Hong Kong</li> <li>Jekyll Island</li> <li>Karachi</li> <li>London</li> <li>Middle East</li> <li>Moscow</li> <li>Omniverse</li> <li>Piccadilly</li> <li>Syria</li> <li>Tehran</li> <li>Thames</li> <li>United Kingdom</li> <li>United States</li> <li>Venezuela</li> <li>Washington, D.C.</li> <li>the Solar System</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Events</h2> <ul> <li>00:00:03 -
