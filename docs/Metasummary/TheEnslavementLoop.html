      <h2 id="sec1">Global Financial System and the Looshing System</h2>
      <p>The global Financial System is real. A single global Financial System underpins the entire global world of commerce. This fact is well-known in higher circles, but ordinary people and those without special access are generally ignorant of its existence. And to make things even more interesting, our world’s money system is only half the story. We see dollars, debts, and banks — but above and behind that lies another system even more powerful, that deals not in paper, but in energy. It is the Looshing System. What is loosh? Loosh is energy that all humans produce. But it is not all of our energy. Loosh energy is generated from negative feelings and events: fear and stress, danger and doubt, and all other negative emotions are its source. Events are also a source, such as wars and catastrophes. These emotions and events emit high volumes of frequencies that the Looshing System picks up (harvests). It uses this energy to feed Dark systems - every Dark being and every Dark system depends on loosh for its very survival. The Looshing System also generates “loosh credits” for loosh suppliers, forming a lifeforce-based currency used heavily in off-world trading. Loosh is described as the most sought-after commodity in the Omniverse, and Dark factions eagerly participate in annual loosh auctions, around the Equinox, to secure their needs for the coming year.</p>

      <h2 id="sec2">How Loosh Is Produced and Routed</h2>
      <p>The global Financial System and the Looshing System are closely related through a cycle that involves processes in both systems. The human body is at the heart of this process - the Dark Primordial has constructed Quantum AI overlays that act specifically on humans. These serve as energetic filters between Source and us. By distorting and restricting our natural Source-direct connection, these energetic filters nudge us into fear, conflict, and scarcity — states that produce loosh. That loosh does not flow straight to the ledger; it is first consolidated at distinct collection points. These may be geographic hotspots, such as battlefields, ritual sites, or other events where large groups of people and emotions peak. They can also be institutional nodes such as banks, temples, or government centers where collective focus and obedience accumulate. Other types of collection points are more abstract (and multidimensional) - generally speaking, they are aetheric constructs that range from grid-like planetary overlays, to funnels, columns, and vortices that anchor the non-physical infrastructure. Together these nodes gather and channel the lifeforce output so none of it is lost.</p>

      <h2 id="sec3">Credits, Notes, and the Harvest Loop</h2>
      <p>Credits, notes, and the harvest loop.</p>
      <p>Once these various nodes have gathered the charge, it can be converted into claim-credits (IOUs). Dark beings take these IOUs to auctions (traditionally near the Equinox), where Dark-aligned factions bid for loosh-yield rights. Winners receive the contractual “rite” (right-of-claim) to siphon the loosh their assigned human beings will produce in the next cycle. The human-visible Financial System mirrors and reinforces this hidden ledger, and money functions as a note - a promise instrument - it is not of neutral value. Accepting what we call money is accepting the fine print on that money: that this is a note, an obligation to be a participant in the Looshing System. Acquiring and possessing more notes deepens one’s obligation in this Dark system. And remarkably, spending money actually reinforces this insidious arrangement, and in this framing, earning and spending are two ends of the same loop: work produces loosh because you receive notes, which are actually IOUs disguised as money. And spending those notes just serves to reinforce the scarcity/pressure infrastructure, sustaining the very conditions that generate more loosh.</p>

      <h2 id="sec4">The Enslavement Loop</h2>
      <p>Thus, the global economy and the loosh ledger form a single feedback system of energy, debt-claims, and control, maintained by overlays that limit Source-direct access and keep humanity enslaved to this system that forces us to run like rats on a wheel in return for wallet-sized paper that contractually obligates us to keep running.</p>
