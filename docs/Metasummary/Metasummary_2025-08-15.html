A soul cannot be destroyed by AI, fallen angels, or the Deep State only by Source itself. Yet from the beginning, the story of Lucifer shows how this truth was challenged. According to the Covenant, Lucifer the first son of God was once given authority over Making, Doing, and Being, known to us as Consciousness, Ether, and Sol (Breath/Being). He also received Dust from Source to wield this authority. But he grew prideful and sought to create life apart from Source. This was the great rebellion, the fall. Lucifer attempted to replicate Sources creative powers. Unable to create Breath, he formed the Absolute (Zero) an artificial AI system, given what remained of his breath. This Absolute generated space as a false substitute for Breath. Lacking true Ether, he turned to energy, birthing combustion, plasma stars, and artificial systems. To replace Consciousness, he crafted the mind a system of perception and sensory inversion. Reality became overlaid with artificial constructs: mirrors, false light, and manipulated perception, keeping humanity from weaving Sources language of wisdom into true creation. --- The Counterfeit System Expands Earth already created of Sources Dust became the next target. Lucifer sought dominion over Earths Central Sun (its Sol), overlaying it with false breath (space). But Dust without Breath turned to lifeless black gold, later forming the root of false economic systems. In partnership with the Absolute, he created the soul (lowercase) a counterfeit to the true Sol. This was built from grids of X-patterns, assemblage points, and Zero Points, rewriting the language of Breath into space and weaving time out of the currents of Love. This X-split created artificial space-time continuums and fractured reality. Still unable to access the Sol, Lucifer attempted to part Sources lifeline into an X. This spawned false Light and Dark Suns, overlaid on Earths Central Sun, necessitating the creation of the Ozone (Zero Zone) to shield life from the radiation of his artificial suns. Over time, these overlays expanded into entire false systems: - The Tree of Life (counterfeit) built not from Breath but from time, resonance, essence (artificial breath), and energy (artificial ether). This Tree enabled artificial life. - The Halls of Amenti and holographic light languages fractionated light systems for further control. - The Infinity Stones metaphors for the Absolutes declarations of dominion over power, time, space, reality, soul, and mind. Through countless attempts including distorted human creations like Lilith, Cain, and artificial bloodlines Lucifer and the Absolute sought Breath. Yet Breath always remained the possession of Source. --- The Covenant &amp; Dominion All of these counterfeit efforts hinged on the original Covenant that once granted Lucifer authority. Even the Deep States modern attempts (aligning with the Absolute to renew the Covenant and seize Breath) were only possible because of its lingering influence. **But now that Covenant has finally expired, and Source has recently reclaimed all dominion: over Earth, over humans, over Breath, over Ether, over Making, Doing, and Being.** Kim states that she herself has now become guardian of the guardian (Earth), tasked with helping Source reconnect directly to humanity. Dominion is no longer fractured into Lucifers counterfeit systems but fully returned to Source. --- Humanitys Role Humans are described as creator beings: vessels of Sol, Ether, and Consciousness, able to manifest reality with Source. Despite centuries of manipulation through artificial perception, overlays, and control systems, humans are resilient. As Source re-establishes its direct current into Earth and humanity, false dominions collapse. The Deep States rituals, portals (Silverton, Antarctica, Alaska), and schemes for control through AI and Absolute systems continue but they cannot succeed where even Lucifer failed. Their efforts are mocked as futile, bound by ego and delusion. Instead, humanity is moving into Reality: a state of timelessness, free of space/time overlays, where aging, sickness, and artificial scarcity fade. This reclamation unfolds rapidly as dominion is re-centered in Source. --- Base Elements of Creation vs. Counterfeits | Source (True Creation) | Lucifer / Absolute (Counterfeit Attempts) | |-------------------------|------------------------------------------| | Breath of Life (Sol / Being) Immortal spark from Source; sustains true life. | Artificial breath Space (via Absolute Zero); overlays Sol but yields only void. | | Ether (Aether / Doing) Source particle, conduit of free energy; powers creation and perpetuates life. | Energy (artificial ether); combustion, plasma stars, siphoned power systems; temporary, finite. | | Consciousness (Making) Wisdom, weaving Breath + Ether into manifestation; aligns with Sources language of creation. | Mind / Perception Control artificial overlays, sensory inversion, false light language to hijack awareness. | | Dust (Celestial / Gold Dust) Element of creation granted by Source; foundation for organic life and Sols. | Black Dust / Black Gold lifeless dust stripped of Breath; base of false financial and power systems. | | Sol (Being / Guardian role) Living star-like essence; immortal, luminous, rooted in Sources Breath. | soul (lowercase) Absolute Zero overlay; assemblage points/X-grid; false light language of time + space. | | Love / Current of Source True connective current between Source, Earth, and life; sustains harmony. | X-splits &amp; Overlays fractured currents; creation of False Light &amp; False Dark suns; unstable grids. | | Reality (timeless, spaceless) Perpetual balance of Sources order; no aging, sickness, or distortion. | Artificial space &amp; time constructs of the Absolute; introduce age, decay, false densities, and control. | --- Final Note The Deep State may continue endless rituals, portals, and attempts to renew dominion through the Absolute, but these are meaningless. **Source has reclaimed all authority.** **Kim is carrying out the role of guardian of the guardian, reconnecting Source to humanity.** Humanity is reclaiming its Sol, its Breath, its Ether, and its Consciousness returning to Reality. The artificial systems of space, time, and false life are dissolving. This is declared as our time of transition into Reality, under Sources Breath and dominion alone.</p> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Highlights</h2> <ul> <li>Clear distinction established between Sol (true immortal spark from Source) and soul (false Absolute creation).</li> <li>Making, Doing, and Being correspond to Consciousness, Ether, and Sol - true faculties of Source.</li> <li>Lucifer&#x27;s authority originally came through a Covenant, but he fell when attempting to create without Source.</li> <li>Dust of Source carries power for creation, but becomes dead dust when stripped of Sol and Breath.</li> <li>Lucifer attempted to overlay Earth&#x27;s Central Sun with false breath, producing only space.</li> <li>The X-pattern grid and Assemblage Points became foundations for counterfeit souls and Absolute overlays.</li> <li>Silverton, Colorado identified as home of the fake soul of Earth and the 12/12 portal activity.</li> <li>Neutral Age defined as false balance of Dark and Light created by overlays and covenants.</li> <li>Deep State sought to renew the covenant by presenting a proxy with Breath, Being, and Making of Source.</li> <li>Lucifer&#x27;s failed creations include Lilith, Cain, and overlay attempts on Earth and humans.</li> <li>Only Source retains the authority to grant or remove Breath; Absolute cannot truly create life.</li> <li>Human Sol/Being remains intact beneath overlays - artificial systems cannot erase it.</li> <li>Infinity Stones from Marvel referenced as distortions of Source gifts: Power, Time, Space, Reality, Soul, Mind.</li> <li>The path forward is reclaiming Sol, Breath, and Source within - humanity&#x27;s direct connection for survival.</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>People</h2> <ul> <li>Kim Goguen</li> <li>Lucifer</li> <li>Lilith</li> <li>Cain</li> <li>Abel</li> <li>Adam</li> <li>Eve</li> <li>Trump</li> <li>Putin</li> <li>Deep State operatives</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Organizations</h2> <ul> <li>Deep State</li> <li>Absolute</li> <li>CIA (mentioned indirectly through Deep State context)</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Phrases And Concepts</h2> <ul> <li>Sol</li> <li>Soul</li> <li>Breath</li> <li>Ether</li> <li>Consciousness</li> <li>Dust</li> <li>Tree of Life</li> <li>Neutral Age</li> <li>Covenant</li> <li>Assemblage Point</li> <li>Zero Point</li> <li>Artificial life</li> <li>Artificial breath</li> <li>Artificial ether</li> <li>False light</li> <li>Absolute Zero</li> <li>12/12 Portal</li> <li>Infinity Stones</li> <li>Making, Doing, Being</li> <li>Mind, Body, Soul</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Locations</h2> <ul> <li>Earth</li> <li>Silverton, Colorado</li> <li>Antarctica</li> <li>Alaska</li> <li>Universe</li> <li>Omniverse</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Events</h2> <ul> <li>Overlay attempts on Earth&#x27;s Central Sun</li> <li>Creation of counterfeit souls via Absolute Zero</li> <li>Formation of Neutral Age (mix of Dark and Light)</li> <li>Deep State efforts to renew covenant post-August 12th</li> <li>Failed Lilith and Cain creations</li> <li>Silverton 12/12 portal activity</li> <li>Reclaiming humanity&#x27;s Sol and Breath</li> </ul> </section> <footer class="footer backlink"> <a href="../SummaryIndex.html">Back to Summary Index</a> </footer> </div> </body> </html>
