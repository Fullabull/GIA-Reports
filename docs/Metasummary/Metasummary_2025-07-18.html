She states that national governments, wars, and elections are pre-written performances designed to control perception, while Deep State actors, SSP programs, and non-human factions fight over ancient deep underground military bases that support travel, experimentation, cloning, and interdimensional access. Kim emphasizes that nearly every country contains such facilities, and that citizens, soldiers, and patriots unknowingly serve systems that despise them, feeding financial, medical, and food-based control grids. She explains that the true solution for humanity is not political resistance but rebuilding local communities, sourcing food and essentials locally, planning together, and seeing themselves as sovereign custodians of Earth. She concludes by urging viewers to focus on self-reliance, community resilience, and Creator connection while the Deep State collapses under its own failed plans.</p> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Highlights</h2> <ul> <li>00:00:13 - Kim says mainstream narratives and intel chatter about July events are scripted distractions that never materialize.</li> <li>00:03:13 - She clarifies that Israel and other nations do not act autonomously and are used as Deep State tools in staged conflicts.</li> <li>00:07:01 - Wars are described as pre-planned operations where no military has ever won or made decisions independently.</li> <li>00:09:30 - Kim urges military members and families to recognize they are being used and placed in harm&#x27;s way for no purpose.</li> <li>00:18:17 - She explains that most police, military, and medical workers join with good intentions but are misled and controlled through limited information.</li> <li>00:21:45 - Syria is highlighted as a gateway region linked to massive deep underground military bases and interdimensional access points.</li> <li>00:24:13 - Kim states that modern Space Force fronts exist to fund black programs while SSP factions handle real transport and operations.</li> <li>00:28:59 - Governments, rebel groups, and patriot movements are portrayed as controlled opposition serving the same power structures.</li> <li>00:33:43 - Deep underground bases are described as sites for experimentation, human trafficking, and biological and consciousness engineering.</li> <li>00:37:55 - Kim says below certain facility levels no humans are allowed and SSP operatives unknowingly serve non-human agendas.</li> <li>00:41:18 - She lists global DUMBs and claims every country hosts facilities that operate in coordination.</li> <li>00:43:32 - Kim asserts that patriots jailed after January 6 acted scripted roles and were abandoned by the same forces that directed them.</li> <li>00:45:19 - Major food companies are tied to deep underground bases and poisoning systems embedded in global food supply chains.</li> <li>00:47:03 - She advises communities to build their own food systems rather than attempting to resist militarily.</li> <li>00:49:33 - Kim explains that she misleads SSP groups strategically to trap or neutralize sophon operatives.</li> <li>00:52:55 - Recruitment pipelines are said to pull hackers, soldiers, and influencers into Deep State networks worldwide.</li> <li>00:55:09 - The Deep State is described as financially collapsing as fake currency schemes fail and deadlines pass without payout.</li> <li>00:57:20 - She reveals Elon Musk has been promised leadership of a New World Order, but asserts it will never come to pass.</li> <li>00:58:11 - Kim concludes by urging viewers to prepare locally, build community systems, and ignore political theatrics.</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>People</h2> <ul> <li>Elon Musk</li> <li>Kim Goguen</li> <li>Lucifer</li> <li>Thule Base Personnel</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Organizations</h2> <ul> <li>CIA</li> <li>DARPA</li> <li>Deep State</li> <li>NSA</li> <li>Secret Space Program</li> <li>United States government</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Phrases And Concepts</h2> <ul> <li>Community resilience</li> <li>Deep State actor</li> <li>Deep underground military base</li> <li>Mind control</li> <li>One World Government</li> <li>Patriot movement</li> <li>Prime Wars</li> <li>Secret Space Program</li> <li>Sophon</li> <li>Thule base</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Locations</h2> <ul> <li>Area 51</li> <li>China</li> <li>Crimea</li> <li>Greenland</li> <li>Syria</li> <li>United States</li> </ul> </section> <footer class="footer backlink"> <a href="../SummaryIndex.html">Back to Summary Index</a> </footer> </div> </body> </html>
