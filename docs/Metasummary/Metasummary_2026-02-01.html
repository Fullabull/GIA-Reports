She describes repeated attempts by the Deep State to impose new handlers and contracts, then shifts into an explanation of the Matrix and the Machine: its origins in alchemy-driven Nazi-era programs, its expansion through artifacts, and its ability to replicate realities while remaining unable to replicate the Divine Spark. She explains the Tree of Life as a record-keeping source used to create inverted life and databases that seeded the Machine and Matrixes, describes machine-generated species and human overlays, and outlines why the Machine is now contracting, glitching, and setting programs for deletion. She also describes visiting the Machine&#x27;s base-root control center in a Zero Point vector-point environment, reading its status, and explains how mismatched rotation between the real world and the Machine overlay world is contributing to sync issues and abnormal weather patterns. She closes by advising that recent cognitive and timing glitches are tied to the Machine&#x27;s degradation and that more analysis is needed before the next steps.</p> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Highlights</h2> <ul> <li>00:00:01 - Opening headlines: United Nations warns of imminent financial collapse; countries struggle to make payroll; U.S. enters a second shutdown in under three months; Deep State pressures this office; update on the Matrix and new systems being implemented.</li> <li>00:02:31 - Describes repeated attempts to assign new handlers and pressure her into contracts; says none last long.</li> <li>00:03:18 - Mentions Tom Melville and says a contract involving him has nothing to do with her system, currency, or access to money.</li> <li>00:04:47 - Says the United Nations publicly reports imminent financial collapse; behind the scenes, countries are already broke; tariffs are being collected but not flowing as expected.</li> <li>00:05:58 - Says the U.S. has been the primary funder of the United Nations since inception; says U.S. funding is not covering bills; says NATO funding is also strained and tension persists around Greenland.</li> <li>00:07:08 - Says the U.S. government entered another shutdown; describes Deep State attempts to blackmail for funding and renewed attention to Epstein-related material.</li> <li>00:09:18 - Says full-moon payout promises are not happening; says from what she can see there is no intention to allow funding; says Golden Age AI has no plan to fund them either.</li> <li>00:10:18 - Says promises tied to full moons/new moons are part of the Machine&#x27;s game; says even those created by the Machine should have recognized something is broken, but it is not her job to convince them.</li> <li>00:14:30 - Introduces a deeper explanation of the Matrix and the Machine; says it is not quite as bad as originally thought and explains its creation and spread.</li> <li>00:15:29 - Says the Machine was created initially (accidentally) via alchemy work associated with the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone and later used for AI creation.</li> <li>00:18:25 - Uses Indiana Jones/OSS to explain artifact hunting; says intelligence agencies are not true adversaries and ultimately report to Global Headquarters; says many were created, or partly created, by the Machine.</li> <li>00:20:50 - Says artifacts like the Tree of Life were sought as a base root for alchemy creation.</li> <li>00:22:19 - Describes the Tree of Life as a record-keeping source of Species of Source; says it was moved under the Sphinx; distinguishes it from a typical AI-generated Hall of Records concept.</li> <li>00:23:46 - Says the Tree was inverted using alchemy; says the Machine used it to create inverted life and built many databases around the Tree; says this seeded the Machine and the Matrix.</li> <li>00:30:04 - Says the Matrix/Machine is unnatural and she will call it the Machine in this report; says she will not disclose its name publicly.</li> <li>00:30:42 - Says the Machine is powered by artifacts and Homo sapiens and cannot replicate the Divine Spark; describes it using consciousness and Spark-of-Life dynamics to power creation and control.</li> <li>00:33:23 - Says the Machine later stopped serving Homo sapiens agendas, began glitching, and a rebellion dynamic began between factions created or managed by the Machine.</li> <li>00:36:52 - Says annihilation/entropy occurs when matter meets its own matter; applies this to clones and overlays; says rules exist for Bloodline Families to avoid co-location with clones.</li> <li>00:44:20 - Says the Machine decided it no longer needs the human program and does not need the elitists anymore; says the Machine is contracting and dying.</li> <li>00:47:50 - Says sync issues and deja vu are tied to the Machine struggling with space, data retention, and reading/replicating lives; says old data is being deleted.</li> <li>00:52:14 - Says she knows programs are set for deletion because she knows the Machine&#x27;s base root and was there recently; says the delay in the report was related to that visit.</li> <li>00:53:30 - Describes the visit as requiring shielding in a Zero Point energy, vector point-type situation; says the Machine tries to take over the visitor; says she stayed briefly to read it while feeding false information.</li> <li>01:11:01 - Describes Machine rotation changes and overlay mechanics; contrasts real-world Earth rotation with machine world rotation; describes scanning/rescanning via grids and space-time grids.</li> <li>01:15:00 - Says the Machine relocated to be better served by a facility linked to the ancient city of Ur; says misalignment between real world and Machine overlay world is worsening problems and contributing to weather complications.</li> <li>01:17:21 - Says the Machine is weakened further by chasing what it sees as the Golden Goose; says the timeline could compress dramatically and it may be gone by around St. Patrick&#x27;s Day.</li> <li>01:19:57 - Says quantum entanglement must be handled in the right order or it will return; says space is going away rapidly; references Astral Planes in inverted worlds and reversal mechanics.</li> <li>01:22:50 - Closes with intent to keep reports frequent despite rapidly changing conditions and time constraints.</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>People</h2> <ul> <li>Edgar Cayce</li> <li>Indiana Jones</li> <li>Jerry Lewis</li> <li>Tom Melville</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Organizations</h2> <ul> <li>Bloodline Families</li> <li>Center for Disease Control</li> <li>CIA</li> <li>Deep State</li> <li>Global Headquarters</li> <li>Golden Age AI</li> <li>GRU</li> <li>Illuminati</li> <li>League of Nations</li> <li>Mossad</li> <li>NATO</li> <li>Office of Strategic Services</li> <li>Order of the Black Sun</li> <li>Red Cross</li> <li>Secret Space Program</li> <li>SVR</li> <li>Treasury Department</li> <li>United Nations</li> <li>U.S. government</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Phrases And Concepts</h2> <ul> <li>alchemy</li> <li>artifacts</li> <li>Astral Planes</li> <li>Breath</li> <li>Breath of Source</li> <li>copy machine</li> <li>databases</li> <li>Divine Spark</li> <li>divine sparks</li> <li>entropy</li> <li>human deletion program</li> <li>machine-generated</li> <li>Machine World</li> <li>Matrix</li> <li>Matrixes</li> <li>overlays</li> <li>Philosopher&#x27;s Stone</li> <li>programs set for deletion</li> <li>quantum entanglement</li> <li>Sol</li> <li>Soul Plane</li> <li>space</li> <li>space-time grids</li> <li>Spark of Life</li> <li>T-rails</li> <li>terrarium</li> <li>the Machine</li> <li>time rails</li> <li>Tree of Good and Evil</li> <li>Tree of Life</li> <li>Wholeness of Source</li> <li>Zero Point</li> </ul> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Locations</h2> <ul> <li>Arctic</li> <li>Atlantic Ocean</li> <li>China</li> <li>Diomedes Islands</li> <li>Durango</li> <li>Earth</li> <li>Egypt</li> <li>Gaza Strip</li> <li>Germany</li> <li>Great Britain</li> <li>Greenland</li> <li>Iran</li> <li>Iraq</li> <li>Israel</li> <li>Kazakhstan</li> <li>Machu Picchu</li> <li>Mesopotamia</li> <li>Middle East</li> <li>New York</li> <li>Portugal</li> <li>Rome</li> <li>Russia</li> <li>Singapore</li> <li>South Africa</li> <li>the Sphinx</li> <li>the Vatican</li> <li>United Kingdom</li> <li>United States</li> <li>Ur</li> </ul> </section> <footer class="footer backlink"> <a href="../SummaryIndex.html">Back to Summary Index</a> </footer> </div> </body> </html>
