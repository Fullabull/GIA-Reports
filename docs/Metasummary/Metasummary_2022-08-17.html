As the agreement reaches its expiry on the 20th, Jared Kushner, Juan O&#x27;Savin, Chinese and Asian elders, and other Order-aligned actors attempt to renew it through a hidden contract laden with curses and Gematria, while simultaneously leveraging the Leo Wanta myth and alleged trillions in off-ledger &#x27;tear sheets&#x27; to fund a controlled U.S. crash, civil war, and a transfer of power to China&#x27;s Deep State. When checks on Sunday night reveal that the Wanta funds have been gone since 2019, Kushner panics, orders threats against members of Congress and other officials, and pressures Juan to stall meetings with Kim while lawyers draft a new covenant meant to bind her into supporting their takeover plan. Kim states that she has already refused, has replaced the expiring agreement with the reign of the People of the World, and warns patriots, militias, and generals that donations to the Trump camp are being used by Kushner and Juan O&#x27;Savin to fund operations and social-media narratives designed to ignite civil war and justify a financial collapse that would allow Dragon Families to buy the United States for pennies on the dollar. In the second half of the report, she lays out the current structure of the planes of existence within a person, explaining how Dragon Families and their black-magic systems built programs such as Incarnate, Alienation, Outcast, Salvation, Solitude, Investure, Fear, and the Shadow Self into the Supranal, Optimal, Physical, Astral, Causal, Emotional, Etherical, Mental, and Soul Planes to fractionate pure white light and prevent humans from becoming whole Beings connected to Source. With the expiration of the agreement, she says these control programs are dissolving, the Etherical Plane is shifting from mixed dark-light silver back toward purity, and people may feel old fears and memories surfacing as the planes re-integrate. Kim asserts that the Mar-a-Lago raid was warranted and that Trump knowingly participated in election fraud, chose to leave office in hopes of a higher position in the Order, and allowed many harms to be scheduled for after his presidency so he could still be marketed as a savior. She urges agencies and militaries worldwide to recognize the true roles of Kushner, Juan O&#x27;Savin, and their Dragon Family handlers, to prevent a civil war and foreign Deep State takeover, and to choose the emerging reign of the people over the collapsing reign of the Elites.</p> </section> <section class="section"> <h2>Highlights</h2> <ul> <li>00:01:48 - Kim and Sunny pivot from light banter into the week's events and the intense behind-the-scenes meetings happening near Kim.</li> <li>00:03:24 - Kim traces current events back to Solomon&#x27;s Bloodline Curse, an agreement made after Solomon&#x27;s Second Temple that empowered the Dragon Families and the Rothschildian Order.</li> <li>00:05:11 - Elders from China, Asia, the Philippines, Russia, and White Dragon circles contact Kim to form a new agreement as the old covenant approaches its expiry on the 20th.</li> <li>00:06:36 - An agency stand-in for Trump is confronted with Kim&#x27;s terminal communications and signatures, exposing that he is not fully read in and prompting Kushner&#x27;s new-contract scheme.</li> <li>00:08:37 - Kim reveals that Juan O&#x27;Savin has been waving around trillions in alleged Wanta &#x27;tear sheets&#x27;
